&#62; Blizzard-
&#62; When I paid my $48.73 for my CD of Diablo, I wasn't aware I'd be 
&#62; subjugated to the whims of childish profanity, spamming, and the 
&#62; constant 
&#62; use of nicknames I can't even copy to squelch due to their incessant 
&#62; use of 
&#62; symbols.  I think if Blizzard is going to offer a chat as a way to 
&#62; hook up with 
&#62; others to play their product, then they should have the insight to 
&#62; know that 
&#62; there has to be some standards of decorum and some way of enforcing 
&#62; them.  Perhaps you all should take a look at Westwood chat for an 
&#62; example.  
&#62; My suggestion to you all is to make the chat where a channel op is 
&#62; present in 
&#62; every channel and to take some of the profits from the 13 million you 
&#62; boast 
&#62; so proudly about, and hire some system operators.  Many of my friends 
&#62; no 
&#62; longer play the game because of these unruly infantile adolescents, 
&#62; and have 
&#62; sworn off Blizzard products all together.  Since, most of these 
&#62; children can 
&#62; not afford your price for a CD, whereas my friends, and the other 
&#62; adults on 
&#62; bnet can, it seems like a bad business strategy to allow this to 
&#62; continue.
&#62; Thank you for your time.

Yeah, you pretty much covered the playing field there, so i really 
have nothing to add to it.  Except that i agree entirely (i haven't 
sworn off all Blizzard products, i still want to see Diablo 2).
Battle.net is a severe case of the many ruining it for the many...
An explanation?  There are about as many cheaters and dupers and 
hackers as there are legits.  The one half is ruining it for the 
other.  Perhaps in Diablo 2 (aside from increasing variety) a 
separate server (this old one) could be used for the morons who enjoy 
playing the game the &#34;easy&#34; way, while a stricter server 
would service the players who play the game the way it was meant to 
be played.

oh well, it'll never happen but i'll be buying Diablo 2 non-the-less.

later.
