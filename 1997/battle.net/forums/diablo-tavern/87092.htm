<pre>	Well, after waging a small war with my website and having to format 
my entire hard drive I have finally found some time to get the next 
part up. Actually my hard drive is fried so I'm having to run my OS 
and Netscape off one of my cartridges for my portable drive. Now if 
the stupid cart could hold more than 130 megs I'd be a little more 
happy. I am also going to use this ocation to announce my new 
website: I have a new website. (Woah, deep.) I'm still adding more 
material to the site but I feel enough of it is complete for your 
viewing pleasure. So, if you are totally bored and want to waste some 
of your valuable time on the net head on over to my site. Thanks to 
all of you out there who have been reading my stories. Every little 
comment really helps (a little $ doesn't hurt much either.) Cohen! Is 
my memory really as bad as I think it is or do I recall you saying 
that you have not seen Braveheart yet?! Don't even bother renting it. 
Buy it. Trust me. The spacing and general lay out of my story may 
appear a little messed up (tech problems), so please bare with me.

Part III


	&#34;Let go of me!&#34;, cried the young woman as the dark creature 
dragged her before it's unholy master. She was thrown onto the muddy 
ground and then given a swift kick to the midsection. She let out a 
yelp of pain. As the young woman was able to regain her breath she 
cautiously looked up at the dark figure who was standing before her. 
As she met his luminescent ruby eyes she could feel a wave of terror 
and helplessness wash over her.

	With a cruel twisted smile Stonehaven reached out and caressed the 
woman's beautiful but soiled face. She recoiled and as a result 
recieved a massive blow to her lower back from one of his evil 
minions standing guard. Another soldier, a living skeleton clad in 
polished black armour, grabbed the woman by the hair and raised her 
head so that she was staring at Stonehaven.

	In a voice that dripped with vile contempt and carefully cencealed 
rage Stonehaven spoke to the young woman. &#34;Do you smell 
that?&#34;, he asked her, &#34;that is the smell of your fellow 
villagers being burned alive.&#34; He then pointed to a column of 
black smoke billowing in the distance. The woman could see her fellow 
villagers struggling as Stonehaven's soldiers carelessly threw them 
into a massive burning pit. &#34;I will make this simple for 
you&#34;, continued Stonehaven, &#34;tell me where your village elder 
is hiding and you all will recieve quick painless deaths.&#34; The 
woman was breathing heavily with rage and sorrow as she listened to 
the sounds of her friends writhing in pain as their flesh was cracked 
by the fire. &#34;Still not motivated, young one?&#34;, questioned 
Stonehaven in a condescending voice. The woman spat at Stonehaven's 
feet. The guard then swung his flail at the woman breaking her left 
arm causing the broken bone to protrude. She bit her tongue refusing 
to cry out. Stonehaven waved his hand motioning another soldier to 
bring in another prisoner. He was treated in the same manner as the 
woman. He was clad in filthy blood stained armour and his face was 
marked by many open wounds. The woman, seeing the man out of the 
corner of her eye, yelled out, &#34;Fayn!&#34; The man recognized the 
woman as his sister and tried to speak but could only manage a few 
gutteral noises. &#34;What have you done to him?!&#34;, demanded the 
woman who was now drawing on her pain for strength. &#34;A pitty, 
that one&#34;, Stonehaven said with a slight grin, &#34;he just could 
not manage to give us the information we required so I had his tongue 
removed. Well, removed isn't exactly the right term; more along the 
lines of 'pulled out'.&#34; Stonehaven chuckled for a few moments. 
The woman hung her head and began to weep. &#34;Now!&#34;, said 
Stonehaven who was growing tired of the interrogation, &#34;tell me 
the location of your elder and your brother shall live.&#34; 
&#34;Very well&#34;, said the woman in a defeated voice, &#34;he fled 
with some others to the hamlet of Viscoune.&#34; &#34;See? That 
wasn't so difficult now was it?&#34;, Stonehaven mocked. 
&#34;Beradomar!&#34;, called Stonehaven. A towering warrior lumbered 
over to the site of the interrogation. &#34;Yes, my Lord&#34;, he 
replied. Stonehaven pointed to Fayn. A toothy smile crept across 
Beradomar's face. He walked over to the prisoner, put on a steel 
glove with sharpened serrated claws, and reached into Fayn's stomach 
area removing his intestines. A horrendous cry of pain errupted from 
Fayn. Fayn's sister cried out, &#34;you lied! You said that you would 
let him live!&#34; Stonehaven's face suddenly went horribly dark with 
anger and struck the woman's face. She was sent through the air 
several meters by the blow before landing on the ground some distance 
away. Her skull had been shattered by Stonehaven's strike. &#34;Throw 
her and her brother into the pit&#34;, ordered Stonehaven. Two 
skeletal warriors picked up the bodies and headed towards the fire.

	A human warrior, Janar, who had betrayed his newly conquered village 
approached Stonehaven and asked, &#34;my Lord, why did you kill her? 
She told you where the elder was hiding.&#34; Stonehaven glared down 
at the human with some impatience. Janar stepped back a few paces 
sensing his master's angered mood. Stonehaven replied, &#34;we 
destroyed Viscoune nine days ago and I have to admit they put up a 
far more valiant struggle than this dung heap you call a 
village.&#34; Even though Janar had opted to join Stonehaven's army 
and murder his own people he still felt slightly insulted by the 
remark. &#34;Come&#34;, said Stonehaven to Janar, &#34;we have much 
to discuss about your future role in my army.&#34; With those last 
spoken words the two tyrants entered the war tent.

	Stonehaven's eyes suddenly fluttered open. The morning sun was 
beaming down onto his face which posessed a distressed expression. He 
could heare the sounds of armour being fastened, blades of all 
assortment being inspected and then sheathed, and the clacking of 
arrows jostling about in their quivers as they were slung onto backs. 
The draconian stood up from the clump of hay he had slept on during 
the early morning hours. He had never felt comfortable sleeping in 
doors. Stonehaven noticed Stephen with a group of Snakegods. He 
walked over to his unbalanced friend. &#34;I don't suppose you wish 
to explain all the comotion?&#34;, Stonehaven asked his friend. 
Stephen turned to Stonehaven with a grim look on his face. &#34;Soome 
teime laast noyght a membar oof Snakegod disappeared by the oold 
charch and haasn't bin seen sence. Weer go'in aftar hem.&#34; 
Stonehaven shuddered at the thought of returning to those awful 
tunnels. 

	&#34;Stonehaven!&#34;, called Salmissra as she walked up to the 
growing ranks of Snakegods and members of Ordo Rosea Moriatur, 
&#34;we could really use a dragon's company where we're going&#34;, 
she stated. &#34;I know&#34;, replied Stonehaven who knew all too 
well what was awaiting them in those dark bowels of the earth. 
Slamissra gave Stonehaven a curious look. &#34;You know of the 
catacombs?&#34;, she asked rather surprised. &#34;Yes. I have 
ventured through the catacombs and beyond many times&#34;, replied 
Stonehaven who had a worried look to his face. &#34;But you have 
never been seen before here in Tristram. How could you possibly 
journey through the catacombs without first going through the 
village?&#34;, Slamissra asked again. She was becoming very 
suspicious of the draconian. &#34;It is a long story that I am not 
ready to speak of yet&#34;, said Stonehaven. &#34;Very well&#34;, 
said Salmissra as she re-checked her bow string. She glanced once 
more at Stonehaven still pondering his story. 

	&#34;Brrrotherrr......&#34; Stonehaven, unoticed by the others, 
jumped at the voice that had suddenly appeared in his mind. 
Stonehaven looked to the entrance to the cathedral. &#34;Good luck be 
with you, my friends&#34;, Stonehaven said as he turned away from the 
small army. &#34;Joost wherre the hell doo yoou think yoour 
gooin?&#34;, questioned Stephen. Salmissra and the others turned to 
see Stonehaven walking away and towards the tavern. 
&#34;Stonehaven!&#34;, Slamissra called after the dark one. &#34;I'm 
sorry. I cannot join you. At least not at the moment.&#34;, 
Stonehaven called back. &#34;Coward&#34;, hissed Cohen. Stephen 
glanced angrily at the warrior. &#34;Waatch yoour toongue, 
baarbaarian. Ei've knoown Stoonehaven foor many years and he joost 
dooesn't abandoon hes friends withoout a good reasoon.&#34; &#34;It's 
true&#34;, Wiseman interjected, &#34;something which I am unable to 
explain just yet has been troubling Stonehaven. I could sense it the 
first night he entered the village.&#34; 

	Salmissra gave one final look to Stonehaven as he entered the 
tavern. She was still puzzled at his actions. &#34;Never mind&#34;, 
she said to her fellow Snakegods, &#34;we have a grim task ahead of 
us. If we cannot locate Morteleux before the sun sets we must leave 
and return to the surface. Agreed?&#34; Voices of approval rose from 
the mass of Snakegods. Salmissra continued, &#34;Ordo Rosea Moriatur 
has agreed to acompany us in our rescue of Morteleux. I sincerely 
hope that we do not lose any one down there.&#34; Salmissra and 
several high ranking memers of Ordo then began to lead their army 
into the cathedral.

	Stonehaven held his head in his hands as he sat at a secluded table. 
He could not silence the voice which he so hoped he would not have to 
deal with here. &#34;Brrrotherrr...welcommme hhhommme...&#34;
