<pre>Well since I &#34;forgot&#34; to go to class today I've had time to 
go and check out some of our member sites with scrutiny.  I've also 
been reading some of our posts here at Ogden's (damn Rikor...you're 
funny!).  All of the sites were very well done and are nice 
representations of our clan.  Lepthana deserves a nod of recognition 
for taking the 3 guild idea and running with it....Saturday should 
finish things up. 
     Now as most of you know...I have many friends that are &#34;bad 
guys&#34; since I was with Inferno for so long.   Even after I joined 
Snakegod, I continually got questions about who my affiliation will 
be once UO comes out and my generic answer was &#34;I'll have to play 
it and decide then&#34;.  Well, I've actually made up my mind 
already.  When UO is finally public (I'm not a beta tester) I'm 
sticking with Snakegod.  Being a good little warrior has been a 
helluva lot more fun and more fullfilling.  The clan is filled with 
great people and I'm looking forward to continuing our ongoing 
relationship for many, many months ahead.   So with all that long-
winded stuff said and done....I just wanted to send out a big THANKS 
to all our members for making this guild a fun, happy place to be on 
b.net.
                               Kariyafan

PS &#34;oh geez, somebody get the ambassador a tissue!&#34; </pre>
