&#62; in command (under spell) i hereby order you to say now if you cheat 
&#62; or not.if you do, then admit it, and we can forgive and forget, if 
&#62; you dont, and are totally honest, then things go on like usual, but 
&#62; if you say you ddint, and i hear something of this again, i think 
&#62; salmissra needs to hear about it.
&#62; 
&#62; ok, as for public games, i , during the past two months, played more 
&#62; public games then private...people dont believe me when i say this, 
&#62; but its true..i just didnt use kai.


Well, this is true, and I would also like to thank BLZ.  When I got 
back from that game with Shaft6 the first thing I did was /msg d're 
who was in the channel, told him my plan of pking/mking snakegods, 
and how I just mked shaft6 and he had obsid zods.  At first Eugene 
didn't think Shaft6 was Snakegod, but I told him Shaft6 told me he 
was.  I then told Eugene and Anubisan I was working on Lep, and they 
laughed along with me.  Now, BLZ is right, I am evil, I will decieve 
my prey, but that is all with being a PK.  PKING is not DUELING, and 
if I pk some guy is legit and he challenges me after I pk or mk him, 
I will accept the challenge.  Shaft6, I am an experienced PK from the 
old days.  I don't lie, except to decieve my victims in games, but 
afterwards there is no reason to lie.  You may as well come clean to 
your fellow Snakegod members, and face up to it like a man.  I'm sure 
you won't get booted out, as it takes a lot of guts to come forward 
and admit your wrongs.  Otherwise maybe I hunt you with another 
character sometime and bring a witnes..mwuhahhahah....

Later.
