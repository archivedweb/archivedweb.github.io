&#62; I have browsed recent post and see several on pking. My question is 
&#62; this:
&#62; 
&#62; WHERE ARE THE LEGIT PKERS? WHERE?
&#62; 
&#62; It seems there are a surplus of pkers who can't play worth a crap and 
&#62; therefore must use cheats to gain an advantage. Some cheat because co-
&#62; ops are cheating which is even worse (co-op peope----CMON! This game 
&#62; IS NOT that hard! Don't give me that &#34;my limited online time 
&#62; bullshit&#34;)
&#62; 
&#62; I remember playing public games in January. I personally like to play 
&#62; co-op, but with public games you always have to watch your back 
&#62; (exciting to me). I was in the church with my rogue on one occasion, 
&#62; plucking away at Fallen Ones alongside a warrior. The warrior was 
&#62; apparently was bored with Fallen Ones and decided he wanted a piece 
&#62; of me without even a word..... But I must admit I had killer legs :)
&#62; 
&#62; But it was 2 normal characters in battle.  No &#34;special&#34; 
&#62; software, no KSOH, GPOW(indest.), etc. I had to defend myself against 
&#62; a &#34;bandit&#34; (reference to a previous excellent post). That was 
&#62; fun. I like co-op, he liked pk, he attacked me, I won. Heheh. No 
&#62; complaints here! :)
&#62; 
&#62; I have also been killed as well. And for only the mere thrill. No 
&#62; gold or ear was taken. Oh well, better find better stuff I thought to 
&#62; myself...so that next time I'll have his ear!
&#62; 
&#62; So much for that aspect of the game. :(
&#62; 
&#62; Oh well, it was fun. Happy bnetting,
&#62; Gorn

Hehe, we of the Inferno is still here. I AM here. Well, lately it 
seems the old debate about Pking is starting again, and some new 
interesting points has been made. 

I have to admit that cheat programs made LOTS of losers with no skill 
so-called Pkers. We, the legit pkers are still here, but I have to 
say we are a minority now. Anyway, I would like to have your ear! 

We will meet on b.net! 

(Nothing personal, but since you killed a Pk, I would like to try my 
luck. hehe )
