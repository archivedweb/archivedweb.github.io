&#62; I finally got the CD today, and registered.  Took forever to get 
&#62; online, but I did get in and spent about an HOUR without a single 
&#62; crash.  It was incredible.  The game is mucho improved over phase 1, 
&#62; with less lag and obviously more stability.  The only problem was a 
&#62; shortage of animals... everybody was looking for a bunny to bash.  
&#62; I did find one fierce opponent.... a RAT.  That's right, my first 
&#62; fight in phase 2 was with a rat.  Fortunately I won.  I ran into a 
&#62; cougar, but decided not to try my luck since I'm stuck with a dagger.
&#62; Checking my backpack revealed a better inventory than with phase 1.  
&#62; As a warrior I started with a shield, and a long sword.  
&#62; Unfortunately, I'm too weak to use the sword..... hence, the dagger.
&#62; 
&#62; ICQ works with UO!  BLZ_BOB and I tried for an hour to hook up in 
&#62; Vesper, but he was experiencing some major lag and never could get 
&#62; rolling.  With ICQ running, you can chat while you play... otherwise 
&#62; I am not sure you can communicate with other players while in 
&#62; Britannia.
&#62; 
&#62; There were 1200 players online at once tonight; we got the message 
&#62; just before they shut down the servers for a 10 minute break.
&#62; 
&#62; My impressions of phase 2:  MUCH BETTER.  The game is actually 
&#62; playable now.  Still obviously BETA though.  I found a bunch of 
&#62; practice dummies, but couldn't swing at them.  Every time I tried to 
&#62; practice, I got the message, &#34;you have to wait until it stops 
&#62; swinging&#34;.  I guess the game thought I had already swung, and hit 
&#62; the dummy.  So, I wasn't able to get any practice that way.  I'm 
&#62; hoping that bug is corrected soon so I can build my strength and use 
&#62; the sword.  
&#62; 
&#62; I also saw a PC attack and kill another PC in town..... NO GUARDS 
&#62; showed up to save him!  So.... it looks like the NPC guards need 
&#62; tweaking a little, at least in Vesper.
&#62; 
&#62; Let me know if you folks want to hear more.  I plan to log back in 
&#62; early tomorrow.</pre>
