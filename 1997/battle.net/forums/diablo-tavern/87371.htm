<pre>Here's my schizophrenic response to cheating vs. PK'ing.

What drove me out of public games was cheating not PK'ing.
Especially when ghosts started showing up -- now of course
the ghosts PK'd you, but what was bad was that you had no
warning and no defense -- wham! all of a sudden you were
dead. The ghosts seem to be gone now, but when I do join
public games these days, it's pretty hard to find PK'ers,  although
there are always people with an ungodly number of hit points etc.

Of course, there's not much left for legit PK's to do these
days, since there's almost no-one left to kill in public
games -- legit PK's are like ecological activists that are
forced to eat Giant Pandas to survive.
Maybe there would be more PK'ing if public games were full
of legit players, like Code suggested.

But  I think Eugene's scenario is much closer to the truth than 
Code's.

Now, I don't think PKing is what Diablo should be about, and  the
PK'ers who get there jollies from MK'ing someone 208 times seem pretty
immature and sick to me. But Duping and Hacking has done much more
to ruin the game than PK'ing.

On the other hand, it's been fascinating to watch the evolution of 
b.net.
It has had some of the gruesome interest of watching a train wreck in 
slow motion.
Perhaps cheating and hacking has given a richer moral texture to a 
game
which could otherwise degenerate pretty quickly into a lot of mouse
clicking.</pre>
