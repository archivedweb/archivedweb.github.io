&#62; &#62; I am called Thunder God by the humans of this realm.  I have formed a 
&#62; &#62; small, yet growing, following of humans or near humans with a common 
&#62; &#62; goal...  to quell the insanity on Diablo's Battlenet.  In order to 
&#62; &#62; accomplish this, our Clan is made up of only the most dedicated 
&#62; &#62; players on Bnet.  If you think you have what it takes to be the best 
&#62; &#62; and want to help up stop all the unasked for pkilling and stealing,

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I also want it to be known that while our Clan does not condone 
&#62; &#62; cheating or cheaters in general, we also do not prohibit cheating.  
&#62; &#62; We believe that the choice to do so is solely up to the descretion of 
&#62; &#62; the player.  Check us out and tell me what you think.

&#62; Gee are you a clone of me. I know everybody wants to be like the 
&#62; Order of the Lost, but you don't have to plagerize me. Check the 
&#62; posts for this weekend...you dumbass
&#62; 
&#62; And for the rest of you, join the REAL anti-PK guild- The Order of 
&#62; the Lost 200 members strong and still growing
&#62; And ignore this lame ass thunder guy

i m not a member of this clan but i think the watchers is a quite 
honorable clan. as one of their member helped me out today, 
~gambit~(tw). i m the guild master of angels of hell, a noncheating 
guild, so i d have no conflict with the watchers. and i don't plan to 
have anything to do with them or order of the lost. i m not saying 
that the watchers is better than order of the lost, but give the 
watcher a chance, u might like it.

p.s. and if u r looking for a noncheating clan come visit
