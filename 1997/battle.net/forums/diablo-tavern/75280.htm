&#62; You know what, I'm impressed. Bob you sound like a smart guy, and yet 
&#62; I can't believe you would stick up for inferno. But you deserve 
&#62; answers to your quetions, and you will get them.
&#62; Your first and second questions tie together. The Order IS an anti-
&#62; PKer guild. We do kill PKers. We do not kill newbies or anyone else 
&#62; who is not a PKer. In order for us to come after you, you must be a 
&#62; known PKer. We just don't go in unknown games and start hacking away. 
&#62; We are not Inferno. Maybe that makes us feel better about ourselves. 
&#62; It puts us above random, low, kill anything with my level 38 mage as 
&#62; long as it's under 5th level, typical Inferno member.
&#62; Your 3rd question deals with cheating. How do we decide if they 
&#62; cheat? Very simple. it is called Diablo Eye. If I join you in a game 
&#62; and I know you are a PKer so I scan you first. If you have cheats or 
&#62; hacks running, I will know and I or someone else will return with 
&#62; full cheats running and destroy you. If no cheats are running, I will 
&#62; challenge you, and hope you don't run for momma. We don't &#34;Put 
&#62; Godmode on and go in chopping&#34; What about Godmode? It is not a 
&#62; problem. Ask Pain how well his Godmode worked when I caught his 22 
&#62; level warrior with Godmode on Mking 2 level 5 characters. He'll never 
&#62; forget it... As for a description of cheating, hacks, cheats, item 
&#62; dupes, they are all cheats. 
&#62; Your 4th question deals with the Order's new members. Would you like 
&#62; to know who our new members are. They are people who want to sign on 
&#62; to BNET and have fun but can't because everytime they join a game 
&#62; some 20th level character with 2000 hit points comes in the game and 
&#62; PK's them. They join because they want revenge. Very few of us 
&#62; actually hunt PK's. Most join for protection.
&#62; They like knowing if they are PKed there is someone waiting in our 
&#62; channel to avenge them.
&#62; I will duel you anytime. Without cheating. I am not afraid to lose. 
&#62; It happens in a legit game. And I enjoy those legit games. Too often 
&#62; I have to hunt cheating PKers, and that is too easy. A legit opponent 
&#62; is a rarity on BNET.
&#62; And lastly I apologize about the name thing. I was tired and sick of 
&#62; reading those feeble attempts at replying from those inferno jokers.
&#62; 
&#62; I'll be looking for you...

Ohh just be quite already you walking pile of trash ..If you really 
wanna fight me then come in and fight me...I'll be on under the name
MinionX(GR) come in and try to kill me if you like..IF i am in a pw
protected game then come to Inferno+ and wait for me...I usually only
spend a few minutes in there..and by the way I am not Inferno
So none of there rules affect me. =) So some in and kill me
I've killed many before and i will continue killing when you are 
long gone! SO let us make do with the battle.net ungodly person</pre>
