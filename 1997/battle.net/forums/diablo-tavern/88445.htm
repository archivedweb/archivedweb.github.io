<pre>Let me tell you my story on what happened when I bought Diablo.  In 
short, I bought it, installed it, and it wouldn't run.  My 1.6 GB 
hard drive was ... well, ... more than 90&#37; full and I suspected 
that I might not have enough virtual memory cache.  I also collect 
shareware programs from all over so I decided to add another hard 
drive to my system.

I installed a new 3.5 GB drive, partitioned it because Windows 95 
doesn't recognize anything larger than 2.something GB, re-installed 
Diablo on my new drive and moved some other programs over to free up 
space on the original drive.  It worked.  I could now play Diablo!!

A while later, I purchased some other games and started having 
similar problems.  I couldn't get some of the more memory intensive 
programs to run.  My solution was to reconfigure the virtual memory 
to use the small partition of my new hard drive (1.something GB!!!) 
as nothing but memory cache.  So far, it works.  all of the programs 
I have installed are now running.  And, if I run into a program that 
needs more cache than that, I'LL THRASH THIS COMPUTER TO A PULP!!! ** 
Just kidding, baby.  I won't hurt you.  Just keep running like a good 
girl.  :) **

If you're having problems, the solution may be as simple as clearing 
out some unused files to make more room for the memory cache.  It's 
an easy step to take that can have dramatic results.

How is any of this Bill Gate's fault?  Well, doesn't it seem that 
everything Microsoft does lately is done to suck up more memory?

Or maybe it's just my imagination.
