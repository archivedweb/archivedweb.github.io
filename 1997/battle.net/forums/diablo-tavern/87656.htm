<pre>OK...to start off with, my view of cheating is if it ENHANCES your 
player in anyway (ie actually modifies something) than was intended 
in the game, it is a cheat.  Since duped and hacked items weren't 
meant to be in the game, they were cheats. Also, if you use cheats to 
beat a restriction in a game (ie bans), then you are cheating.

&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; If you want to participate in this survey, please answer the 
&#62; questions *BEFORE* you read other peoples replies (in order to 
&#62; preserve answers). I want each of your opinions.
&#62;  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; This is a simple survey of what people consider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; is or is not, cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

Nope, but don't trust anyone you don't know REAL well (would someone 
REALLY give away a legit GPOW?)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?

If it is, then I'm a hardcore cheater :-)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

Nope, unless you use it before a duel to gain a tactical advantage

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

Not if its a legit staff or scroll

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

If you're refering to casting a portal on them in town,  yes, but if 
you're refering to a portal trap, no.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

This is an interesting one.  Since it can't really enhance your 
character, no, but if you use it to gain some kind of unfair 
advantage, yes.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

Nope

&#62; 
&#62; &#60;---!begin more questions---&#62;

OK
&#60;short cofee break&#62;

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change character names?

If you use it to avoid people (aka Bounty Hunters) yes.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Mkill someone?

Nope, unless you use cheats to do it.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change accts on battle.net

Since the only reason to do it is to avoid bounty hunters and beat 
bans, yes its cheating.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Transfer characters to another computer?

Nope

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Run Diablo off your hard drive?

Not cheating, but if you didn't buy the game, its illegal.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Use utilities that allow things such as Ghost 
&#62; See?

Nope, it merely re-balances the game so legits have a chance.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to use other chat utilities such as Diapolis? 
&#62; (ask a snakegod member what it is)

Nope

&#62; #). Is it cheating to transfer single player characters to 
&#62; multiplayer?


Yup

&#62; Answer honestly!

But honesty just isn't any fun...

&#62; **********************************************
&#62;  Original Survey posted by -=/ CodeMyster /=-
&#62;   I thought it would be nice to see answers
&#62;    from regular tavern-goers and such since
&#62; cheating is a big issue in the tavern nowadays
