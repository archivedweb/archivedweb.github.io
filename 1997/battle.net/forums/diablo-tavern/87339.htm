&#62; &#62; Yup. here it is. This post deals with several issues: Proving that 
&#62; &#62; TheMan is powerthirsty bastard, Proving that he is a coward, proving 
&#62; &#62; that he is a cheater and finally proving that he is a traitor.. but 
&#62; &#62; let us begin:
&#62; &#62; Why is TheMan powerthirsty bastard? Simple, because first thing he 
&#62; &#62; did when came back in Inferno is made himself and his lapdog Haplo 
&#62; &#62; TO's, I doubt there was ANY election of any kind whatsoever, anyway 
&#62; &#62; they both now TO and they made flux something like a bar maid and 
&#62; &#62; pretty much ready to kick her out... something REAL TO in OLD Inferno 
&#62; &#62; would NEVER do... All Theman ever wanted was an imaginatory power.... 
&#62; &#62; now he thinks he has it... I would love to hear from as many Inferno 
&#62; &#62; as possible HOW many of you really think TheMan and Haplo should lead 
&#62; &#62; Inferno... btw.. flux? I warned you what a piece of crap TheMan is..
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; TheMan is sure a coward... today he spent in chat nearly several 
&#62; &#62; hours chatting with his asskidders Tracy who wanted to duel (TheMan 
&#62; &#62; obviously had time) Was banned on sight.. I guess he doesn't like to 
&#62; &#62; be challenged....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Yes TheMan is a cheater! Player who has level 50 warrior and many 
&#62; &#62; level 40+ characters should of already know that Shields of harmony 
&#62; &#62; do not exist and that rings WERE NEVER POSSIBLE TO BUY in Multyplayer 
&#62; &#62; game... Yup.. today TheMan said that before you could buy a ring in 
&#62; &#62; multyplayer..... he he eh.. I was on B.net since day 1.... well.. 
&#62; &#62; things could be wrong when 0.00 version of Diablo was on.... 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Yes TheMan is a traitor.. flux got him back into Inferno and first 
&#62; &#62; thing TheMan does is kicking flux out... Flux? Didn't I tell you what 
&#62; &#62; a piece of crap he was? Didn't I tell you that ALL he wanted is to 
&#62; &#62; sit in chat and order his little doggies around? Yes.. all TheMan and 
&#62; &#62; Haplo can do is sit in chat and Ban... they both ARE complete 
&#62; &#62; losers...trust me on that one....
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Never wanted flux out...just wanted her to know she is NOT leader of 
&#62; INFERNO.
&#62; 
&#62; Two, Eugene, why does I.Loyola wear Obsidian Rings of the Zodiac?  
&#62; Duped ones, at that?
&#62; 
&#62; Still Level 49, Eugene...don't jump to my level before you actually 
&#62; PLAY the game (all you ever seem to do is chat, now, I might add)
&#62; 
&#62; I said today you could buy rings and amulets...in single player.  Of 
&#62; course, Lythe was a moron to, how should I say...not read the rest of 
&#62; it. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Face it, Eugene, you are a loser in a loser guild.  When UO comes 
&#62; out, you will be forgotten for important people, like Lord 
&#62; Blackthorne.
&#62; 
&#62; So, Eugene, face it, nothing you can conjure up inside your empty 
&#62; head can affect me.
&#62; 
&#62; I ban PoC from the channel, Period.  What are YOU going to do about 
&#62; it?
&#62; 
&#62; Flux has no right to make decicions without consulting the TO's, and 
&#62; she cannot do a damn thing right now.  So, flux, please stop trying 
&#62; to act like a leader.  That you are not.
&#62; 
&#62; Did I kick flux out of INFERNO?  Um...no...she is still around, I 
&#62; think...
&#62; 
&#62; Eugene, can you be...dare I say it....lying again?
&#62; 
&#62; Eugene, you are a little fish in a little pond...your color just 
&#62; makes you noticed more.
&#62; 
&#62; Take it easy, Eugene..when you were a threat you were fun to laugh at.

    This is actually in response to a message on down the board, but 
since it had 10 or so responses you probably wouldn't see it. You 
said you could see right through the kids. Don't you think you it's a 
bit childish getting into a game so much for someone as old as you? 
Now there's nothing wrong with older people playing games, I'm just 
saying the fights you get in look silly from the view of the public. 
Now I know you're smart, so you should change a little. I haven't 
ever seen you admit to being wrong for anything, either. Kind of 
egotistic of you. This isn't a &#34;Get a life&#34; message, I don't 
care if you post 10 messages a day, it's just the content of them 
that irks me. </pre>
