&#62; I'm proudly to announce that legit PKILLING is DEAD.
&#62; Now, you can't join any public game to kill people.  How nice! :)

I am proud to announce that legit Pkilling is dead...  1 error


&#62; Only way to pkilling is now DUEL.  Yup, your backstabbing days of 
&#62; pkilling has ended.  If you didn't notice, more than half of B.net 
&#62; citizens CHEAT.

Only way to PKILL now is duel. Yup, your backstabbing days of 
pkilling have ended. If you didn't notice, more then half of B.N 
citizents cheat .......... 2-3 errors (at least I think so)
&#62; 
&#62; Now, only way to pkill other is to use CHEAT.  
&#62; I don't belief that you can now actually kill more than 20 per day.

 I don't believe, that you can actually kill more then 20 per day now
.... 1 mistake at least.

&#62; With this kind of situation, you MUST cheat to kill.  Now, that make 
&#62; you a cheater.  

In this situation you must cheat to kill. Now that MAKES you a cheater
....1-2 errors
&#62; 
&#62; And also even if you are pkilled by cheaters, it is the same thing as 
&#62; you have been pkilled by legits.  No difference, result is that you 
&#62; die.  So don't blame cheaters, blame PKILLERS, Pkillers even include 
&#62; CHEATER-PKs.  So, if you've been pkilled, no pain, no gain.
&#62; 
Also if you were pkilled by cheaters, it's same thing with being 
pkilled by legits. No difference, result is your death. So don't 
blame cheaters, blame PKillers, pkillers including CHEATER-PK's. So 
if you have been PKed no pain no gain  ...... at least 4 mistakes in 
grammar style and such......

&#62; 
&#62; Balance of POWERs in B.net
&#62; 
&#62; Legit= less than 20&#37;
&#62; Cheaters= More than 80&#37;
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; CHEATERS ARE EVEN SUPERIOR IN NUMBERS!!! :(
Shouldn't it be :Cheaters are superior in number? 
&#62; WE CAN'T GO FIGHT THEM, HOW CAN WE FIGHT WHOM WE CAN'T HIT??
&#62; FORGET ABOUT LEGITIZING THE CHEATERS!
&#62; WE CAN'T WIN!!!  
&#62; 
&#62; S-R
&#62; 
&#62; p.s.  LEGIT pkilling days has ended, accept your destiny, it was 
&#62; forseen.  
I still think it should of been &#34;Days have ended&#34; Once again 
dear SR, I am NOT american, nor I am English, nor my language has any 
resemblance to English. Gramatical structures are very different. 
English belongs to germanic languages along with Dutch German and 
some others, while Russian is Slavonic language. However, during test 
essay  when I was applying in my University in Russia I had to write 
at least 5 page essay with 1 point erased for each mistake, 
regardless of kind of mistake. I wrote essay about Book,which 
included in Russian School program and is mandatory for reading in 
shool.(NO we do not have SAT or anything like that. We have final 
exams in shool and then u have to pass test in each university you 
wish u apply, ONLY test results define whenever you accpeted or not, 
no one cares what u have in shool) Anyway, I had 4 in my essay, which 
means that only ONE point had been taken out of 5 list essay. It 
gives us 1-2 mistakes for 5 pages (Usual time for essay given my any 
University admission office)Russia has different grading system by 
the way, highest grade is 5 whish is equal to &#34;A&#34;, then 4 
or&#34;B&#34; then 3 or &#34;C&#34; then 2 and 1 whch have no 
difference because either mean &#34;F&#34;.. however 1 means 
&#34;F&#34; with humiliation... he he he... I garade you 1 Sexy 
Rogue... and I would love YOU to post again that YOU speak better 
then me.... he he eh</pre>
