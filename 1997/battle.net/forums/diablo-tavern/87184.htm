&#62; BLZ, nothing you can say is going to make me let up.  NOTHING.
&#62; 
&#62; I duel LOTS, and if I don't want to duel a few cheaters and someone 
&#62; trying to say they beat me, then why not just mind your own business?
&#62; 
&#62; I mean, I don't hurt anyone, do I? (nevermind that one)
&#62; 
&#62; I pk, I duel, and when you see me in action, I am pretty damn good.  
&#62; Provoking me does nothing.  I deal with actual &#34;smart&#34; and 
&#62; &#34;important&#34; people in real life and I do quite well, in fact, 
&#62; I do damn well.
&#62; 
&#62; And through this anti-pk, anti-INFERNO, anti-TheMan stuff, I ALWAYS 
&#62; stay and hold my ground.
&#62; 
&#62; So, if you just cannot handle me attacking your precious guild of 
&#62; Quitters (By invitation only, I might add), then maybe you should 
&#62; quit posting on the forum.
&#62; 
&#62; You can try and tear ANYTHING I say apart, but it does no good.
&#62; 
&#62; No one can ever get rid of me.  Especially not a quitter's guild, a 
&#62; few cheaters who like to post, a guild of three friends who are a 
&#62; &#34;tad&#34; bit to close, if you know what I mean, lots of two-bit 
&#62; pks (SnowRabbit rings a bell), a cloning rocker name, a wise-ass fat 
&#62; kid, and someone who thinks they can post whatever they want and it 
&#62; is law.
&#62; 
&#62; When you guys get good, give me a call.  I guess I have some time, 
&#62; then. :)
&#62; 
&#62; And Silencer, Curunir, and all of the other associated ilk can flame 
&#62; me, spam me, and do whatever they want....I am not leaving.
&#62; 
&#62; Because if I actually CARED what you people said, I would maybe 
&#62; actually &#34;listen&#34; to you.  I don't.
&#62; 
&#62; BLZ, I like you, we had some fun times, so be smart, stay the hell 
&#62; out of my way.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;What can I say?  I'm a jerk.&#34;</pre>
