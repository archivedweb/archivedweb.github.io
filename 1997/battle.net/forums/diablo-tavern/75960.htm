&#62; Hi Stonehaven... How are you?
&#62; 
&#62;   As one of two representatives of barbarians here at Ogdens, [the 
&#62; other being a fellow going by the oddest name, Conan or something] I 
&#62; have to take exception to your slander.  Look below...
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;I've always said that humans were a waste of skin. Give 
&#62;  them a blade and what do they do? Hack up poor gentle 
&#62;  trees! Barbarians!!&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; You want to explain yourself buddy?  Us barbarians are much more 
&#62; likely to hack into a demon than a tree!  Those who have survived off 
&#62; the land learn to respect it.  It is the so called civilized people 
&#62; who have earned the great trees hatred!  I just couldn't stand by and 
&#62; let you speak that way about a group of people.  [Two is a group!]  I 
&#62; won't try and get you banned or anything, but watch it.  Next time 
&#62; try:
&#62; 
&#62;  destroyer, vandal, terrorist, savage, brute, ruffian, hoodlum, 
&#62; hooligan, fiend, monster.... 
&#62; 
&#62; but leave us barbarians out of it... unless its good of course.  I 
&#62; could have just let this go, but whaddya expect from a barbarian?!?
&#62; 
&#62; (ooc)
&#62; Well, I hope you took that in the fun sense it was intended.  I'm 
&#62; still enjoying your stories a lot, and still reading all of them all 
&#62; the way through.  Please continue, regardless of the time between 
&#62; posts.  Thanks for making the effort, and taking the time to share 
&#62; with us.

&#62; &#34;It's a darn good thing for you that us barbarians never invented 
&#62; lawyers!&#34;

	Wow. What did you do? Sit on your sword or something? You'll have to 
forgive me. I guess being stuck in that time portal (which actually 
turned out to be a lost South American jungle tribe who worships dust 
mites{you were right Morteleux. The time portal never existed}), 
impaired my judgement. My most humblest appolgy, oh great barbarious 
one (is barbarious a word? Oh, well. It is now!).
