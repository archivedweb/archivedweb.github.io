<pre>          Over the last couple of months I have learned the horrors 
of cheating in multi player games. I also have some ideas on why 
people do not see anything wrong with it.
     The Diablo that could of been is gone. The cheaters have seen to 
that. So now we must all deal with the Diablo that is. That Diablo is 
a place where honest trading is next to impossible in public, most 
people who wish to play legit have been driven like cattle into 
private games,not because of pks....but because of CHEATING pks with 
hacks and programs up the whazoo..... The joy of legit pking and 
therefore legit bounty hunting is dead. Yes you can still pk, but not 
like the old days.
     Everyday a new cheater is born on battle.net. Some are ignorrant 
of the fact that that new Dreamflange ring is a hack. Others are just 
arrogant and say &#34;I cheat the hell with you&#34;. The worst kind 
of cheater is the one who knows what he is doing is cheating, but 
denies that it is. You have all most likely met all of the three 
above types, if you play in public games.
     Most of the cheaters I talk to do not see anything wrong with 
what they are doing. They all have the same spiel.
    &#34;ALL games have cheats.&#34;
    &#34;Duping is a hidden cheat...not a bug.&#34;
    &#34;It's just a game I can do what I want.&#34;
    etc.....

    The thing these people do not understand is this. This is not you 
against the computer, alone in you room. It is you and a few thousand 
other people online playing in a real time game. If you cheat in a 
solo game you only affect yourself. When you cheat in a multi player 
game you affect everyone else. Cheat codes are built into games like 
doom. Often left over developer codes form the programmers, and more 
recently just built in cheat codes for people who can't handle the 
game even on the easiest setting. Why doen't Diablo have this? 
Becuase is a online multiplayer game. Anyone person who cheats has an 
effect on the whole of the game. The best example is the duping 
thing. Someone along time ago found a Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac. 
Now that person duped it for his friend. Who duped it for his 
friend..repeat ad infinitum.......and now every 9 out 10 folks on 
bnet use obsidian zod rings. I took this quote from a post below....
 

&#34;Uh oh, I used the 'up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, 
B,   A' cheat code in the NES version of Contra. I guess that means 
I'm    an honorless pig.
         Time for a reality check, people.&#34;

    This is a prime example of this mentallity. How do you even begin 
to compare using a cheat code in an old Nintendo game with cheating 
in an online multi player game like Diablo. You can't. It's like 
comparing sky-diving and knitting. 
    So, all you cheaters out there. I don't hate you. I am sure alot 
of you are nice people in RL. BUT, I hate the fact that you cheat.
Cheating has ruined what could of been for Bnet and led to what is.
It is still a freaking great game....but Bnet could have been so much 
more. Let hope Origin will try their best to minimize cheating in UO.
