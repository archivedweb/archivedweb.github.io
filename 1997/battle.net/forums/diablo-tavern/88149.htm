Ace,

I was getting page faults at one point.  You get a message like 
&#34;not enough memory to ... (whatever&#34; and then it boots you 
out of the game right?  And it always happens when you're going to 
another level or something.

Well, here's what The Helper told me to do for that.  Free up some hd 
space.  See, I only had 10 megs left out of 1G.   I freed up an extra 
70 and no more problems.

Oddly, at the same time I also got a corrupt save game file. 
(probably when I got dumped it didn't finish writing back to the game 
slot or something.  Anyway, before I got to The Helper, I did some 
stuff.  Mainly, I uninstalled Diablo. (but kept saved games).  Now 
one time I reinstalled it and started it up, went to multiplayer and 
it told me I had a corrupt save game file and it was fixing it.  I 
went on and all that happened was I lost all my equipment.  Yes, this 
was disappointing, but hey, a few days in hell can get that stuff 
back. (multiple games).  See, I had copied the multi .drv files to 
another directory.  So I de-installed again, then re-installed Diablo 
and the V1.04 patch BEFORE playing any games.  Now, I didn't know, 
and still don't know if somehow the patches affected the save games, 
but I copied my moved .drv files back to \windows, and started 'er 
up.  I got the same error, but get this, it corrected something 
different, and one of my other guys lost all of his equipment.

Anyway, it works fine now.  Verrrrrry weird.  So if you ever moved, 
renamed or touched those .drv files, bad move, i have no idea what it 
did, and have no need to find out.

Try making more room on your hd, or just start a new guy.

Hope something in there helps.

Find me as a Sorc: Lvl 37 Boush, or as a Rogue: Lvl 26 (I think), 
Axis.
