<pre>UO is going to rock!!!  it's sounding cooler by the day.  I wish i 
was on the beta,  U lucky SOB!!!  I think i'm going to be mage as u 
saidmages are cool and there are.  Magic is fun to use.  Every RPG i 
playi picked da mage.  In Daiblo i think the mage had to much power 
over the otherchars. but maybe thats just me(and some of the rogues i 
killed)Till laterSFOn Wed Jul 16 16:41, Tyrael (Mayhem) wrote:&#62; 
Well, I finally got my Cd today. I was happy.&#62; I then found out 
the full installation, the one to make it run like a &#62; beauty, 
takes approximately 420 megs. I was sad.&#62; So I had to look at my 
hard drive. I decided to screw that and &#62; install it on a 
mininmal setting. Can you say turtle with 3 limp &#62; legs? This is 
a great idea to upgrade your hard drive, I'm upgrading &#62; mine 
tomorrow.&#62; Well, I still had it installed and got to look at some 
of the &#62; features. First of all, the game took 3 hours to load 
becuase you are &#62; first required to download a million patches. 
That wasn't that bad. &#62; But then it said I couldn't play, cause 
it needs to be run in 16-&#62; color. I go ack. So I put it in High-
16 color. That kicks ass. So it &#62; finally ran. I got to watch the 
cool opening movie, but it's slooooow &#62; cause I'm running it off 
the Cd. Another reason of the update hard &#62; drive part. Now, dig 
this. It kept minimizing the window &#62; automatically. So, I had to 
go back to good old 640x400. God, &#62; everything is so big. The 
answer to this quandry, according to UO &#62; support, is to edit my 
Uo.cfg file. Umm, ya.&#62; Well, I still got to play character 
creation. Yes, that is fun. You &#62; can choose from multiple 
templates, like warrior, wizard, assassin, &#62; thief, bard etc. I 
chose the wizard template, cause magic is cool. &#62; When you choose 
the template, it automatically chooses your strength, &#62; magic and 
agility (I think that's it) and chooses your skills. You &#62; are 
able to still modify these thoughs. Among these attributes and &#62; 
skills, you get to distribute 100 points among the three in each 2 
&#62; things (skills and attributes). The attributes affect your hp, mp and 
&#62; stamina.&#62; 1 Strength - 1 Hit point&#62; 1 Magic    - 1 Magic 
point&#62; 1 Agility  - 1 Stamina&#62; For my guy, the template 
offered that it would be Strength 25, &#62; Agility 25 and Magic 50. 
I thought that sounded cool, so I agreed. On &#62; to my skills.&#62; 
For my skills, the offered were Inscription, Magery and Spell &#62; 
Resistance. I liked the first 2, but the Spell Resistance I thought I 
&#62; couldn't care less about. So I changed that to Tailoring, so I could 
&#62; dye myself some kick-ass clothing and make some money dyeing for 
&#62; others. I then split up 100 points by going 33, 34, 33. That way 
&#62; everything is nice and even.&#62; After that, you get to customize 
your character look. You can &#62; customize the following-&#62; The 
Name         - duh.&#62; Password         - Here you can password 
protect your character,      &#62;               keeping out your 
brother, father, sister,               &#62;      granddaughter, dog 
etc.&#62; Skin Tone        - Black, White, tanned, even make yourself 
look like &#62;                    a zombie.&#62; Hair color, type - 
You can adjust your color of hair, and the         &#62;            
hairstyle. The hairstyles go from bald to Afro.&#62; Facial hair      
- Type and Color. Goatee, moustache, beard etc.&#62; That's about as 
far as I got. After that, it would say it was trying &#62; to get me 
on the server, but nothing happens. Maybe too much traffic, &#62; I 
have no idea. I will try later tonight, and early tomorrow when the 
&#62; server traffic isn't as busy.&#62; Until then, I guess I'll be having 
fun playing Diablo. &#62; &#62; Take it easy,&#62; Tyrael&#62; I AM 
THE TIGER</pre>
