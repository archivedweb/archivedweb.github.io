&#62; As few of you know, me and IronFisT have built levels in a small, non-
&#62; cheating guild. Recently we were kicked out of it because we were pks 
&#62; in inferno-UO. Oddly enough, INFERNO has been asimalating pk guilds. 
&#62; Pirates of Dark Water, the non-cheating guild's afore mentioned UO 
&#62; guild, has been offered our alliance. 
&#62; 
&#62; SERIOUSLY, they aren't even pks. Their motto is &#34;you have to know 
&#62; someone to kill them&#34;. PLEASE people thats pathetic. Their 
&#62; &#34;Da Master Plan&#34; is to beat and bully NPCs. 
&#62; This is the kind guild we should kill not ally with. Their pathetic --
&#62;  at one point their Diablo version wanted to goto war with inferno 
&#62; (we chose inferno and we kicked out for it).
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Get back to me Tracy_lords, Prime, Fist, Pegleg, Snowrabbit, Morte, 
&#62; and other inferno leaders.
&#62; 
&#62; Metron
ohh did i mention that those guys just my ally w/ great coalition if 
we don't ally with them now?
ohh coalition is not very friendly..

WE HAVE TO ALLY WITH THEM CAUSE IT WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT THE INFERNO</pre>
