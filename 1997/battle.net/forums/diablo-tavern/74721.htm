<pre>...and the festivities, as usual, were second to none. There were 
musicians playing, people dancing, and the laugher of a thousand 
jokes echoed up and down the Hall. Ridcully stumbled about so 
inebriated he leaned on a golem to keep himself upright. There was 
Easy_Dreamer, who as usual was giving his best sly smile to every 
rogue that walked in the door; at the moment NiceAssets_:) seemed to 
have caught his attention for one reason or another. There was -
Ransyn- and Madelyn together in a corner, trying not to be noticed, 
but they fooled no one, especially Truthseeker who sulked as he 
watched them gaze at each other endlessly. Kairaega was loudly 
telling stories about the Clan of old, &#34;when there were only 5 
members&#34;, making sure the newer members understood who was 
&#34;third in command&#34;. Ramses just sat at the head of the Hall, 
gavel in hand, giggling at everything that transpired. The:Godly:Soul 
had let himself in somehow or another, and was doing his best to ruin 
the fun by complaining about the music or the ale or the company he 
was in. When he got too far out of line Ramses gave him the boot, but 
he always managed to sneak past Cohen and get in again. Eugene was 
there next to Cohen by the door, challenging anyone and everyone who 
came through it to a duel. All in all, it was a basic night of fun in 
the Snakegod Hall.

But on this night, off to the side sat Lepthana, alone with her 
thoughts. She sipped at a tankard of ale, but it brought her little 
comfort. Ever since Valaska had left, Ogden had been spending more of 
his time in the kitchen, less in the brewery, and the ale just hadn't 
been the same. Lept suspected that since the Snakegods had been 
ordering it in such bulk of late, that he had been watering it down 
some as well, but Ogden was too good a friend to lose by accusing him 
of that. She also noted with a little concern the continued absence 
of Salmissra from the parties. Running and maintaining an 
increasingly large clan was taking it's toll on the queen, she knew, 
and worried that perhaps the queen wasn't enjoying it so much 
anymore. But this concern was only on the fringes of her mind this 
evening.

Friday came over to try and cheer Lepthana up. 

&#34;What's the matter? Don't tell me those loonies over at Ordo have 
got you down. C'mon, let's go play some Pin-the-Arrow-on-the-
Barbarian. I bet I can hit him 3 times before you can do it 
once.&#34; Friday succeded in drawing a smile out of her. 

&#34;No thanks, Fri, I'm not feeling up to it. Get Mayaheine, she's 
been practicing, she might give you a run for your money.&#34; Friday 
didn't intend to give up so easily, but she could see that her friend 
wanted to be left alone. &#34;May!&#34;, she called across the hall...

Atropos suddenly appeared at the door with a hurried, worried look on 
his face. Cohen greeted him warmly and opened the door for him. He 
looked around the hall for a bit and then headed over to Lepthana and 
sat next to her.

&#34;Have you been in the library this whole time?&#34; she asked 
him. No one had seen him in the last day.

&#34;Yes. Lept, you should go there, and read what they-&#34;

&#34;I have&#34;, she interrupted. &#34;I read it long ago. I 
guess... I guess I've known this would come to pass all along.&#34; 
That thought was a hard one. If she had known it all along, why did 
it upset her so?

&#34;Have you talked to Salmissra about this?&#34; Atropos wanted to 
know.

&#34;No, it is not my place to do that. Frylia will; we should just 
keep it to ourselves until then.&#34; A long pause came between them. 
&#34;I wish I could be more optomistic about this...&#34;

&#34;You should be. It will be a difficult task indeed, but we can do 
it. The events as were written in the library are not set in stone. 
No one knows how this story will end yet.&#34;

&#34;You're right, I know...&#34;

&#34;Hey, listen, if you think things are tough for us, think about 
the Ordo. The sacrifices we must make are nothing compared to them. 
When this is all over, at the very worst we can ressurect each other 
and get on with our lives, but for them this could be the end. We 
must do this for their sake. For now we should just try to join the 
party and be merry while we can.&#34;

Lept nodded. But neither of them moved to join the festivities. She 
sat quietly and searched her soul for the haughty confidence she had 
always had until the previous night. And the party went on around 
her, her comrades unaware of the perils they would face in the days 
to come.</pre>
