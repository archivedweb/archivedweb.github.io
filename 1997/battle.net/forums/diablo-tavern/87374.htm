&#62; &#62; Yup. here it is. This post deals with several issues: Proving that 
&#62; &#62; TheMan is powerthirsty bastard, Proving that he is a coward, proving 
&#62; &#62; that he is a cheater and finally proving that he is a traitor.. but 
&#62; &#62; let us begin:
&#62; &#62; Why is TheMan powerthirsty bastard? Simple, because first thing he 
&#62; &#62; did when came back in Inferno is made himself and his lapdog Haplo 
&#62; &#62; TO's, I doubt there was ANY election of any kind whatsoever, anyway 
&#62; &#62; they both now TO and they made flux something like a bar maid and 
&#62; &#62; pretty much ready to kick her out... something REAL TO in OLD Inferno 
&#62; &#62; would NEVER do... All Theman ever wanted was an imaginatory power.... 
&#62; &#62; now he thinks he has it... I would love to hear from as many Inferno 
&#62; &#62; as possible HOW many of you really think TheMan and Haplo should lead 
&#62; &#62; Inferno... btw.. flux? I warned you what a piece of crap TheMan is..
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; TheMan is sure a coward... today he spent in chat nearly several 
&#62; &#62; hours chatting with his asskidders Tracy who wanted to duel (TheMan 
&#62; &#62; obviously had time) Was banned on sight.. I guess he doesn't like to 
&#62; &#62; be challenged....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Yes TheMan is a cheater! Player who has level 50 warrior and many 
&#62; &#62; level 40+ characters should of already know that Shields of harmony 
&#62; &#62; do not exist and that rings WERE NEVER POSSIBLE TO BUY in Multyplayer 
&#62; &#62; game... Yup.. today TheMan said that before you could buy a ring in 
&#62; &#62; multyplayer..... he he eh.. I was on B.net since day 1.... well.. 
&#62; &#62; things could be wrong when 0.00 version of Diablo was on.... 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Yes TheMan is a traitor.. flux got him back into Inferno and first 
&#62; &#62; thing TheMan does is kicking flux out... Flux? Didn't I tell you what 
&#62; &#62; a piece of crap he was? Didn't I tell you that ALL he wanted is to 
&#62; &#62; sit in chat and order his little doggies around? Yes.. all TheMan and 
&#62; &#62; Haplo can do is sit in chat and Ban... they both ARE complete 
&#62; &#62; losers...trust me on that one....
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Never wanted flux out...just wanted her to know she is NOT leader of 
&#62; INFERNO.
&#62; 
&#62; Two, Eugene, why does I.Loyola wear Obsidian Rings of the Zodiac?  
&#62; Duped ones, at that?
&#62; 
&#62; Still Level 49, Eugene...don't jump to my level before you actually 
&#62; PLAY the game (all you ever seem to do is chat, now, I might add)
&#62; 
&#62; I said today you could buy rings and amulets...in single player.  Of 
&#62; course, Lythe was a moron to, how should I say...not read the rest of 
&#62; it. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Face it, Eugene, you are a loser in a loser guild.  When UO comes 
&#62; out, you will be forgotten for important people, like Lord 
&#62; Blackthorne.
&#62; 
&#62; So, Eugene, face it, nothing you can conjure up inside your empty 
&#62; head can affect me.
&#62; 
&#62; I ban PoC from the channel, Period.  What are YOU going to do about 
&#62; it?
&#62; 
&#62; Flux has no right to make decicions without consulting the TO's, and 
&#62; she cannot do a damn thing right now.  So, flux, please stop trying 
&#62; to act like a leader.  That you are not.
&#62; 
&#62; Did I kick flux out of INFERNO?  Um...no...she is still around, I 
&#62; think...
&#62; 
&#62; Eugene, can you be...dare I say it....lying again?
&#62; 
&#62; Eugene, you are a little fish in a little pond...your color just 
&#62; makes you noticed more.
&#62; 
&#62; Take it easy, Eugene..when you were a threat you were fun to laugh at.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)

&#34;Eugene, you are just a little fish in a little pond?&#34;  Are 
you in 2nd or 3rd grade English?  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know you 
didn't graduate pre-school.  Like I said in my previous messages, GET 
A BRAIN!!!  I believe the correct phrase is, you are a little fish in 
a BIG pond.  So go jerk off.  That's probably what you do best 
besides cheating.</pre>
