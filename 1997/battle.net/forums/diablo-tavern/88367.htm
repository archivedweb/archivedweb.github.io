&#62; Upon arriving back in town, Pepin is nearly attacked by 
&#62; Warriors, Rogues, and Wizards alike. Some of them were lying 
&#62; on the ground, pools of blood surrounding them. The dead and 
&#62; the dying were everywhere. &#34;Please.. You have to help my 
&#62; friend.&#34;, begs one warrior. His friend lying on the ground 
&#62; unconscious, severely bleeding from an open wound in his 
&#62; chest. Pepin, turning away with tears streaming down his face, 
&#62; &#34;I'm sorry, my friends, I can no longer heal you.&#34;
&#62; &#34;What do you MEAN you can no longer heal us?&#34; The Warrior 
&#62; stands up, shouting. &#34;How can you refuse to heal my friend?&#34;
&#62; &#34;LOOK at him. Only YOUR healing can save him. You MUST 
&#62; save him!&#34;
&#62; &#34;I'm not refusing to heal. I CAN&#34;T heal anymore&#34; Pepin 
&#62; shouts 
&#62; back. &#34;I've lost my ability to heal people.&#34;
&#62; Pepin turns away and walks back to his hut, head bowed down 
&#62; and unable to control his emotions any longer.
&#62; &#34;It's true, you know, he really can't heal your friend. Or anyone 
&#62; else, for that matter.&#34; Looking sympathetically at the Warrior. 
&#62; &#34;I'm sorry about your friend. I really am. But have you noticed 
&#62; something's different? None of Pepin's magic works anymore. 
&#62; And Adria's dead.&#34; There was stunned silence at this remark. 
&#62; &#34;Someone killed her and stole her heart, literally. Pepin can't 
&#62; even resurrect her.&#34;
&#62; &#34;What do you mean Adria's dead?&#34; Several people almost 
&#62; shout in unison. &#34;She can't be dead.&#34; A mage continues. 
&#62; &#34;I mean, I just saw her not more than 20 minutes ago, very 
&#62; much alive. I bought this staff from her.&#34; The mage hands me 
&#62; the staff. Upon closer examination, I recognize this staff as a 
&#62; Plentiful Staff of Fireball. Looking at the runes on the staff, I 
&#62; notice they still appear to be active. &#34;Stand back. Everyone
&#62; please stand back for a moment.&#34;  Raising the staff, saying the
&#62; activation word for the staff. A huge ball of flame erupts from 
&#62; the staff shooting into the sky.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS DEVICE OF YOURS CAN'T BLOCK 
&#62; THE MAGIC INSCRIBED INTO STAVES?&#34; Roars Diablo. 
&#62; &#34;I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WILL DISRUPT ALL MAGIC.&#34;
&#62; &#34;Umm.. Well.. My Lord, I meant it as a figure of speech.&#34; 
&#62;  &#34;A FIGURE OF SPEECH&#34; shrieks Diablo. 
&#62; &#34;I WANT ALL MAGIC TO STOP WORKING... NOW!&#34; 
&#62; &#34;I will see what I can do my Lord.&#34; 
&#62; &#34;YOU WILL DO IT OR YOU WILL FEED MY HOUNDS.&#34;
&#62; &#34;GET OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I RIP YOUR HEART OUT. GO!&#34; 
&#62; Diablo's slave slowly slips out of the room wondering how he
&#62; was going to get magic to stop working with that magical 
&#62; faery wood.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Well here's part 2. Tell me what you think
