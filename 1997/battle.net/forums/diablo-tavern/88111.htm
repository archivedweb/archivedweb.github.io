&#62; Most of you may recognise at least one of my names; Wiseman. Many of 
&#62; you, of course, may not. Of course, we can forget the name thing. It 
&#62; does not really matter who I am, or indeed who any of us are. Well, 
&#62; it seems that way. Just a warning - anyone who'll be offended if this 
&#62; post isn't really about Diablo better leave now.
&#62; 
&#62; Has anyone else ever looked around them while driving through town, 
&#62; and seen all the advertising that surrounds us? Has anyone ever 
&#62; thought about how much money is spent to ensure that we buy one brand 
&#62; of soft drink over another? And how comparitively little we spend on 
&#62; education, health care and social security? How much is spent 
&#62; researching better ways to kill ourselves?
&#62; 
&#62; Why are there great and powerful empires built around things that 
&#62; really dont matter? Has anyone looked at the number of cars passing 
&#62; on the street and thought about exactly how much of the worlds 
&#62; resources are being wasted on transport? And of course, the 
&#62; multinational corporations who strive to ensure that we continue to 
&#62; do so, because it is their income at stake?
&#62; 
&#62; Am I the only person out of all the people I know that worries about 
&#62; the world and the direction the human race is heading? How can I 
&#62; presume to say it? What gives me the right to speak?
&#62; 
&#62; I feel like I am standing at the bottom of an enormous hole, and Im 
&#62; being told that the sun is shining and its a wonderful day. I step 
&#62; back and take an objective look at the world, and see that we are 
&#62; going to hell. Mankind has ceased to care about each other, and 
&#62; ceased to care about our environment. We choose to escape from our 
&#62; responsibilities by watching television, or spending endless hours 
&#62; attempting to realign electrons in our character information files, 
&#62; trying to prove our worth by attaining something that does not really 
&#62; exist.
&#62; 
&#62; People who think like this can have all their problems solved, and it 
&#62; is so easy. You can go to someone, and they will tell you that you 
&#62; dont need to worry about it - that it isnt your problem. Get some 
&#62; rest, take two of these and call me in the morning. And thatll be 
&#62; fifty dollars please.
&#62; 
&#62; I have a question though. If it isnt our problem, then whose problem 
&#62; is it?
&#62; 
&#62; I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this world, 
&#62; you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way to this 
&#62; point. I suppose you are reading this because you logged on today, 
&#62; looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to have 
&#62; disappointed you.
&#62; 
&#62; You know what the funniest thing is? I am going to finish writing 
&#62; this message, and post it up here, and go home tonight, and waste 
&#62; another hour or two of my four score years on realigning electrons in 
&#62; my character file. Because while I may be concerned, society has 
&#62; taught me I can do nothing about it. Im only twenty, after all. And 
&#62; that makes me a hypocrite in your eyes, because I whine about a 
&#62; problem and then choose to ignore it - and so then, once I am safely 
&#62; classified in your mind as someone not to listen to, youll ignore it 
&#62; too, and scroll on to the next post. And well all be happy.
&#62; 
&#62; Just a thought. It wont actually achieve anything except to make me 
&#62; feel a little better, but I would appreciate it; if you read this 
&#62; entire message, and thought even for a moment about anything I have 
&#62; said - waste a post on replying. Lets see who cares.
&#62; 
&#62;

&#62; Wiseman.


Wow is all I have to say Wiseman.  Ever since our first meeting I 
knew that you were one of the finest thinkers and writers that Ordo 
had to offer, and this post proves that.  I hate to let you down and 
tell you that I don't care about these things....but in a way I 
don't.  Sure I'm disgusted by the lack of interest in the important 
things in life by the Corporations, sure it makes me sick that we 
spend our money and time so frivolously, and of course it's saddening 
the state of education and relief in this world.  But to dwell on it 
can only ruin you.  I personally am not in a position to make much of 
a difference, I have a familly to feed, a mortgage, etc....but what I 
can do, I do.  I volunteer during the holidays, visit the comunity 
center every once in a while, dontate all my old clothes to 
goodwill....etc.  It's these small things that stem the tide of 
madness that thinking about those evils brings.  It's my 2 cents 
Mathew, and it may make me sound like a hypocrite, but don't think 
about it too much, you'll go mad.  Hey....have a Coke and a smile, 
and everything will be much better  :)
