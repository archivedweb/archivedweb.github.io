<pre>Here it is again....

Look flux...  I was nice, I was nice to you, I was nice to PoC.  But 
you know, for a woman, you have alot of balls.  Your doing things, 
that god said you shouldnt be doing.  Flux, your so full of it, its 
flowing out of your eye sockets.  Now, I know people are gonna say, 
&#34;Hey, why is flux, saying shit like she is running Inferno?&#34;  
And frankly flux, I dont like that one bit.

Now...  You and pyro, met in a game, and started discussing things, 
behind the backs of the TO's.  Tisk tisk tisk, very bad girl.  Flux, 
you see.  You are the advisor, not the leader.  Lets compare and 
contrast shall we?

Advisor:  ADVISES the TO on whether things should be in their best 
interests.
Leader:  TELLS the TO's that it IS their best interests.

You arnt the leader.  And I am putting you in your place RIGHT now 
flux.  If you dont cut this _ _ _ _ out.  Start crawling to Hysteria, 
or PoC, cause if your gonna start causing dissention in the ranks.  
We dont want you in our federation.

It seems to me, that Sarco did basicly the same thing your doing.  Is 
that simply coincidental, or...  Never mind.  Just a thought.  Back 
to what I was saying.  Dont put your head above ours Tracy, cause Ill 
push it right back down to where it belongs.  And you know I will, 
cause there is a nova with your name on it flux.  And NO, I do not 
use that auto-kill shit, and NO I was not kicked out of Inferno for 
cheating, I quit.  BECAUSE, I didnt like the way people were treating 
my friend, and now that I have some backup in this situation, I can 
take a stand, and I can say, &#34;HEY!!  You cant do that.&#34;  Not, 
&#34;If you do that, Im quitting.&#34;  Just like Fist and Tracy did 
when they were confronted with TheMan.  Fist and Tracy said to 
PegLeg,&#34;If you let TheMan back into Inferno, WE QUIT!!&#34;  Well 
it turns out the Quitters of Chaos quit anyway.  But that is beside 
the point.  Im getting a lot of $h*t off my chest in this post, but 
the most important thing to remember flux.  Is that you are not 
leading, you are following.  You are following me, Wager, and Kharn.  
Why?  You ask.  Cause thats why god put you here flux.  To follow!

                            Haplo (Inferno TO, and proud of it)

&#34;Wisdom is earned...not given.&#34;</pre>
