<pre>I dont recall saying anything that was increadibly offensive. I don't 
recall saying anything against Blizzard. However it appears as though 
those at Blizzard have different ideas about that since my posts and 
even my responses to posts seem to be dissapearing.

If Blizz.Sup is bothering to read this I would apreciate some kind of 
explanation as to why I qualified for this action. At least that way 
I can alert others to the danger.

I have always enjoyed this board and I think I added to the enjoyment 
for others. 

Anyway, I would like to know why, and how this is possible. 

See ya all soon, or maybe not?






       Cuda       O;)

PS: To anyone reading this (before it disapears of course) shoot off 
a post about it and see how many posts they will wipe out. Unless you 
fear being banned, then I will understand, of course.</pre>
