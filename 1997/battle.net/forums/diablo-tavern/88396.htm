<pre>Well You can't say that I didn't try. As I stated before... 

&#34;We have to be close friends who look out for each other because 
we are all linked to the federation through our friends... when we 
don't have many firneds left in the federation... the link 
weakens&#34;

     With TM, Tyrael, One-eyed-bob, LLL, Haplo, Acidic, Syxx, Tal, 
A.K.Legacy etc etc etc... who were all great frineds either left or 
where were kicked out of INFERNO, I became a weak link in the INFERNO 
chain. I couldn't continue anymore.

          I do not want to state every reason that I left because I 
don't want any hard feelings. 

       As for INFERNO.... it's become more then just a federation... 
it's become a legacy! INFERNO will never die.... it has become a 
member of it's own and will never cease to exist. Even if INFERNO 
isn't filled with members... it will always be filled with the pride 
and joy that we felt for it and will continue to feel for it. One day 
we will look back at INFERNO and remember the good old days. 

       During this whole thing... a man and I became close friends... 
we talked alot and he supported me when I was sad. Just when I 
thought I was down and out, I could always count on him to be there 
for me.

       Thankyou nIGHT. I will never forget your help and I look 
forward to many fun games with you and the whole Tarot guild. 

      nIGHT offered me a postion in Tarot UO.. he offered me the Ace 
of Coins. I thought it over and now I have accepted his offer and I 
am now a proud member of Tarot UO.
Later,

LowRider

&#34;It is wrong for one man to endure so much... and then have to 
sacrifice even more. I endured the pain of INFERNO. As the members 
left.. I felt as if a piece of me was leaving too. Then my friends 
where banned or moved on and so I suffered yet another loss. In the 
end I made the ultimate sacrifice.... I sacrificed my membership to 
INFERNO. What needed to be done... has been done. But Fate has 
prevailed once more and I find myself surrounded by new friends... by 
Tarot&#34;</pre>
