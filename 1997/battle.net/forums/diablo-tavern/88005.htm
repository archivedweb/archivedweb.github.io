&#62; Of Beginnings
&#62; Part One
&#62; 
&#62; 	But Father-
&#62; 	Dont you But Father me, Oltor! I fathered you to be a warrior, 
&#62; not a scribe! 
&#62; 	Oltor NaFessa looked down at his delicate, long-fingered hands. He 
&#62; was a gangly youth, and the dark skin was smooth and hairless, 
&#62; enhancing the appearance of fragility. He sighed. He had tried to 
&#62; explain that he may have been fathered to be a warrior, but he was 
&#62; not born to be one.
&#62; 	Unfortunately, this did not agree with his fathers plans to climb 
&#62; the social ladder. Already a merchant of great wealth, Thrak NaFessa 
&#62; was still shunned by the court for his lack of status. Oltor was the 
&#62; only child to be born of his loins in two score years, and his father 
&#62; was not about to pass up the chance to further his own designs. 
&#62; Warrior sons brought much respect and status.
&#62; 	Beginning tomorrow, you will train under the White Devil - he is 
&#62; the premier gladiator of the arena, and I have accrued much status by 
&#62; means of his purchase. (It went without saying that the gladiator 
&#62; was a slave - who would willingly risk his life for the crowd?)
&#62; 	Oltor sighed under his breath. It was no use arguing.
&#62; 	As you wish, Father. his head bowed submissively.
&#62; 	As it should be. Thraks features relaxed into what would have 
&#62; been a smile on any well-favoured face, and he clapped a thick hand 
&#62; to his sons shoulder, staggering him. The heavyset merchant turned 
&#62; and strode from the ascetic chamber that served as his sons only 
&#62; room.
&#62; 	Familiar feelings washed over the young man - guilt, frustration, 
&#62; loneliness. They came to him comfortingly, like old friends. A single 
&#62; bitter tear rose hesitantly in one eye, before being blinked away 
&#62; angrily. He felt that something was wrong with his family - some 
&#62; fundamental flaw that must explain all the tension and heartache. But 
&#62; for the life of him, he could not think what it might be.
&#62; 	He turned from the door and his fathers retreating form, seeking 
&#62; solace in the only place he knew - between the heavy parchment pages 
&#62; of one of his prized books.
&#62; 
&#62; 	It was only a few weeks ago that he had stumbled across the first 
&#62; tome, while browsing through the shelves of an ancient shop he had 
&#62; discovered. A brief haggle, and the book was his for a paltry sum. 
&#62; Careful not to let his father find it, he had smuggled it home.
&#62; 	Late that evening, by the light of a guttering candle, he read the 
&#62; last few words on the final page, and closed the mottled cover. His 
&#62; eyes bright with wonder and glazed with weariness, he pondered the 
&#62; meaning of the ancient text. It spoke of powers beyond those of 
&#62; mortal men. Of magic arts, the power of the mind, and of the very 
&#62; stuff of life - Mana.
&#62; 	From that day onward, he had sought and obtained several archaic 
&#62; volumes of eldritch lore - many things he learnt about the 
&#62; disciplines and arts. His most recent purchase - of that very day - 
&#62; was a slim tome, bound in red leather. His fingers tingled as he 
&#62; touched the cover, and he knew that at last he had found his first 
&#62; spellbook.
&#62; 
&#62; 	He had barely a chance to hide his new discovery upon his return 
&#62; before being confronted by his father. And now it seemed that he 
&#62; would never have the freedom to study his newfound passion. His 
&#62; father had ruled that he would be a warrior, and he knew that he 
&#62; would not be able to sway him.
&#62; 	Well, for this one night he would do as he pleased.
&#62; 	He placed the book reverently upon his desk, and lit several of the 
&#62; fat candles that were placed advantageously about the room. Returning 
&#62; to his chair, he seated himself and drew the tome before him. The 
&#62; welcoming feel of the soft leather caressed his fingertips, bringing 
&#62; them alive with the feel of magic.
&#62; 	Breathing in deeply, he focused inwards as he had learnt, bringing 
&#62; his concentration to a peak. He let go of his fear of the morrow, and 
&#62; his despite of the warrior life that he was to begin. Slowly opening 
&#62; his eyes, he looked down, and opened the book. He read the first 
&#62; words of the ancient Horadrim book, translating them as he read...
&#62; 	Aye treatise upon the proper casting of the spell known as 
&#62; Firebolt...</pre>
