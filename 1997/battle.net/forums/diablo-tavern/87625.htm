&#62; I haven't been playing diablo for the past 2 months and I don't think

&#62; old player please leave a message here so I'll look for you...

Yes there are many oldtimers still here.  I myself have been playing 
since mid-January.  My first char name was Pervom a warrior who is 
lvl 38.  ALLAH is lvl 35 mage and was created when I joined the 
Snakegod clan.  Many of the oldtimers I believe have either joined 
guilds or have a close group of friends to play with.  That is why I 
am still playing because I joined a guild.  It allows one to escape 
from the cheaters of public games and at the same time give you many 
people to play with.  However, now it seems like I chat about the 
same amount as  I play since I have many people who I am friends with 
thanks to the Snakegod clan.  So if you are interested in coming back 
and playing Diablo and reexperiencing the fun you once had, drop by 
the Snakegod channel and look for me.  Ill adventure with you and I 
ma sure others will as well.  One last thing is that the Snakegod 
clan is a noncheating Co-op clan.  If you want to start a new char 
there are many people within Snakegod that have new chars that you 
can adventure with as well.  You can still enjoy the game as it was 
meant just join up with a guild or clan.  If Snakegod doesnt fit your 
fancy there are others out there as well that will offer the same 
benefits.  Many old timers can be found here at the Snakegod clan as 
well. Hope to see you back on.
