<pre>   hello,
 I have come to know alot of the folks in Snakegod over the past 
month. Since the OP's came to be, my regular resting spot, the Inferno
chat, had gone to the idiots who have no life and live to take over
a chat room in a game. Anyway, they have treated me as a friend. I am
thankful for that.
  BUT, I have know Tracy for quite sometime. He may be a truly evil 
bastard, but he does not lie. Shaft6, I will believe him over you. 
  Shaft6. Yes Tracy used a truly devious method to kill you. That is 
what she does. She's a PK. You talk about honor. She is not bound by 
any honor when it comes to getting her prey. Other than doing it 
purely legit. It is not cheating to build someones friendship and 
then stab them in the back. It is simply the most effective way to 
get a kill on someone who would not normally play with you. It seems 
that Tracy really wanted to get someone bigger anyway and eventually 
did.
(Lept...well like you said..you WILL be more carefull from now on.)
  The point here is I have to believe Tracy. I am sorry if this will
scratch any Snakes the wrong way, but it's just how I see it.
  Last. Shaft6. Backup for ANY reason other than a complete system 
crash which erases you character info, is cheating in my mind. This
happened to me 5 times(damn registry!) and still don't backup. Every 
time I just went out and found even better stuff.
