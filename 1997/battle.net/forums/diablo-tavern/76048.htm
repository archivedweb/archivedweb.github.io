<pre>Kai, these things you talk of,

&#62; any ob of zod jewelry
&#62; any godly plate
&#62; godly helm of whale
&#62; KSOH,KSOB,KSOV,KSOS
&#62; 
&#62; i've never seen themm....is it possible?
&#62; 

are really not all that rare, except for maybe the obs zods. Never 
come across one of those myself. Wirt actually was selling me a Godly 
Plate one day... too bad it was breast plate version =(. I've seen 
him sell plenty of godly mails and armors, including a godly cape of 
the whale. And I'm starting to thing that whale helms aren't really 
that rare at all... I had a godly crown of the whale that Salmissra 
bought from wirt for me once, and I've seen Wirt selling Godly cap of 
the whale, and helm of the whale plenty of times. I've found one each 
of a KSOB and a KSOV- the former I found in normal/hell when I was 
only level 25 or so, and the latter I bought from Gris. I think the 
KSOB was a long sword and the KSOV was a broad sword. 

The whole thing about Shaft is upsetting, needless to say, but let's 
not overreact. All we have is Tracy's word against his. They both say 
they should be taken at their word, and yet their stories are 
completely conflicting. For me, the jury is still out until more 
evidence can be presented one way or the other.

Y'know, it kinda saddens me that cheating has come to this. Pointing 
fingers and accusing one another, I mean. We, the noncheaters of 
b.net, should be united against the scourge of cheating, and yet it 
continues to divide us. But I guess that's the way it must be, for 
there's no real way of proving these things one way or another. 

Lept
&#34;I, too, remember the days before cheating... barely...
