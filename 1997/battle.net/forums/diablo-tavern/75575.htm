<pre>Hello everybody!

Sorry part 5 took so long, but I've had lots of work at work lately...
hehehe.  Actually, I still do, and so this part won't be as long as
I had intended.  Well, hopefully, I will have more time soon...

Ok, here is part 5...  The previous 4 part smay be found at the
Tales of Tristam Library at:
<a href="http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm">http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm</a>

Hope you like it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 5

They were greeted by cool air and a smell of incense.  As they walked 
inside Davion halted and looked about in wonder.  He had never seen a 
place this beautiful.  This chamber was huge!  First thing he noticed 
was the ceiling.  It loomed high above him and there was a painting 
on it that depicted a huge battle.  On the painting he could see 
hundreds of figures, angels and demons, fighting eachother.  He 
couldn’t understand how someone managed to paint it there!  It was so 
high up and encompassed the entire ceiling!  Then Davion looked 
around and noticed that the chamber was long and somewhat narrow.  
Large widows with colored glass let plenty of light in and Davion 
took a moment to admire the beautiful scene.  They resumed walking 
and headed forward, towards an altar.  As they were approaching the 
altar Davion gaped in wonder at the beautiful sculptures of angels 
and fallen demons that adorned the walls.   

They soon reached the altar and Davion’s mother called to a boy who 
was tending it.  He came to them briskly, and she asked him if she 
could speak to a priest.  She said that it’s about her son Davion 
joining the order...  The boy said that he is a priest, but in this 
situation Davion and his mother need to talk to the high priestess.  
While the boy and his mother were talking, Davion stared at the huge 
statue of an angel that stood above the altar.  It was amazing.  
Davion has never seen an angel before, but he could believe that it 
was a real one, standing still.  It was beautiful.  It held a large 
Broadsword just above it’s head, pointing it straight towards the 
ceiling, with it’s wings stretched out, encompassing most of the 
front wall.  He snapped out of his thoughts when his mother tugged 
him to move.

They followed the boy into a medium size room, where he asked them to 
sit down and wait.  He then left through another door.  As they sat 
there, waiting, Davion and his mother curiously looked around the 
room, intrigued by all sorts of religious items strewn about.  A few 
minutes later the door opened again and the same boy came together 
with an woman.  The woman introduced herself as Na’hni, High 
Priestess of the Temple of Tyrael while the boy went back into the 
main chamber.  Na’hni then walked up to Davion, stopped,  and peered 
into his eyes.  Davion’s face turned red as he suddenly felt as if he 
carried a lot of weight.  After what seemed to Davion a long, long 
time, Na’hni turned away and stood still.  She then asked him to wait 
outside while she has a talk with his mother.

After Davion left the room, Na’hni turned back and spoke to his 
mother:  &#34;He has a great fear and hatred of evil.  What happened 
to him?&#34;  Understanding dawned on Na’hni’s face as Davion’s 
mother described the events that took place in Tristam barely a week 
ago.   After her tale was done, Eleen (Davion’s mother) said that her 
son wanted to join the Guards to become a warrior, but she wouldn’t 
let him.  Instead, she thought that he would be happy here, in this 
great temple.  Na’hni was silent.  She was lost in thoughts, 
considering what she just saw and heard.  She knew that there was 
more to this boy than met the eye.  For some reason, she recognized 
him.  To Eleen, she then said:  We will take him into the order.  
However, to cover our expenses and to support the church, we request 
and require a fee of 50 gold pieces per month.  This fee will be 
canceled if your son proves himself.

Eleen breathed a sigh of relief.  They accepted her son into the 
order and even the fee wasn’t that big.  She could now rest, knowing 
that Davion was in good hands.  She was also proud of her son.  Being 
accepted into this Temple was an honor and it’s members were looked 
at with reverence.  She followed Na’hni out of the room and into the 
main chamber.  She saw Davion staring at Tyrael’s statue.  Eleen 
smiled to herself.  She too loved to stare at it when she was small.



I know, I know.  Bad place to break, but I had to go back to work...
As always, all comments are very welcome.
