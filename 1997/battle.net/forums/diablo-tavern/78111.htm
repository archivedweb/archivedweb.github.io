<pre>Greetings fellow drunken tavern patrons, :-)

Well well well when you come down out of your holes to the tavern 
expect the latest sensation CohenBarbarian and the Royale Snakegod 
Band over in Ogdens Tavern belting out the fastest rising hit on 
Khanduras Billboard charts... just look for the guy in the immense 
shoulder pads, and the rogue who happens to be dancing on the table 
next to him and thats Cohen, the rogue?? thats Iris but we dont like 
to brag about her.  So if Cohens not performing?? Not to worry, just 
buy him a round something and make it snappy and then he'll be glad 
to perform, and as an added bonus he may even get Iris to do some 
table dancing....

so without further ado here ya go currently number 9 on the Khanduras 
Billboard Charts-

The Diablo Anthem or Spammers in the Hall

&#60;&#60;sung to the tune of Flowers on the Wall by the Statler 
Brothers&#62;&#62;

uno, dos, tres, one, two, three, quatro!!!

Diablo, Diablo now!!!  Here we go, here we go!! yaahhhh!! wully 
bully!!


I keep hearing your concerns about my happiness, but all the thought 
your giving me is concious I guess.  If I were in your shoes I 
wouldnt worry none, cause while you and your guildsmen are worrying 
about me i'm having lots of fun...

Counting spammers in the hall, that don't bother me at all, playing 
Diablo til the break of dawn, with a dex of 51.  Smoking cigerettes, 
and watching my maaana go 'poof' now don't tell me I have nothing to 
do...

Last night I dressed in mail, pretended I was on the prowl, as long 
as I can dream that its hard to slow this adventurer down.  So please 
dont give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine.  You can always 
find me here in Snakegod and having quite the time...

do...

Its good to see you, but I must go I know I look affront.  Anyways my 
eyes are not accoustemed to this light, and my boots are not 
acoustumed to this hard concrete, so I must go back to my room and 
make my day complete..
