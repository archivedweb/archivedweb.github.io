<pre>Well, this is the story so far (lost 2 parts to it, the last 2 posts)
so, here we go

Walking down the deserted alley, Rakoth felt uneasy. It's too
quiet here, he thought. Can't even hear rats moving about.
Out of the corner of his eye, something moves. Turning his
head sharply to see what it might be, nothing is there. he
feels a tingling sensation in his spine. Something isn't right.
In fact, something is very wrong. Twirling around to see if
anything might be sneaking up behind him, nothing again.
A sense of foreboding creeps into him, his nerves on fire.
Movement again. Quickly turning, nothing there again.
Something is stalking me, scanning the shadows carefully
as to not miss anything. A sound...

&#34;Thump, thump&#34;, arrows fly from behind at an alarming speed,
they quickly find their resting place in his back.  Rakoth spins
around trying to see where they came from but it was too late.  Blood
flows down to his eyes, his view turns red then black.  Shaking with
anticipation, a rogue walks towards the body, a twisted snicker comes
out of her mouth.  Her face is hidden by the helm she wears, but a
rope mark is easily seen on her neck, sign of villain who recently
escaped from the eternal sleep.  She takes out her knife with her
clammy hands and slices off her victim's ear. &#34;heh&#34;, she 
ponders: &#34;that
was an easy kill&#34;. Puffed with pride she decides to have some fun 
and
took out a resurrection scroll.  Sweat beads fall from her face to her
dirty armor as she mutters the arcane words.  But just as Rakoth comes
back to like, he pours a full health potion down his throat...

With a speed born of tigerish reflexes and determination, Rakoth
jumps up, sweeping aside the rogue's scroll with his left hand.
Steel whispers along leather as he draws his shortsword from the
scabbard. Rakoth pins the rogue against a wall of the alley, his
blade at her unprotected throat. &#34;You've had your fun, milady, 
but 
now it's my turn.  Obviously, I've got some questions about your 
attack, 
but whether I get them from you or your ghost is of no consequence to 
me.&#34; The look in the rogue's piercing blue eyes told Rakoth that 
believed his threat.  He went on. &#34;My first question is about the 
attack.  
Are you one of those who kills others for pleasure?&#34;
She nodded. &#34;So there is nothing behind this attack save your 
twisted
desire for my ear.&#34; She shook her head, and found her voice.  
&#34;There 
is a reason, Rakoth.&#34; Rakoth arched an eyebrow.  &#34;You do 
speak.  
Excellent.  I thought you were a mute.  Now, as far as I know, there's
no price on my head...at least in this part of the region.  Who hired 
you?&#34; &#34;People interested in your demise,&#34; came the 
response.
&#34;I see...well, an obvious answer, but not as specific as I'd 
want.  Who
wants me dead?&#34; Suddenly, the rogue shoves Rakoth aside, and 
bolts 
for the end of the alley.  Rakoth hesitates for only a moment, but 
that's 
time enough. A hole, surrounded by a glowing blue nimbus,  opens up
in the very air in front of the rogue.  She dives in, and the portal 
closes 
behind her. Rakoth comes to a halt, and curses like a sailor.  The 
rogue 
left him with more questions than answers.

Carefully moving towards Lions Hope, the inn Rakoth is staying
in, he begins to ponder what the events of the past half hour
mean. Who is this rogue? Who has sent her to assassinate me?
Who, among my enemies, know magic well enough to allow
that cursed rogue to escape. This night is far from over, Rakoth
mumbles to himself. Putting on his platemail and strapping his
equipment that was left in his room into his backpack. Rakoth
fills his pouch with healing potions and steps out of his room
into the silent town of Fralesia in search of his enemy.

Rakoth knew that rogues,thieves, and others of &#34;questionable&#34;
professions usually bound together in guilds; this was especially
true of those who killed for pleasure and profit. Rakoth knew 
Fralesia 
well enough to know whom to ask.  He found hismark on a heavily
trafficked street corner. The man crouching on the corner was a 
pitiful wreck; his clothes were rags, his limbs thin from lack of 
food, 
his face gaunt and ill-shaven. &#34;Please give,&#34; he whined 
piteously. 
&#34;Help one who fought evil and now finds himself a wretch.  Help 
one who fought to save you all!&#34; His voice fell on deaf ears. 
Occasionally a copper pence would find its way into his outstretched
tin cup. Rakoth approached, using the flow of traffic to hide his 
approach until the last moment. &#34;Hello, Llystair,&#34; he 
announced as he
stood in front of the beggar. Llystair's eyes became wide as saucers. 
He shot bolt upright, and cast around to find the best escape route. 
Before he blinked twice,  however, Rakoth was standing right in front
of the beggar. &#34;You wouldn't desert a customer, now would you,
Llystair?&#34;  Rakoth's voice was full of mirth, but his face was 
grim, 
and his stare was hard.  Llystair glanced down to see a dagger aimed
at his crotch. &#34;You...you wouldn't slay an unarmed beggar, would
you, brave warrior?&#34;  Llystair tried to sound confident, but his 
voice 
wavered. &#34;Slay?  No.  Wound?  Maim?  Certainly.  But we both know 
that you're not unarmed and you're no beggar.  Matter of fact, word
has It that you're second in command of the thieves' guild 
hereabouts. 
I meant to congratulate you.&#34;
Llystair smiled uneasily.  &#34;Well, my thanks, Rakoth.  But one
doesn't usually draw steel on friends.&#34;
&#34;True enough, but we're not friends.&#34;  Rakoth drew closer.
&#34;Enough banter.  A half-hour ago a rogue used me as a pincushion
and made off with my ear.  I wasn't dead, and she was going to revive
me anyway, probably to torture me, or do something equally nasty.
When I stopped her, she escaped with a portal spell.  Now, nothing
crooked usually happens in this town without you knowing, and this
whole situation smells like a heap of cow dung.  I need to know who
she was, and she also mentioned that she was hired to off me.  I
can't live as a target, Llystair, and you will help me get to the
bottom of this.&#34;
Rakoth described the rogue and her general appearance, but Llystair
only shook his head.  &#34;Sad to say, my friend, but I don't know
who that was.  I also don't know who'd want you dead.  But as you
say, it's someone who deals heavily in magick.  That portal spell and
the scroll she had tells me that she has powerful friends.  But she
was a mere tool.  I'd look more towards the source, and where magick
is concerned, you should seek out Talas.&#34;
&#34;Talas?  I don't know him.&#34;
&#34;Nor would you.  He only set up shop hereabouts very recently.
He has a small shack on the outskirts of town.  He's a sage, a seer,
a wizard...a general all-around wise-person.  His shack is south of
here, on the banks of the river Tyren.  The only warning I'll give
you is to approach him in peace; people who have gone to him with ill
favor or wrong intentions never return.&#34;
Rakoth smiled, and saluted Llystair with his dagger.  &#34;My thank,
then, friend beggar.&#34;  Rakoth reached into his pouch and withdrew
a silver coin.  He tossed it into Llystair's cup.
He turned, and headed south, towards the shack of Talas.

He turned, and headed south, towards the shack of Talas.
Walking slowly, Rakoth came to a dark and gloomy street.  If Llystair
told the truth, then he would find the sage's shop at the next
intersection.  The street was empty, only flickering beams of
sunlight danced on the cobble stones.  The silence was disconcerting
as Rakoth's boots echoed regularly with each step he made.  A putrid
smell was lingered in the air, getting stronger and stronger as he
neared his destination.  Coming to a stop at the last house on the
street, Rakoth looked up and saw in Red ink: &#34;Talas's house of
knowledge&#34;. He pressed on the door and entered.
A flash appeared, and smoke burst out as he saw a man materialize in
the middle.  Rakoth said:
&#34;You are Talas I presume?&#34;
The sage just nodded.  Rakoth then said:
&#34;I need your help.&#34;
Talas nodded again.  Perplexed, Rakoth just told his story about the
rogue.  During the tale, Talas looked calm and just nodded knowingly.
When Rakoth finished, the sage said:
&#34;I know not of this rogue, but two days ago, a princess from the
far east came here to get two scrolls.  One was a portal scroll, the
other a reviving spell.  She had an exotic look.  Her face was like a
mix of eastern and western features.  What struck me the most was her
beautiful necklace.  It covered her skin well but at one point, when
she took the scrolls, I could see red marks on her neck.   Similar to
the marks you saw on the rogue who attacked you.&#34;
This information was enough, Rakoth remembered that an eastern
delegation was going to Queen Salmissra's court, that is where he
might find his would be killer.  He thanked the sage for the
information and walked out the door when he saw forms moving around
in the once empty street...

At first glance, Rakoth counted about 20 people.  They all dressed in
exotic uniforms with high collars, and each one held a bow of some
sort.  Rakoth swallowed hard as he realized that they were all
pointed at him.  He raised his hands in a gesture of surrender,
tracing a rune in the air as he did so.  PFFFFT... POP!  20 arrows
sailed through the space Rakoth had occupied only moments before.

Behind the shop, Rakoth panted and downed a potion of mana.  The
Teleport spell always took a lot out of him.  He knew that the
soldiers wouldn't be confused long, so he began running.  The shop
was at the very edge of the town, and the soldiers occupied the only
road back.  He would just have to break for the nearby forest and
hide out there until the soldiers --

Rakoth's train of thought was derailed as an arrow zipped past his
ear.  He paused for only a moment to mutter an incantation.  The air
around him began to shimmer as his Mana Shield went into place.  Then
he ran, as fast as his spindly legs could carry him.  A volley of
arrows pursued him, and he could hear boots tramping after him.  He
couldn't risk another Teleport, for maintaining the Mana Shield was
taking all of his energy.  Arrows were bouncing off his shield,
weakening it, and the footsteps were getting closer.  He risked a
look behind him, and immediately wished he hadn't.  10 more guards,
similarly uniformed but with long, curved swords and large shields,
were nearly upon him.  Adrenaline feeding his beating heart, he
doubled his speed.  He was nearly to the forest now.

Suddenly, his foot caught in a small hole in the ground, probably
left by some burrowing animal.  At this speed, Rakoth couldn't stop,
and he fell to the ground, just as the last arrow broke down his Mana
Shield.

Quickly standing up, Rakoth quickly downs his last mana potion.
As the last drop is drained and the guards close in on him,
Rakoth utters the shortest incantaion he know. Phasing into the
woods in between trees, Rakoth uses the last of his mana on
one last spell. Flames shoot down his arms creating a huge
barrier of flame in front of the trees. The barrier quickly spreads
in a straight line conveniently blocking his attackers from view.
Turning and running once more into the dense forest, Rakoth
hear the shouts of outrage from behind the wall of flame. This
should, at least, give him enough time to escape. No more mana
potions, Rakoth swears to himself. I knew I should have gotten
more of them.

Stumbling upon a small path, Rakoth follows it heading away
from the city. Maybe I can find a small village to restock my
supply of potions, Rakoth thinks to himself. A low growl
suddenly erupts from his left side and a blurred form launches
itsself at him......
