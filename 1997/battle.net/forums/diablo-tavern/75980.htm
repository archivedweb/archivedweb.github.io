<blockquote>
<pre>   Hello again friends and foes alike. I have just returned form 
surfing a few of our clan members pages and you know what?, I am very 
impressed. I had always known that we had a large number of great 
gamers with great minds, but this is truly awe inspiring. I would 
suggest for all members, and even non members, to seek out these 
pages and enjoy the time and work that went into them.

   And yes, the official Clan Snakegod homepages are almost at a 
completion. Some say that it has taken long enough for this, but 
quality will never take a backseat when dealing with our group.

   For those that normally visit our clan hall for good times and 
great conversations, you can give thanks to the children that feel 
they must ruin others enjoyment with their spamming and vulgarities. 
Once these people either get lifes, or at least a puppy to play with, 
we shall return to the public channel. Certain friends known to the 
court and other members in good standing (all of them by the way are 
in good standing) will be given the name to the private channel. 
Thanks for taking the time to understand our position in this matter.


SALMISSRA
QUEEN OF THE SNAKEGOD CLAN</pre>
