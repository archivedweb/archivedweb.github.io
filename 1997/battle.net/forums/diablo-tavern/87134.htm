&#62; &#62;   A few things...  It looks like TheMan is the ONLY one posting on 
&#62; &#62; the subject, and the only one wanting war..  TheMan?  If we were to 
&#62; &#62; go to war, what would that change? Would you actually FIGHT any of 
&#62; &#62; us? HAHAHAHAH...  NO, you wouldnt. War would probly mean us asking 
&#62; &#62; for duels, people declining because of fear, and everything would go 
&#62; &#62; back to normal. Couldnt you figure that out?...  So, unless you are 
&#62; &#62; willing to fight, do not post any crap about war.. it just looks 
&#62; &#62; silly. (There are at least 5 PoC that no inferno could beat in fair 
&#62; &#62; fights. NO INFERNO.) 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;            Anubis
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Why bother even arguing with The Man?  He STILL won't answer 
&#62; perfectly reasonable questions, like:
&#62; 
&#62; How he got to lvl 43 with out any dots.
&#62; How he pks people with GPOW with his &#34;GrandMother&#34; sword.
&#62; Why he calls everyone that offers him a duel a cheat.
&#62; Why he won't duel Sammy.  (Sam doesn't cheat)
&#62; 
&#62; The Man is a talker.  Someone that can't back up a word of what they 
&#62; say.  What he doesn't realize is that he makes himself look dumber 
&#62; and dumber every time he posts about fighting.  Everyone knows he 
&#62; just hangs around in INFERNO all day.  He never enters public games.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man is totally lame.  Good points though Anubis.  Why does he 
&#62; even talk about war?
&#62; 
&#62; War would just be about 20 of the best pks on b.net vs. The(wo)Man.  
&#62; (The biggest wimp that ever played Diablo)
&#62; 
&#62; Take a guess at who would win.
&#62; 
&#62; Later,
&#62; Tabbir-Wons
&#62; Animal of Power
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  When will you answer my questions The Man?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Why does rabbit have more power than man?&#34;

1.  Never wanted to kill Diablo and get dots, but one day I did.  I 
was tired of idiots (Enigma sticks in my mind) running cheat programs 
to get dots.
2.  Hehehehe, Grandfather is VERY accurate when someone knows how to 
use it.  You need SKILL to kill with a Grandfather (Hence all of PoC 
can't use it)
3.  They usually do cheat, and those I do not feel like dueling I 
decline.  I HAVE lost in duels, and have dueled quite alot.
4.  Sam cheats.  Deny it all you want, from what I heard from a few 
people, he clones people.  Call me a chicken if you want, I REFUSE to 
have my items made into dupes by some common two-bit cloning pk.

SnowRabbit, you are weak, a nothing, an also-ran, a person who could 
not cut the mustard.

You joined PoC because you could not handle INFERNO.

SnowRabbit, you are just some loser.  EVERYONE in INFERNO basically 
said they hated you, except Naga.  They think YOU, of all people, are 
the true loser in this.

Anubis, you quit, and you accuse FireBrand of cheating....not nice.

If PoC can grow up and talk without insulting everything in their 
wake, they may do well.

Then again, miracles are hard to come by.

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

P.S.  SnowRabbit, why not answer this question:  why are you a bad PK?

P.P.S.  If you don't like attitude, quit talking to me.  Besides, 
SnowRabbit, even half of the PoC think you are just lame.  You were 
let in to try and get Naga in, but Naga declined.  Tough luck getting 
used, bud.</pre>
