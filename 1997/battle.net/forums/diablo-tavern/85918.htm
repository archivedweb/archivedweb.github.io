There's nothing wrong with her head

So what if we're making a scene now
You know she don't give a shit
When she's pawing and grabbing on me now
You know I don't mind a bit

It's all good and we
Ain't gonna change now
The world is unaware
So if you want, go on and stare
'Cos we don't care
We don't care

She ain't no ball and chain

Me and my old lady
Suck each other dry
When in that position
I'm the luckiest man alive
Quenching our libidos
Passing time away
Now that we believe in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong with our head

Meaning Of Life

On the way
Trying to get where I'd like to stay
I'm always feeling steered away
By someone trying to tell me
What to say and do

I don't want it
I gotta go find my own way
I gotta go make my own mistakes
Sorry man for feeling
Feeling the way I do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in
The meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow
The meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

By the way
I know your path has been tried and so
It may seem like the way to go
Me, I'd rather be found
Trying something new
And the bottom line
In all of this seems to say
There's no right and wrong way
Sorry if I don't feel like
Living the way you do

Mota!

Mota!
Every day, well it's the same
That bong that's on the table starts to call my name
I take a hit and zone out again
I'll be paranoid and hungry by a quarter to ten
Watching reruns on my TV
I'm laughing off my ass at Three's Company
I don't know if I'm understood
But hearing Jimmy Buffett never sounded so good

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota Boy
But losing out might feel okay all night
Mota!

I'm driving down to the barrio
Going 15 miles an hour 'cos I'm already stoned
Give the guy a twenty and wait in the car
He tosses me a baggy and he runs real far
I take a hit but it smells like a clove
Oh fuck I got a baggy of oregano
This ritual is destroying me
But I guess it could be worse
It could be methedrine

Your memory's gone and so is your life (your life)
Mota Boy
But losing out just never felt so right
Your enemy's you and your couch is your life (your life)
Mota Boy
But losing out might take
Losing out might take you all night
Mota!
Losing out might feel okay all night
Yeah losing out might feel okay all life

Nitro (Youth Energy)

Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there's no tomorrow
We are the ones
Who are living under the gun every day
You might be gone before you know
So live like there's no tomorrow
Ain't gonna waste this life
There's no tomorrow - you ain't gonna live it for me
Believe it
The official view of the world has changed
In a whole new way
Live fast cause if you don't take it
You'll never make it
So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means
You'll live like there's no tomorrow - ain't gonna waste this life
There's no tomorrow - you ain't gonna live it for me
There's no tomorrow

No Hero

Once you said you'd stick to it until the end
I guess you lied
They call it suicide
Now you're gone
What was so wrong?
That you couldn't find a way to carry on

Second guess
Did I do my best?
There was a friend I had

Johnny was a weirdo
So what did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself

I should have known
You went through it alone
I wonder why
Did you even try?
You could have come to me
I would have helped you see
You could have found a way to carry on

Second guess
Did I do my best?
There was a friend I had...

Johnny was a weirdo
So what did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself
Johnny's strange behaviour
Was a tip-off, they say
But I ain't no fucking savior
I'm just living day by day

Little things
Little lives
Hanging 'til the end
I say it doesn't really mean nothing
Telling truth
Telling lies
I used to have a friend
I say it don't really mean nothing
And I can't let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this - let this go

Not The One

I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times
I carry on and never once have even questioned why
I'm innocent
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders
I'm innocent
But the battles started are far from over
We're not the ones who've kep the minorities and women down
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own
We carry on without even realizing why
We're innocent
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders
We're innocent
But the battles left us are far from over
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies
And ruined our streams
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs
That threaten our lives
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why

Nothing From Something

Things are coming down on me
They never seem to let it be
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight
The pressure's building up inside - I gotta let it out tonight
Shattered glass will cure my ills
And make me feel alright

Gonna break it and never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something

Cut me for the lion's share
It's mindless, but I don't care
'Cause no matter what I say
I'm in another fight
Take more shit, I've had enough
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up
Broken windows cure my ills
And make me feel alright

Out On Patrol

Look at my soldier boy now
With that big gun in your little hand
As you patrol this foreign land
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time

As you sit here all alone
Will your buddies come and save your life
But as the enemy appears
See your life flash before your eyes

Self Esteem

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay cause I've got no self esteem

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care, right? Yeah.

Now I'll relate this a little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

Session

I don't know when it got this way
I don't know how long she's gonna stay
Every week it's the same,
In her room - that's why I came

Here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous' never seem to end
I know where I'll be
I'll make this confession
Back in her bed for another
Goddamn session

I'll never learn, God knows I try
Keep coming back for session and I don't know why
I'll never learn, I'll never see
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me

Some might say it's a fling
For all I know it don't mean a thing
Either way I can't complain
Ain't no strings - guess I got it made

Here I go, I go again
Our little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be
I'll make this confession
Back in her bed for another goddamn session

I'll never learn, God knows I try
Keep coming back for session and I don't know why
I'll never learn, I'll never see
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me

Smash

Head over heals I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I've held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up man so bad you can taste

I don't slag no one
I don't even judge
Don't give a shit cause I'm not gonna budge
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole
I do what I want
I do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
I don't fuck if it's good enough for you
Cause I'm alive

Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast you're smashing your strife
Head over heals I've fit in before
Now I don't want to do it no more
I just want to be who I want to be
Guess that's hard for others to see

So Alone

Look at the crowd and tell me whether
All are surrounded
But none are together
If you're awake, look all around
At all of the people
Still you're so alone
So alone
If I could, I'd make a suggestion
Without sounding preachy
Or begging the question
Melt with your minds
Melt with each other
Don't be surrounded
Don't be so alone

Something To Believe In

I believe that reality's gone
Disillusion's real
I believe that morality's gone
And there's nothing to feel
If you take the sacred things
The things that we hold dear
Empty promise is all you'll find
So give me something
Something to believe in
I believe in a changing of the guard
Put our feet on the ground
See it happen in your own background
Everything breaks down
Do you accept what you are told
Without even thinking
Throw it all and make your own
And give me something
Something to believe in
Where they lead
You will follow
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
And if you look away
You'll be doing what they say
And if you look alive
You'll be singled out and tried
If you take home anything
Let it be your will to think
The more cynical you become
The better off you'll be

Take It Like A Man

When you won't go along
Some will feel like you can't find your way
Heaven knows, heaven knows
I've seen it all before

Now don't get me wrong
I've seen many a life gone astray
When someone goes
All your bows won't make it any better
So let it go

You need us to get a life
For your own good we'll take you by the hand
'Cos you need a little more

Maybe no one will say it
Maybe no one's aware it goes on
All I know, all I know it's like
Going off the deep end

Could you make a decision?
Could you think for yourself and go on?
Everyone knows, everyone knows
You've got to fit into the mainstream
So save your woes

Close your eyes
Look away now
Make believe while you can

So you'd best go along
Don't let on if you can't find your way
Many more, many more do it for you
Because heaven knows, heaven knows it's like
Playing with fire, your life's a throw.

Tehran               

In your plane in the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is no Vietnam
We will win in Iran

The Captain said kill or die
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Warrior, the time bombs
About to go
What will you feel
Will you even wonder
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye

The President said let it ride
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Great Satan
Our flags our burning

Soon America may find
Its young men in the sand
Where there casualty
Is just a number
In Iran

The President said let it ride
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Time To Relax

It's time to relax, and you know what that means. A glass of wine, 
your favorite easy chair, and of course this compact disc playing on 
your home stereo. So go on, indulge yourself. That's right, kick off 
your shoes, put your feet up, lean back, and just enjoy the melodies. 
After all, music soothes even the savage beast

Way Down The Line

Nothing changes cause it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again
Way down the line

There is a chain that's never broken
You know the story it's sad but true
An angry gets drunk and beats his kids
The same old way his drunken father did

What comes around well it goes around
Nothing changes 'cos it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again
Way down the line

At 17 Shannon is pregnant
As young as her mom when she had her
her kid is never gonna have a dad
The same old way that Shannon never had

And all the things you learn when you're a kid
You'll fuck up just like your parents did
It all just happens again
Way down the line

And welfare moms have kids on welfare
And fat parents they have fat kids too
You know it's never gonna end
The same old cycle's gonna start again
What comes around well it goes around

We Are One

We are one with ourselves
We don't give a shit about no one else
Well, it won't be long, our day in the sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down

We are one
We are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one
We are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct

We are one, you know it's true
Don't fuck with us or we'll fuck with you
It's a mentality that kills the best
We better stop
The walls come tumbling down

We are one and it won't be news
When we hang ourselves with one collective noose
Well, it won't be long, our day in the sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down

The bigger they come
The harder they fall

What Happened To You?

Before you started tokin'
You used to have a brain
But now you don't get even the simplest of things
I can draw a little picture
Or even use my hands
I try to explain but you just don't understand
Man you're really losing it
And you've really done a lot of junk now
But you keep abusing it
What in the world happened to you
It's bad enough you do it to yourself
But taking someone with you well you know that's something else
I say I'm not that kind of person
I'm not that kind of man
I try to explain but you just don't understand
I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack
If I thought that you were willing to give a little back
But you do it in the morning
You do it in the night
You lie to refrain from just facing your life
So I'll see you man tomorrow
You'll be gackin' up again
I'll see you in a coffin by the time your wad is spent
I think of all the times that I tried to lend a hand
I try to explain but you just don't understand</pre>
