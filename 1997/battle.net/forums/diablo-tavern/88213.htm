<pre>Lepthana wrote a post several days ago concerning using only a shiled 
as defense against magic--no resisitances.  Well I gave this idea a 
shot with my pure level 28 warrior in normal hell.  My armor class 
was about 140 (which doesnt really matter) with a Blessed Shield of 
the Tiger.  Since I only had this shield to test out, I tried this 
technique out.  Well, the results were as such: against one or two 
succubi this technique was about as effective as resistances.  
Against stormlords too this was surprisingly not disappointing.  
Their lightning is blocked, and when it isn't it causes little enough 
damage. With the extra armor class provided by items that raised AC 
rather than resistances (Valiant Helm of Protection versus Jaded 
Helm) if the stormlords swarmed me I was in no serious trouble.

However, with this set up, there was absolutely no way for my fighter 
to withstand large groups of succubi or fireball-mages. All in all, 
the technique wasn't too effective in normal hell with the shield I 
was using.   Still, once I find a fast block or fast recovery item 
I'm planning on trying out a few more things. 

Another fascinating idea was posted by Code Myster on the strategy 
tavern concerning rings of darkness.  Check it out; he's given 
excellent experimental data about his theory.
