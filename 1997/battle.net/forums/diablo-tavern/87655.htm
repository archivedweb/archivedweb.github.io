<blockquote>
<pre>&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

No, gold is so comon.  However, use good sence, i wouldn't hand a 
newbie 200k, however if i was in a duel and the other guy ran out of 
cash, then of course i'd give him a bit o' gold.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

Yes, unless you have something of equal value to trade with, or if 
the item was found on the same level both of you were fighting on.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

Yes, to a small degree.  However, if its a level 40 buying awesome 
plate for a level 2, then i'd say its cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

Yes.  Same as above.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

hmm, tough call.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?

No.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples 
&#62;stats?

No.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

Technically yes.  But if the low leveler thinks he can handle it, 
then sure.  However, if he was portalled in just to be pick-up boy, 
then its cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?

No.  Consider it like this: Your character becomes a hero and is 
famous, it is only natural he have squires and servants and such.  
Heck, with the amount of gold i've dragged out of the labrinth, i 
should have my own storage castle.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

Not if the characters are of close level to eachother.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

No.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

No. But its damned cheap.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

Yes, that would involve town kill.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

No.  But it is if you backup after an mk. 

&#62; &#60;---!begin more questions---&#62;
&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change character names?
&#62; #). Is it cheating to Mkill someone?
&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change accts on battle.net

Yes to the above 3.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Transfer characters to another computer?

No.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Run Diablo off your hard drive?

No.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Use utilities that allow things such as Ghost 
&#62; See?

Yes.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to use other chat utilities such as Diapolis? 
&#62; (ask a snakegod member what it is)

Don't know what it is.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to transfer single player characters to 
&#62; multiplayer?

Yes.  Different items and system of money in single player.

Dammit.  I hate doing battle.net homework.  No more of this.  Should 
anyone ever post a questionaire involving math work, i'll take an Ace 
spot and pk his sorry ass.

later.
