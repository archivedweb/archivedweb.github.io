<pre>Well the name pretty well describes the spell.
Unfortunately do to the vast similarities between
this off-shoot spell and its original (stone curse)
i accidentally studied the wrong spell the evening
in question.  Anyways, heres the story...

Going out adventuring one evening with some fellow
guild members we decided to attack nightmare/hell.
We had cleared out level 13 and were proceeding down
a corridor in level 14.  Due to the large group i had
decided for sure chain lightning was out of the question.
Instead i had readied stone curse, or what i thought was
stone curse.  A large group of fire breathing devils comes
storming up the hall, i immediately begin stoning the 
monstrosities.  Unfortunately a tarot fighter (sorry do not
remember who, spell musta got me too...) ventured into
the midst of a bunch of unstoned beasties.  I cast without
thinking and accidentally targeted my buddy.  Now normally
s.c. would have no effect on a human, and at first this
appeared to be the case as he did not go grey and i continued
to hear sounds of battle from his warrior.  However after
killing the monsters we proceeded down the hall, rounded a
corner and discouvered our warrior was no longer with us.
We called out to him, no answer.  We walked back up the hall
and there before us i saw a frozen image of our awol
comrad.  I asked him why didn't he follow, no answer.
My companions asked who i was talking to, they could not
see him.  I guess we were all tripping or something cause
i could see him plain as day, my friends saw nothing, and
our warrior pal was apparantly passed out.  During this time
no message had appeared stating that the warrior had left the
game or been timed out, so i assume it was my defunked spell.
When we got back to chat he had apparantly sobered up because
there he was waiting for us and back to his good ole self.
