<pre>... to think that pks like you are the reason we play private games.

I will give you the opportunity to withdraw this statement when I 
tell you the Truth. I personally have been playing in public games 
all day today, as Lepthana and as another character. I have been 
playing in public games from time to time ever since joining 
Snakegod. Most Snakegods don't anymore, but there are quite a few of 
us that do. And even if we didn't, it's not because we are cowards. 

I can understand why you don't understand our ways. You have 
dedicated your b.net carrer to mistrust and deception, and that's 
fine; it's your choice. I originally joined Snakegod after much 
selfdeliberation, and ultimately only because I couldn't stand the 
cheaters anymore. The legit players were getting fewer and farther 
between, and I sought refuge from the tks and aks and dupers who were 
impossible to adventure with because they killed everything before 
you could get a shot off. I joined to avoid cheating; I stayed 
because I had found a wonderful, fun, warm group of people. Sounds 
cheesy, I know, but sometimes the Truth is cheesy. 

You can go back for months on this forum and there are several posts 
by me saying that pking is a part of the game. I wouldn't have it any 
other way. Pking brings a whole new level of tension and excitement 
to the game, which is one of the things that make Diablo a step ahead 
of other games. But obviously no one likes to get killed. Sometimes, 
oftentimes, you want to play without that distraction. It's nice 
being able to fight without constantly looking over your shoulder; to 
know that if you get in trouble your friends are there to back you 
up. I don't think anyone who's seen my tactic of teleporting in 
behind the first rank of monsters to attack the rear would call me a 
coward. I don't doubt the courage of people like Elfstar ever since 
the day a couple of us died near our portal, and she was going to 
make a rescue attempt. We told her the portal wasn't safe, that she 
should take the long way, but suddenly she appeared at the portal, 
calmly raised mana shield, and batted off a dozen Storm Lords. Yes, I 
know, it was only monsters and not a reasoning human being, and 
therefore not a worthy opponent. 

I can only speak for myself, but I don't play private games to avoid 
pks. If there was no cheating, I'd never have joined Snakegod. I'm 
glad I did for entirely different reasons. I've been pk'ed many times 
before, and I'm sure I'll be pk'ed many times again. Your ego doesn't 
seem to be allowing you to see that. You pked me, congratulations. My 
life, surprisingly enough, goes on. Puzzlebox remarked that I took 
the whole thing pretty well; but how should I take it? You got me 
good. What does that prove? Maybe it proves something to you... 

Anyway, I think you need to bring your ego back down to earth for 
just a second. You don't scare me. No pk does. Except my lord and 
master, FLUFFY_BUNNY! I'm terrified of his wrath! 

Truthfully yours,

&#34;Maybe I should be scared... but why?&#34;</pre>
