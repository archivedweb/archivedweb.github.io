<pre>I am not going to apologize to quitters.

PoC, I am growing tired.

Tracy, we can duel, arrange a time sometime Friday, I am busy the 
rest of the week.  That is, if you don't chicken out. :)  I mean, you 
are PoC...how good can you be?

And, to PoC....

NO offense, but I am angry at quitters who quit and then expect the 
guild they left to be friendly.

And, I am requesting to INFERNO to have you guys banned from the 
channel.  Because of one person.

Pyro forced Fusion to quit.  And Pyro?  I may duel you..when you get 
good, and when you can talk without sounding like white trash in 
every word you say.  

So, I say this for PoC...

You guys can act all tough and big, but I still see right through 
you. You are all 13-17 year old kids trying to be big.

So, PoC, you guys can stay out of INFERNO's way, period.  

But, TO make decisions in INFERNO, so they are the ones to decide.

And to the PoC who call me a pussy, I may have cared, but you guys 
are just chopped liver also rans.  Shlonglor's Barbarians could beat 
you guys.

And Tracy?  Duel me on Friday. No ref.  If there is a ref, then just 
forget about it.  That way, we can settle it between us.

And to Elijah and the other ilk, you guys can TRY and get me in UO.  
I just hope for your sakes I don't have some &#34;advantage,&#34; 
like stones. :)

Because this is not a threat to PoC.  Nor a Warning.

This is a promise.

You stay away from INFERNO, and get lost.  And if you do not....

Then I may need to stop being as kind to you as I have been.

And SnowRabbit?  When you officially stop being a coward and come 
back, we can talk.

And now, I am off to gain the last two million experience and become 
level 50.

See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

P.S.  Flux?  Say one word about this....I dare you.</pre>
