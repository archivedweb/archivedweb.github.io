<pre>OK.. about a half of page below, Code Myster posted about &#34;How 
would it be if there were NO cheats and dupes&#34; Well, he pictured 
a dark ages of b.net infested with PK and MK who terrify population 
of B.Net. However, I think he was completely wrong. He just replaced 
cheaters with PKillers and wrote a description of modern B.Net, let 
ME tell you how would it look!
Now, if B.Net never had a cheaters or dupers, it would be very 
different endeed, first of all, supposition that NO people would ever 
join Public games in fear of PK is wrong. I remeber first months of 
B.net. You can actually check it yourself, anyway,  There would be 
MUCH more public games with Cooping people then it's now! It's VERY 
hard to beat Diablo on Hell/Hell with noncheating character with 
nonduped equipment! Believe me! I remeber FIRST ever defeat of 
Diablo, it was by team of 4 players levels 34-36 who DIED many times 
in Hell/Hell but got through it and worked as a team! if we never had 
GPOW OBZ and AAA we would have hundreds games with:&#34;Going for 
third dot any help appreciated&#34;. Yes people would fear PK's in 
fact they feared PK's in NONcheat days, but they will DEAL with it! 
For example join a game with friend and FIGHT PK instead of turning 
on Godmode! Read Anubisan's post about how he became PK! He was 
cooper and he and his buds were tied tgether! They adventured 
together and fought off all PK's, wasting them w/o mersy! He actually 
HATED PK's! He was a guy who Slaughtered Wynd The Rogue! Now, People 
would LEARN how to protect themselves from being not only PKed, but 
also MKed as well! They will FIGHT! About trade and steal, there is 
an accepted method of trade which was good enough to prevent cheating 
in trade, i.e. Bridge trade,it was garanteed way to trade before 
TELEKINESIS was allowed in town along with TK, which made trading 
DANGEROUS.. see cheats destroyed TRADE, COOP, and even PK! PK now has 
to be equipped better then his foes in order to PKill! And his 
victims behave as SHEEPS, because they are unexpirienced! Basically 
person who got GPOW on level 15 will NEVER learn how to play Diablo! 
NEVER! And Ya... just try to remeber first month of B.Net.... 
Channels such as Black loudge or Town Square were full of people 
forming coop groups for Nightmare/Hell or Hell/Hell, most of them did 
fear PK, but they knew that majority of people there were HONEST 
coopers who would back them up and help to fight PK off! It was pure 
fun. PK would win about 1 out of 3 fights with rest of team! I know 
it! Now I win 100&#37; if opponent doesn't have godmode or Unlimited 
mana! Those days people KNEW how to play and I would think 3 times 
before messing with group of 3 adventurers!</pre>
