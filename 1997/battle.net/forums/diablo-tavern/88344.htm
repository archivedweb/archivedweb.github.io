&#62; &#62; OK, let me just cut to the chase. I think it has been established 
&#62; &#62; that at level 49, you get 10,000 exp per kill. If I'm not mistakem, 
&#62; &#62; it has also been pointed out that the experience needed to jump from 
&#62; &#62; 49 to 50 is 1.3 billion. In addition, most observers seem to believe 
&#62; &#62; that The Man jumped levels in a two week period, three weeks at most. 
&#62; &#62; I will use a THREE week period, just to give The Man the benefit of 
&#62; &#62; the doubt. The Man himself has stated that he played approximately 8 
&#62; &#62; hours per day over this period. So, how many kills must he make?  1.3 
&#62; &#62; billion divided by 10000, which is 130,000. He must do this over a 
&#62; &#62; three week period playing 8 hours a day. Twenty one days times 8 
&#62; &#62; hours equals 168 hours. One hundred thirty thousand kills divided by 
&#62; &#62; one hundred sixty eight hours equals approximately 770 kills per 
&#62; &#62; hour. In one hour there are 3600 seconds (60 min x 60 sec)...3600 
&#62; &#62; divided by 770 equals 4.67. That means that in order to gain the 
&#62; &#62; necessary experience to gain level 50 over a three week period, 
&#62; &#62; playing 8 hours a day, you must kill one monster every 4.67 seconds. 
&#62; &#62; The Man was using a warrior, and of course he was playing hell hell. 
&#62; &#62; I am not really experienced with a warrior, and neither am I close to 
&#62; &#62; level 50, so I will leave it up to the readers of this forum to 
&#62; &#62; comment on the probabilty of this being done....
&#62; TheWuss is a cheater, end of story.
&#62; &#62; Is the big duel still on for tonight at 10:00 central time? Heheh
&#62; &#62; Please reply, Ogden's readers!
&#62; I suspect TheWuss will pussy his way outta this one...
&#62; &#62; Oh yeah, one other thing...some loser cheat claims to have cloned all 
&#62; &#62; of the Triad members, and also claims that he will hack account 
&#62; &#62; numbers so that our clones will have the same account numbers a s the 
&#62; &#62; real deal..is all of this possible? If so, please keep in mind that 
&#62; &#62; you may meet a clone of a Triad, and I'm quite sure he will probably 
&#62; &#62; cheat and be rude to boot...
&#62; Nope, not possible. Ever since ver.102, it has been impossible to 
&#62; &#34;clone&#34; people with trainers or programs. You COULD look at 
&#62; stats using DEye or the Gamestry Trainer, then CREATE a character 
&#62; with identical stats, etc., but you can't &#34;clone&#34; as in 
&#62; *copy*.
&#62; 
&#62; As far as account number hacking goes, another impossibility. You can 
&#62; only &#34;set&#34; your account number below approx. 15,000 (last 
&#62; time I checked), which WILL auto-correct itself and give you the 
&#62; latest account number upon your logging off of B.net. You CANNOT 
&#62; &#34;take&#34; the account number of someone who already has it. 
&#62; Another words, if someone has account#49849(&#60;--- guess who), then 
&#62; you can't &#34;set&#34; your account number to #49849, it is *already 
&#62; taken*.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Darkness devours every shining day.
&#62; Darkness demands and always has its way.
&#62; Darkness listens, watches, waits.
&#62; Darkness claims the day and celebrates.
&#62; Sometimes in silence darkness comes.
&#62; Sometimes with a gleeful banging of drums.
