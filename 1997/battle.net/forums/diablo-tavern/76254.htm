&#62; I have read enough from this Forum about how many newbies play with 
&#62; dupe items or in godly mode! Have any of you ever thought of showing 
&#62; them the goodness of playing legit? Have you people ever wonder why 
&#62; they use the godly mode? Most of them use them to prevent themselves 
&#62; from being killer by newbies killers! They come on battlenet to have 
&#62; fun and what you people do? Kill them on site and now they are 
&#62; playing in private games or if in public in god mode! Have any of you 
&#62; ever wonder or try to help them raised their levels and tell them 
&#62; nicely how nice and interesting it is to play legit? Recently it have 
&#62; to my notice that some people go to the extent in telling a newbie 
&#62; that all the legit items given to him is duped/hacked even a leather 
&#62; armor of deflection, ac=16, -3 to all enemies which i bought for him 
&#62; from Gris. So that they can pretend to coop and then killed the 
&#62; defenseless newbie!!! This is sickening! Why don't you people start 
&#62; to think and please be noted that you all are newbie once too! By 
&#62; helping a newbie gain level and experience, I'm sure there will be 
&#62; lesser cheating and duping! This is all I have to say! Thanks!
