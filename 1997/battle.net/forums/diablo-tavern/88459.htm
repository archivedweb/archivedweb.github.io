<pre>Well... I haven't posted in a real longtime...well... never 
actually...So I decided to write one of those song parody things.
Hopefully SOMEONE knows this song. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apologies to The late great Harry Chapin for mangling his song and to 
you for having to read it :) Well, here goes.






It was just after dark when the mage started down
the stairs that lead into Tristram Cemetary.
Carrying thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.
Carrying thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.

He was a young mage,
just out on his second trip.
And he was carrying the town's salvation,
for every one to shout and be cheery,
when demons hide within their lair,
and backyard stock-piles of hasty weapons. Mages managed to drink 
that day,
thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana
Yes, just about thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.

He passed a sign that he shoould have seen,
saying &#34;Shift to high level, spells will be needed this way.&#34;
He was thinking perhaps of the cold mug of ale
who was waiting at the journey's end.
He started down the two mile drop,
the jagged rocks that lined the side of the crack.
He was pushing on through the depths of hell that went on to Diablo.
Just a few more levels to go.
then he'd go home and have ale drown his long cramped day away.
and the taste of thirty thousand bottles, of strong ale.
Yes the taste of thirty thousand bottles, of strong ale.

He was picking up steam as the level of Diablo opened up before him.
But he paid no attention as the blood stars pounded upon and through 
him.
His foot bumped a barrel as he walked onwards.
But the mage lost balance without a groan.
He said &#34;Christ!&#34;
It was funny how he had named the only man who would not go there.
He was trapped in a face first nose plant,
riding on the barrel so fast,
was every one of those deep blue,
I'm telling you thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.
Yes, there were thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.

He barely mad it through the horde that led into the dead end hall,
And he missed the passing maw, at 90 rolls per minute.
And he said &#34;God, make it a flange&#34;
As he saw a mace pop out of a spawn.
And sideswipped nineteen neat parked spits,
clipped of 13 succubi,
hit two magi, bruised 8 'stroms,
and Blue-crossed 7 people,
it was then, he lost his head,
not to mention an arm or two before he stopped.
And he slid for four hundred yards, allong the depths of 
Tristram/hell.
All those thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.

You know the man who told me about it on the trail,
as it winded up to Tristram, Blizzard tech,
he shrugged his shoulders, shook his head,
and he said (and this is exaclty what he said)
&#34;Boy, that must've been something.
Just imagine thirty thousand bottles, of blue mana.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds, of wasted blue mana.
Of blue mana. Just blue mana. Thirty thousand bottles.
Of blue mana. Not no mage no more. Just blue mana!&#34;


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, that was it... tell me what you think as i have tons 'o' ideas 
for other songs

&#34;Singing dwarfs are dangerous&#34;</pre>
