<blockquote>
<pre>&#62; I would just like to address the topics of conversation in the 
&#62; Snakegod channel. Today and tonight the Snakegod Hall witnessed some 
&#62; of the worst drivel it has ever seen. I can't believe, in 

You are of course right Lept.  We try very hard to be hospitable, but 
there are always those that will take advantage of this.  We have a 
lot of visitors to the channel, and they do not know who is a member 
and who isn't so it could reflect on the clan as a hold if things get 
out of hand.  In my opinion, it should not matter whether you are a 
member or not, you should behave with respect when you're a guest in 
a channel.  

  I know there are always some people who figure that they'll behave 
anyway THEY want to, anywhere THEY want to and to hell with everyone 
else.  Well, your parents should be ashamed for having raised someone 
with such a lack of social skills.  You should try the public 
channels where your artistry in vugalrity will be recognized and 
appreciated.

  Just wanted you to know that I appreciate being in the channel when 
the fastest gavel in the west is op.  I just wish as part time 
doorman, I could decide who to admit or not.

&#34;Park your attitude outside, and come on in the channel for a 
good time!&#34;</pre>
