&#62; Ok in INFERNO's prime Peg was leader and a active on at that, then
&#62; Diablo lost intrest.  Tracy Lords was left in charge and did alot
&#62; of things she shouldn't have.  Peg came back to power and fixed most 
&#62; the thing Tracy did wrong and made on or two mistakes himself.  Then
&#62; Peg became a inactive player which casued PoC to seperate.  Still
&#62; Peg did not show his face.  Lionel came up with the idea of takeing 
&#62; over INFERNO which sevral of us did.  Then when we got INFERNO back 
&#62; on its feet Flux, The Man, and Halpo when to war for the leadership of
&#62; INFERNO.  With them fighting and no one knowing who to follow nothing 
&#62; ever got done.  At least with Peg everyone followed him almost 
&#62; blindly.  Anyhow most of INFERNO got sick of not doing anything and I 
&#62; now declare that INFERNO is in a worse off pitt then it was right 
&#62; after PoC left, and that was pretty bad.  
&#62; 
&#62; A.K.Legacy
&#62; &#34;Just pick ONE leader and do it fast!&#34;



I did a lot of things I shouldn't have eh?  Such as: Forming an 
alliance with PoDW, getting people to get web pages up, getting 
public board up, assinging leaders and getting people in action.  
Only two things I did that made people act like little cry babies and 
not PK are BAN The Man and Eugene.  Wahhhh, God, that is when the 
rest of you made me sick.  Waaah, 'a guy we have never seen kill got 
banned, waahhh I want him back'.  Then I get the best duelist on 
b.net to join INFERNO and everyone has another temper tantrum!  Then 
you guys go and form a 'new' inferno?  That was disgrace.  Listen, 
INFERNO doesn't NEED a fricking leader.   We don't have one.

Things I find as totally humorous.

1.I boot The man from inferno.  Everyone cries.  I leave INFERNO.  
The man comes back.  The Man is booted AGAIN! HAR HAR!
2.They make a new inferno and dis on the founder.  Then they vote 
Haplo as a TO? har har har!

Well, INFERNO will last through this.  Most the people on that are 
talking about the downfall of INFERNO have no clue to the behind the 
scenes action of what was going on.  Hell, I am one that left and I 
think INFERNO will get through all this.  Later.
