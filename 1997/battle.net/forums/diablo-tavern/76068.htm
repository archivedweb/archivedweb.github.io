<pre>Well, lets see...  I have bought a masters sword o haste (bastard) and
on a recent normal/hell run I found a Masters Sword of Vampire which
I am using until I can find a dreamflange again.  (I died sunday.)  My
guy has saw tons of godly helms and whale helms and I think I saw a
godly helm of the whale at wirt once.  I stuck with thinking cap 
needless
to say (it was 31 dur like my new one just got to yesterday) I have 
found
a obs of heavens (It was amulet) but it had some pretty bad stats for 
a 
ring of heavens it was only 32&#37; resist all and +12 to all.  My 
guy has a 
saintly plate of the giants now (full plate version) which I bought 
from 
gris for 134K (damn thats alot) and I just bought an Awesome Shield 
of 
the Tiger from gris for 80k.  I once bought a kings sword of ages 
(claymore)
but my comp crashed and (it was a single player) I had dropped it to 
make
room in my inventory for my nightmare/hell run.  That's all I can 
think of right
now.  Later.

P.S. Kai, if you're reading this have you heard of a game called 
Bloodstone?
Please answer me, I think I emailed once but got no reply.</pre>
