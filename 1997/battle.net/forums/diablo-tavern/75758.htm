<blockquote>
<pre>On behalf of my new &#34;Elite&#34; clan of PKers, the HYSTERIA would 
like to ask TheMan and/or Anubisan into our clan. We would like to 
extend this invitation to any and all other player killers.  Any 
pkers are welcome as long as they follow the rules of the clan.  
Please consider this invitation and check out our page.  If anyone 
does consider joining please consider my division, The Hysteria 
Security and Defense Division. SnowRabbit, maybe we can compare notes 
sometime, (unless u r not going to talk to me like the rest).  I'm 
sorry that some Inferno members are angry with this clan due to the 
fact that our leader &#34;flamed&#34; you.  I didn't feel that his 
comment about y'all being dissorganized was a flame just an 
observation. (in some ways it may have been a false observation as 
some members such as morte have shown me their hard work and 
dedication in the organization field towards the clan.)  Please 
excuse my clan for being an attack against y'all but think of us as 
another branch of &#34;Elite&#34; player killers with our own views 
and systems for getting things done.  BTW, I do feel that planning 
for this game now is not a bad thing.  My main intentions for being a 
unit leader in Inferno was to put a quit to the internal bickering 
and crap that was taking place.  That is why i introduced the 
internal affairs division.  Not very much feedback was given to me 
about it and i got the impression that u guys didnt care.  The 
opportity of leading a new pk clan jumped at me and i took it.  I'm 
sorry if i hurt some of u but this is what was best for me as a gamer 
and best for my character.  I have made too many mistakes in the past 
to be respected in INFERNO now and i need to go somewhere where i 
will be more of an asset.  Thanks for taking the time to read all 
this...All replies are appreciated (even flames).
I'm Sorry For Leaving,
acidic_overdose(HYSTERIA) &#34;UO&#34; ('Commander'HSD)
please visit the Hysteria webpage with open accepting eyes, not 
closed ignorant ones.

thanks...

&#62; We simply could not come to a resolution.
&#62; 
&#62; If I have to leave to get TheMan out of INFERNO, so be it.
