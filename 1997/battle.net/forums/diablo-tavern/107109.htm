Actually, these guys are right. I have no life or girlfriend. But I'm 
really 74 years old, so you can't have much of a life at my age. All 
I ever do is sit around and play Diablo and collect Social Security, 
all  of which goes to pay for my ISP so I can play on battle.net 24-
7. It all started back when my wife died at my own hands. All the nag 
ever did was bother me about how much I played Diablo. &#34;Why can't 
we go out somewhere&#34;. She wanted to go out, so I took her out, 
with my handgun. She won't be nagging me no more. I never needed her 
anyway, I got Diablo. And as soon as Diablo II comes out, I'm gonna 
get that and play that all day too. I think I'll close now. It's time 
to eat some prunes and get back on battle.net. -- SZ</pre>
