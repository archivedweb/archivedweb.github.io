<pre>i was only voicing my concern over these events..and my anger over 
seeing the items that some of my other clan members have.

i do not think one can find a godly helm of whale at level 39 in 
nightmare hell, or even on sale for that matter.i dont believe one 
can be so lucky as find ob zod rings (if anyone even HAS them..ive 
never seena  REAL one..must be a sight to behold!)

i KNOW snakegod doesnt cheat, but when you have 90 plus members, i 
mean, somewhere, there has to be a little slip up ..even if they dont 
realize they have duped items.ill admit, that before i joined 
snakegod, i had a duped royal circlet and ob amu of zod..but i dumped 
them (much to my disgrace) and obtained suitable replacements.

i just want to let the clan know that the post was only meant as an 
open question....the question being: are you sure you dont cheat?

i KNOW none of us use hack programs or editors,or what have you, but 
its very easy to pick an item up froma  friend who claims it to be 
real, and since you trust your friend, you keep it, not even thinking 
for a second that the kings sword of blood he gave you was 
duped....how come i NEVER found these items? i used to spend a little 
over an hour each day creating serial modem games and checking gris 
and wirt in hopes of finding half the stuff everyone else in my clan 
has.when i heard blackwind and gilgamesh bragging about their awesome 
weaponry one day last week, that was it, it made me sick to my 
stomach.i guess i really do suck..has anyone at all found the 
following, and if so, tell me how and where you found them:

any ob of zod jewelry
any godly plate
godly helm of whale
KSOH,KSOB,KSOV,KSOS

i've never seen themm....is it possible?


to shaft and salmissra, and anyone else who was offended, look, we 
all have to examine oursleves and ask ourselves, are we 100&#37; sure 
we are clean? heck, not even me! i gained 5 experience levels (31-36) 
using an ob zod ring and a royal circlet until i chucked them.just 
dont let it worry you, if you dont cheat, then forget it.i just dont 
want any members using super powerful items and then dying and then 
people can see their stuff and wonder...how did he get that at level 
32???  thats all..chill :-) i mean, i dont know any of the new 
members...so i cant say...either good or bad things, so i cant talk i 
guess.
