<blockquote>
<pre>Good thread. Lets see if I can come up with 10 moments ;)

1) First diablo kill. With my first character who is no longer in 
action (too many bad shrines).

2) First nightmare game. I was playing with the founder of my first
clan, and he got smoked in lazzies room. Just me and him in the game.
He kept on saying &#34;please don't die&#34;. I smoked everyone in 
lazzies
room and saved the day. (had 1 mana potion left!)

3) First fight with another character. I had been reading ogdens
for a while, and figured I'd go hunting with my new rogue. I met
up with Tracy_Lords and ASH. I was 24, they were mid 30's but I said 
what the hell. They both smoked me pretty good, but I got to talking 
to them and found out they were cool.

4) First Pk attempt. I was playing with peglegrogue and Raistlin.
We had this mage down in hell. Peg says &#34;lets see what you 
got&#34;.
So I go and start shootin' at this mage. He never even noticed 
since my arrows could not hit him. He smoked me accidentaly with
CL ;) Then peg and raist killed him a few times and gave me some 
pointers.

4) First obsidian zodiac. Ends up being my only obsidian zodiac.
Found with my mage who no longer plays. Have found one jade zodiac
and no other combo zods.

5) First succesful pkill. Second actual attempt. On peg and raist's 
suggestions, I went out and found me a better bow. A meteoric bow of
precision. I thought it was the whip. I killed another
rogue who kept on taking the gold from monsters that I killed.
hehe, and I liked it 80

6) First duel. The first time I duelled with Silencer I was
actually nervous. I of course lost to some warrior du to the fact
that he had a stormsheild/GPOW/KSOH, etc.. but he said he was legit!

7) Accepted into INFERNO. At the time, the best pkilling federation
on bnet. I was one of the few, the proud, the deadly. Not to mention, 
back then it was a hell of a lot more fun. No petty squabbling.

8) First Mkill. Was &#34;co-oping&#34; with this warrior. He had a 
damn 
AAApoc staff and was apocing everything in sight. I pinned him,
killed him, and res'ed him in the middle of about 10 balrogs.
Normal stuff dropped. AAAPoc, obsid zods (the whole set). GPOW
lightforge helm. Took all his stuff and started a private game. 
Dropped it all and left.

9)The great pk debate. Now that was interesting.

10) Getting ICQ, and People actually added me to their contact list!
I considered this an honor.</pre>
