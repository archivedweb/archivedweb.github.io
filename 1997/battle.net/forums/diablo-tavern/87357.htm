<pre>it's no secret that TheMan was kicked out of (OLD) Inferno for his 
powerhunger... Now he is getting kicked for SAME exactly thing from 
NEW Inferno... cool.... and Haplo? Forget it loser... I was on 
tonight and tested freshbought Nova staff.... well what can I say? 
With level 20 Nova does about 60 damage MAX.. So..... Ya... u sure 
been losing legit duel badly if you had to make such sorry excuse as 
Nova... try not to cheat in duels.. u are in Inferno now not in KoR.. 
or at least if you do cheat do not invite nonpartial Referee... 
Because... it's sucks to be a loser and a cheater at same time....  
Yup.. TheMan? U are Inferno history.... I heard ALOT of threats from 
YOU and I never was actually affected at any way.....Flux is far more 
scary then your sorry ass.. and she does duel by the way....Take care 
pathetic chapter in history of Inferno.. and YES.. u can try to split 
Inferno even more.... if ALL u want is power and asskissers
P.S. Flux? Go on... And who made Haplo To by the way?
P.P.S. If I again hear from TheMan responce on message I said NO 
responce from TheMan I am going to hunt him down in UO and make his 
head roll... Yes.. it's a threat.. I do not make threats which I 
can't back up... and TheMan? U mess with ME u gonna go begging around 
as U did after I threw your pathetic ass from Inferno U remeber that? 
I never seen anybody quite so sorry and funny.. I even had a pity for 
you.... u was sooooo pityfull and selfhumiliating.. &#34;Ohh 
pleeaassee let me back in! I didn't do anything.. pleeaaasseee&#34; U 
wanna do it again? har har har har... I can make it... U know it..
P.P.P.S. haplo? Get some brains.... and remeber any bull who messes 
with me ends up as a BBQ!</pre>
