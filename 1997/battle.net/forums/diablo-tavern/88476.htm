<pre>Simply, I have decided that the game Diablo is not worth the price. I 
found it repetitive, boring, and, overall, far too short. The 
interest was slightly sustained by the quests, which gave me a slight 
deviation from the boring routine, but didnt get followed up on 
enough to make them seem worthwhile. The weapons were not varied 
enough, and for the 400 meg+ size of the game the small number of 
characters, incomplete animation and 16 or so levels was far too 
shallow for what could have been better.
The Big red end of game character was a let down, and probably not 
just to me.
The spells were a slight redemtion point for the game, but were not 
&#34;fun&#34; enough to be worthwhile.
There was _nearly_ no variation to the gameplay:
Open door.
Kill enemy.
Collect money.
Continue untill next level.
Repeat.
Oh, along the way the character improves, but lacks the fun 
uniqueness of having something special about them.

I know some people love the game, and I did stay playing it untill 4 
in the morning, but the sheer dullness of it and simplicity of 
gameplay, lack of decent character movements (chop chop chop, sheild 
up, chop chop chop chop chop, monster dies, pick up bow, shoot, 
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,..etc..) makes me wonder where Blizzard 
was going when they released this seemingly half complete game. Maybe 
Diablo 2 will be better, if they make the game FUN to play.</pre>
