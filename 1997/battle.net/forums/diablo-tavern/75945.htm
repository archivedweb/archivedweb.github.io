<pre>Tis I LordMayhem i was wondering if u guys post message's here or 
even visit here i hope if u are reading this to do a check up on some 
message's i wrote last night check em out on #2 on the bottom It 
talk's about my being player killed all the time and sad to say i was 
very dissapointed in looking at u'r dammed page i personaly look at 
u'r web site everyday since i fell in love with that guild and regret 
not being in well anyway i remember when 하ntrag said lets go to the 
dungeons and well i went in their and 하ntrag never hit me and i died 
i knew something was fishy and knew it was a ghost since i've been 
struck by them numerous times and i looked and saw this person who 
goes by the name of [)EAT][-][    dam cheater maybe it was to see if 
i would have used god mode maybe thats why 하ntrag used that cheatin 
assasin anyway but kept duing it like a dumb a** and i now 하ntrag 
used god mode the first time and claim's i would use it i may have 
done some bad things to the guild of The Crimson Rose but i would 
never go as far as to using god mode or cheating as said before i am 
one of the very few legit players still out there and cant join a 
desent game without being hunted by HighLord하ntrag's cheating 
assasins that bothers me alot and i may add u guys have to cheat to 
get an ear show's how much HONOR u dont got dont give me that bull 
that i'am a assasin i dont go by the rules i do my job and ect... u 
have no HONOR thats what u should be saying not i'am an assasin that 
i despise but o well opion's very well hope i didnt piss u off by 
saying bad things about u'r assasins i'am only speaking the truth and 
am sick of getting player killed dont u think u have done enough u 
got a post up of my ear's i think thats enough go hunt something else 
man i'd be bored hitting the same target over and over and over and 
over as much as u'r getting tired of me repeating it as of now hehe 
see how it is boring and still respect the members i knew of the 
guild when i was ONCE in well i'am off again into battle to go defeat 
diablo and his minions once again cause None Shall Escape the Wrath 
of Mayhem!!!!!!!  Hope u guys have a great time well i assume u do 
anyway :) </pre>
