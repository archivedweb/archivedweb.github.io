<pre>Well Cuda,

Welcome to Tarot!  I'd also like to welcome our other new members -- 
LowRider (some kind of Ace in UO -- slight position conflict at the 
moment), Loring (Three of Coins), and Dravyn (Three of Swords).  Hope 
to play with you all soon.

Hmmm ... guess I won't lie about it.  The decisions to keep the 
bounty hunter positions, as well as let in known PKs, even though 
they will be subject to guild rules regarding proper bounty hunting 
procedure, were controversial.  I hope not so much that anyone in 
Tarot feels they must leave because of it.  We have always had these 
positions ... they just got a bit more exposure lately.  Smash, 
nIGHT, and others all hunted and PK'ed to preserve the honor of Tarot.

We have always been, and perhaps now always will be, a non-PK guild 
with five PK/bounty hunter positions.  These positions have always 
been subject to the position of Judgment. (Braveheart, as Emperor, is 
fulfilling Judgment's duties until such time as the position is 
filled.) We don't PK for the sake of PK'ing.  If any of those five 
positions PKs, it is for the greater good of Tarot and only for that.

&#62; The talking is finaly over, the decisions have been made. I have 
&#62; accepted the responsibilities that are the Office of Death of Tarot.
&#62; 
&#62; I am proud and honored to have been offered this office and I will 
&#62; perform my duties to the best of my abilities, well, when I'm sober 
&#62; that is. O;)
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks to Zaphod, Yaz, nIGHT and of course Brave Heart for the 
&#62; confidence. I'll try to keep the office with honor.
&#62; 
&#62; Alright everyone, PARTY TIME, drinks are on Death!

&#62; See ya all soon!
