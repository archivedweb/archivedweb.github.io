chasing off PK'ers!?  What is the world coming to?

&#62; I was sleepless and rather bored after spending some time in Snakegod 
&#62; listening to Eugene's usual spiel (indirectly of course -- I squelch 
&#62; that hate-spewing geek on sight). I figured what the heck, grabbed my 
&#62; newbie-killer (lvl 7 warrior) and went trolling. Well, the first game 
&#62; I saw was &#34;legits only&#34;. Yeah, right, I thought, and joined. 
&#62; I figured there had to be ONE guy in full plate or some jerk with a 
&#62; bazillion HP. That's what had always happened to me when I made a 
&#62; game with such a name. My plan was to whack these idiots for crashing 
&#62; such a game. 
&#62; 
&#62; I joined and there were 2 warriors and 1 wizard (ranging from lvl 1 
&#62; to lvl 6) standing in town. None had even chain mail, none had even 
&#62; triple-digit HP. 
&#62; 
&#62; I then spent a few uncomfortable moments exlaining that my character 
&#62; was legit. He had hand-me-down splint mail, which gave him a 
&#62; different graphic, and a crown of the lion, which boosted his HP. 
&#62; Guess I looked pretty, well, illegit ... So I stood on one side of 
&#62; the river and let them look at my stuff. All legit, but indeed too 
&#62; powerful for a reasonable coop game (hey I wear it to cut thru that 
&#62; GPOW, not whack skellies ...). So I went and made a lvl 1 character, 
&#62; transferred nothing and went to work.
&#62; 
&#62; It was a BLAST ... a lot like the &#34;good old days&#34; that BLZ 
&#62; was talking about. I found a mace of the mind (+3) and the Wiz almost 
&#62; cried! Of course one of the warriors (lvl 3) had the bright idea of 
&#62; releasing the Butcher. After doing an iron man game with BLZ this 
&#62; very same day I was well aware of how foolish this was ... but hey, I 
&#62; told him it would be fun but he might regret it ...
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, to make a long story short, Butchie chased us all over the 
&#62; place and eventually killed all three of us (one warrior dropped due 
&#62; to lag). We then had a great time trying to grab our stuff, find the 
&#62; stairs to 3, and not get turned into hamburger at the same time :)
&#62; 
&#62; On 3 we stumbled across Leoric and I played rabbit while the mage 
&#62; blasted him with Holy Bolt. Leoric fell without any of us getting a 
&#62; scratch, leaving some rags which, to add insult to injury, got eaten 
&#62; by lag :p
&#62; 
&#62; In the midst of this I actually had to ask a PK buddy of mine who had 
&#62; joined the game looking for me to leave these guys alone. I mean, a 
&#62; full public game with only legits is just too precious a thing to cut 
&#62; short with a PK ... however much fun it usually is :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well after awhile I had to go (it is getting mighty late after all) 
&#62; so I referred them to Snakegod as I was leaving. I know that Snakegod 
&#62; and Inferno have their deep philosophical differences, but I think 
&#62; legit players are to be nurtured whenever encountered. Salmissra 
&#62; folds the legit co-oppers to her busom whilst I and my friends like 
&#62; BLZ, Morte and Elijah hunt the cheaters. Good division of labor, eh?
