<pre>Heyas Cuda,

There did seem to be a lot of &#34;oops, sorry about that&#34; going 
on, but a lot of it was probably due to player tiredness. I for one 
was semi-asleep at the keyboard and was having problems hitting the 
right hotkey, amongst other things. At one point, Kargan was 
surrounded by vipers, so I switched to stone curse (or so I thought), 
and started casting away. It took a little while before I realized I 
had inadvertently switched to fireball. ;) Sorry about that Kargan, 
hope I didn't fry you too badly... Then there was the time I switched 
to chain lightning and tried to teleport over a wall- good thing 
nobody was in front of me. Hmm, with the 3-guild games coming up, 
maybe I shouldn't be mentioning stuff like this. I'm a good co-op 
player, really, just ask, umm...well...

Everyone seemed to be making mistakes one way or 
another...Sir.DesChenes did the same thing to me that I did to 
Kargan, zapping me with fireballs instead of casting stone curse. 
Good thing I had a garnet ring on for a change. ;) I guess my point 
is, you did seem a bit rusty, Cuda, but nothing serious- there were 
just a lot of extraneous factors involved. I'm looking forward to co-
oping with you again!

P.S. Pluto, you were dead right about the lag in that game with Kari 
and Irish. That PK undoubtedly was due to lag...but it doesn't make 
for as good a story that way. ;)</pre>
