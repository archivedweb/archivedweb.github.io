<pre>Okay, to all who may care, 

Talon and The Godly Soul posted some offensive messages against gays 
and women.  They did not say &#34;you are gay&#34; but they explained 
rape and other violent sexual acts on a public forum, with children 
of all ages and many others reading.  We did not deserve that.

They can deny it and say it is another ISP, but Talon HAS done stuff 
like that before.  If you think back two months, he posted as Sexy-
Rogue in a similiar fashion, minus the swear words.  And The Godly 
Soul already admitted it and he WANTS to be banned so he can hack his 
ISP and comeback on.

Well, if you read posts #74924 and #74937 you will see some 
disgusting filth posted by them, explaining how rape is 
&#34;okay&#34; by The Godly Soul and how Talon views &#34;Gay 
Rape.&#34;  It is sickening.

I do not care of if you like me or hate me or hate INFERNO or like 
INFERNO, that does not matter.  What MATTERS is that we do not have 
to take this from those people.  This is OUR forum, and we follow the 
rules.  We maybe say a swear word or two, maybe we attack other 
players calling them &#34;losers,&#34; but NONE of us (Except Eugene) 
have posted about Rape, Racism, and the like.  If we did, we were 
banned from the forum, and maybe let back on one month later or so.

Sign this petition and Email Blizzard and ask for those two posts, 
#74924 and #74937, to be deleted from the forum, and the posters 
banned from the forum.

Now, some people think they are not guilty.

First of all, my ISP says &#34;DEFAULT.&#34;  I don't know why, I 
just know it does.  I did not change it, it just is.  I can still 
only post twice every two hours.  But, besides that.....

The Godly Soul admitted it, enough said.  Talon even apologized, so 
they DID it.  There is no more need to even try to convict them.  We 
all make mistakes.  But those were attacks on people that were 
uncalled for.  They crossed the line of being &#34;I will insult your 
guild by calling them losers.&#34;  They went overboard and offended 
many people, and whomever read it should be angry and not stand for 
that.

This is in a sense OUR forum, and we have the right to insult each 
other, post stories, post for our sites, contact friends, etc.  We 
can flame.  But we DON'T joke about rape.

And Eugene should also be banned for defending their posts and saying 
&#34;Rape is done right if done with style&#34; or something like 
that.  Eugene, I thought maybe you even were nice to THIS, but you 
just plain disgust everyone.  Thanks, Eugene, you are a signal that 
their are scum in the human race.

I would like to say I am sorry for these Three (The Godly Soul, 
Eugene, and Talon) for what they did.  I did not do it, I did not 
provoke it, but they crossed the line and deserve to be banned for 
this unruly conduct.  They went over the line.

So, please sign this petition, which clearly states The Godly Soul, 
Talon, and Eugene should be banned for their rape posts.  They can 
then post again after they &#34;hack the ISP&#34; but then Blizzard 
will ban the, again.

Lately, no one has been banned because no one even &#34;dares&#34; to 
post this garbage, but when it was done in the past, the post and 
thread were deleted and the person banned. (You know, don't you, 
Eugene?).  So, Blizzard can still do it.

So, sign this petition, NOT because of me or anything I say, but 
because it is right and will keep the forums clean for us, the other 
players.

Thank you, and God Bless.

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

P.S.  To those who signed, thank you.  You are doing the right thing.</pre>
