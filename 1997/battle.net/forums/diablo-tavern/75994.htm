<blockquote>
<pre>Well, gentlemen (you too, Sarco and Anubisan) and ladies (now THAT 
includes you, Sarco and Anubisan :), I am kicked out of INFERNO, and 
now that I am going, I think it is time for me to say my goodbyes, 
for I am not to be UO INFERNO and Diablo is basically dead.  So, now 
I am out forever.  But, it is my last post...so, I am going out with 
a bang.

Gentlemen, my story.  I began as Blade, a level 1 nothing who build 
himself to level 39.  He was strong, brave, and my pride and joy.

I bought Diablo by accident, and it ended up being a good thing.  I 
was a good game.  I made pretty good salary, so, it was worth the $50 
dollars.

Well, I began my lonely beginnings as The Man, a character I created 
as a joke.  I began to worth to build him up (this is when cheats 
just came on the scene).  Then, the fateful game....

I joined a game called &#34;Help me!&#34; and three players were 
there, two warriors, one rogue.  We went down, and this guy, JOE, 
went after me. I barely got away.  He laughed at me, then left.

I then followed him, and got his number. (I was one of the few who 
knew about this command :)  And, I got it.  It was 45394.  And, I 
followed him.

I made it to level 38, no dots.  I cared nothing about them, I just 
wanted this guy dead.  And, there he was.  This loser...JOE, level 
43, no longer level 12.  

I hunted him, and killed him.  And, he died :)  I then became a PK in 
my spare time.

Along this time, I met Devin, one of the best damn PKs I knew on 
B.net.  She was small time, but she taught me everything I needed to 
know.  She is probably the ONLY girl I know who plays Diablo (Besides 
flux :) and she was pretty good looking (picture :) but, a blonde, 
not my taste. :)  Well, she then one day left, personal problems, and 
I was left alone on B.net.

Then, it started.  The BIG stuff.  One day, I found the forum.  By 
accident.  And what should I see, but INFERNO everywhere.  It was so 
nice.  These guys, the INFERNO, player killers.  This was around the 
time of cobi, and Ash, and Wynd the Rogue.  Wynd became a symbol of 
hate for me. I hated PKs, but I WAS a PK..bad logic. :)  So, I flamed 
him one day...I was level 43 by then, no dots. ( Tribute to Joe)

Bye this time, I had already lost my number of about 4000 something 
to now number 7---- something (I NEVER quite remember :(.  So, I 
flamed Wynd.  Then, I met Mikedog.

Mikedog is probably the best damn Warrior PK there is, and I miss him 
so.  He flamed me..so we had a little war. :)

And, I ended up one night meeting him, in game Mikedog.  Needless to 
say, he kicked my ass :) (I did not know about Fireresistance UNTIL 
then :)

Well, I vowed revenge.  And, I got fire resistance.  And, I beat 
him..with a damn staff equipped. (Was Thundercall :)  And how, after 
I beat him twice, he tried to TK me :).  But, it was okay..cheats 
were new, right?

Then, I went into the INFERNO channel.  There, I met PegLeg, Ash, and 
Anubisan.......the resident racist of B.net (Next to Sarco.)  I 
generally flamed them, and they squelched me (NOW you know how I 
perfected those techniques to anger people. :)

It was fun..until one day, INFERNO became plagued by cheats.  A good 
number of them were cheating.  And, then, Mikedog quit, and became my 
friend.  We made &#34;peace.&#34;

Then, as fate would have it...Sarcomastogora and I met....Eugene 
himself.  He seemed arrogant, nasty, hateful..just what I needed to 
help me get INFERNO.

So, we began little &#34;raids.&#34;  Our chemistry was great.  I 
have to admit, if you ever want ANYONE to piss people off, get Sarco. 
:)  Well, we hounded INFERNO, and Sarco was awesome.

Well, PegLeg got mad at me, and then, we ended up wanting to duel.  
Sarco then suggested a plan to me.  This was it...&#34;we gunna clone 
them.  Say you did.  i handle the rest.&#34;  I said okay.

I fought PegLeg, noticed small flame on his sword (WOAH I said :) and 
got beat.  Peg then said, and I quote, after he killed me 
&#34;kill.&#34;  THAT is lamer then RESISTANCE IS FUTILE, etc.  You 
can't beat that. :)

Well, I came back..Sarco whispered.  And, then, we said I cloned Peg.

It angered him, and he got mad, and then some guy named Raolin said 
he KNEW Peg cheated, etc.  And, it got bigger and bigger.  Then, I 
met flux-babe.

I pretended to buy an ear off her ( A mikedog ear :)  And, she told 
me about the Virginkiller. :)

So, I told Sarco I would pretend to clone her..and he appluaded my 
efforts.  So, then Sarco and I go to a game..and he gives me a crown 
with a skull on it..called the Lightforge.  &#34;COOL!&#34; I said.  
&#34;What is it for?&#34;  
&#34;Nothing&#34; Sarco said..and told me to brag about how I got it 
from Peg.

Well, it slowly got worse when I said I got it from Peg..and I guess 
he DID have one.  Then, I was spammed by Peg and flux for hours. :)

Well, then, I met Anubisan, and I pretended to clone him..he handled 
me really cool, not doing anything. I INSTANTLY respected him.  He 
seemed too cool for me. :)

Well, then, Sarco and I did our best to ruin INFERNO.  Then, I 
learned about &#34;Bahamut, King of the Espers&#34;

He was a nice guy, and I defended him, so we went out to cleanse 
INFERNO.  It was nice :)  But, soon, that plan turned to disaster, 
and he left.  So, I was alone.

For a break in the action, between this time I met Dennis, a Warrior. 
He and I NEVER PK'd together, we were always CO-OP.  He is now 
Darkmage.  He and I found LOTS of stuff co-oping, and he is probably 
one of the best you will ever meet. *shameless plug* :)

Well, then, Hell Knights started entering the channel.  My first REAL 
friend was Tyrael.  And, then I also met Prime, Fusion, and others.  
They were real nice guys.  HK are the best :)

Well, after that, Peg and I kept hating each other, and no one forgot 
my cloning joke.  But, as things went on, I began to be more bold and 
befriend people.  Like Tyrael, acidic Overdose, SnowRabbit.  Plus, 
Lord Pantera, our now own resident &#34;Evil Ernie.&#34; :)

Abou this time, Eugene was in his prime, Tarot was starting to be 
big, and the jokes of &#34;Disco INFERNO&#34; were dying down. Wynd 
had left, story telling was in, and the first patch was out.  All was 
well.

I then began to hate cheaters with a passion. Anubisan, now who hates 
my guys, taught me to hate them with a passion. (Remember your old 
number, Set?  #16552?)  Well, then Set came along...he flamed me all 
the time.  Not nice :) He and I began to seriously hate each other, 
and our battle continued.

Well, then, I began to like INFERNO.  Flux babe was starting to not 
hate me (we used to have FIGHTS in those days..without the OP, you 
either yelled or squelched :)  All was well.

Then, PegLeg, came up to me one day.  He said &#34;I may not like you 
much, but you want in?&#34;

I said &#34;Is this a joke?&#34;  He said &#34;No.  Are you in?&#34; 
I said okay.  Then, I was INFERNO UO. :)

Well, now, began my great chapter in history.  My, as I call it, 
&#34;The Man days.&#34;

I began by making friends with SnowRabbit, Evil, Anubis, MysticForce, 
and the like.  Cronus was around by now, and he is probably the 
ultimate persona (Fluffy Bunny, eat your heart out :).  Cronus was 
the &#34;cool beans&#34; and he was so good at what he did...making 
useless posts that were so damned good! :)  He is an icon.  (He was 
Sir Lucifer, but oh well :(

Well, next began my &#34;fans.&#34;  My first fan was &#34;the 
KoR.&#34;  These were the Knights of Retribution (Kings of 
Retardation, as BLZ BOBO said. :) (Remember beezlebub (spelling), 
BLZ? :)  Well, we used to spam their channels and make them leave ALL 
time.  I joked that that is why Blizzard made OP's :)

Well, we eventually made them leave, and all was well.  Raistlin, one 
of the older members of INFERNO, was gone by now, and Lightstryder 
was upon us.  It was great. I loved it.

And, next came BLG.  Thus began INFERNO channel spams.  They would 
say &#34;look for combo swords!&#34; and we had to take it.  We got 
about 78 people in their channel once, though :).  Bye now, Janna/Set 
hated me. Oh well. :)

I began to hate cheaters with KoR, and with Black Lotus Guild (Big 
Loser Guys, again by BLZ :) it became an obsession, and I hounded 
them, until they also faded in the shadows.

By now, the mighty guild of Tarot was almost gone, Zodiac was over, 
and all was with the cheats.  And, we still were doing well.  But, 
then the God Mode from players on..and ruined PKing.

Next, ALL these losers came in, challenging us, trying to beat us.  
We held them back, and then more cheats came out, and then a patch.  
By now, Peg was almost disappearing. And UO became priority.

Well, next thing we know, in fighting began in INFERNO.  Mainly Janna 
and me.  And, then OP's.  When you could have more than one OP, we 
always had to be careful.  I came in one day, and who should be there 
but Fusion, with a gavel. I was like &#34;Jesus!&#34; and he told me.

Then, I still liked Sarco by now, but then, he made a fatal move.  He 
made EVERYONE OP's when I made him OP, so now everything was screwed 
up.  Bad for me, and I never forgave myself.  So, we began to hate 
each other.

I banned Sarco from then on, and the rest is him being a racist, etc.

I then began my &#34;fans.&#34;  My first fan was FuknFun!!!, a 
traitor. Tyrael and I caught him, and we made him &#34;pay.&#34;  
THIS is where I got my reputation as a jerk.  I never left him alone 
until he gave up.  He WAS a traitor, and a cheater.  But, we all know 
that. :)

Next came Random, a high talking loser who loved to call me 
&#34;Chuck.&#34;  I don't why :)  He also thought I was in high 
school.  No, man.  But, he gave up, and we ALL knew he cheated.  We 
called him Hogger, and it stuck.  Like a stuck pig :)

Well, bye now, Sexy-Rogue was a memory, and thus began my fan 
&#34;the Godly Soul&#34; which I dubbed &#34;The Paper Tiger.&#34;  
Nice time with him, after he was banned for the rape posts.

I had various others, but they are trivial.  But, that is generally 
how my life went.  Many friends, many enemies...

Then, Anubisan and I began our &#34;Feud.&#34;  I don't why, I 
thought he was just a jerk, but we needed to verbally spar.  And we 
did it so well :)

Well, then, last Friday..it blew up in my face.  I saw those rape 
posts, and I lost my mind and made a petition. It worked. :)

Next, I verbally spared with Anubisan on Monday..Tracy and fist lost 
it, and we were banned from INFERNO. More like kicked.  And I did 
nothing wrong, I wanted peace..but, that is how life goes.

So, I am now out of INFERNO Diablo and UO INFERNO.  But, Bahamut and 
my friend Mikedog are back, and Anubisan HATES to see them in, so I 
am happy :)

Now, for all of those of you demanding my equipment over the months, 
here it is....

&#34;Royal Circlet&#34;  Found with Dennis, nice find.
&#34;Awesome Plate of the Tiger&#34;  Very good, found alone, dropped 
by Gorash.
&#34;Awesome Shielf of the Tiger&#34;  Nice item, Gothic Version :(
&#34;Diamond Ring of the Zodiac&#34;  Hey, plus 20 all, and that 
resist Magic thing :)
&#34;Ring of the Zodiac&#34; Found one night with Dennis, plus 20 
all, nice. :)
&#34;Garnet Amulet of the Zodiac&#34;  Plus 20 all, resist fire about 
45&#37;.  Nice find :)
&#34;And, my sword..the Grandfather&#34;

My Sword, the Grandfather, was my ONLY weapon this whole time.  That 
was all I used as a weapon, the Grandfather, my first unique.  I will 
epxlain how I found it.

I was playing one night as The Man, and had not found a unique yet.  
Was very strange :(.  Well, I eventually made my way to Lazarus..and 
I found what I can only think of as amazing...Arch Bishop Lazarus and 
Red Vex and Black Jade.  I ran around, fought, ran some more (I was a 
level 23 warrior :) and eventually had Lazarus trapped.  I beat him, 
and an item with gold text hit the ground.  A great sword.  
&#34;Damn,&#34; I said, &#34;two handed.&#34;

But, this was MORE than a Great Sword...it was only one handed.  I 
went to town to ID it, and here was the Grandfather.

My Grandfather

&#34;10-20 damage, plus 5 all, plus 20 HP, +70&#37; damage, plus 
20&#37; hit, 179/179 durability (several shrines over time :), One 
handed.&#34;

Well, that was an awesome weapon...and still is.  My first unique 
served me well.

Well, some more about me.  No one realized who I was, so time to go 
into my &#34;personal life&#34;

seemed stacked.

To the haters of INFERNO, remember &#34;RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.&#34;

And to INFERNO themselves...be destined for greatness.

Just watch if I get the stones, I need to keep them now :)

Well, guys, take care, and have fun on B.net for me.  I am now gone, 
maybe things can heal themselves.

To everyone, good night.  And thanks, Blizzard.  But the Man has to 
move on.

Bye, Everyone.  INFERNO, take care.

One little request...if you ever hear the radio and hear the song 
&#34;King of Pain&#34; by The Police, think of me.

And, that is that. :)

The Man (UO-INFERNO) {Charles W. Malette}

&#34;And then came the night after.&#34;

Poscript:  Bye, friends.... :)

P.P.S.  Devin? I will be with you soon. :)</pre>
