<pre>&#34;WHAT???&#34; replied Pepin. Pepin starts examining all of his 
wares closely. Opening up one of his healing potions, he starts 
sniffing it. Not really convinced he sticks his pinky down into 
the bottle and dabs his finger, then bringing it to his lips and 
tasting it. &#34;Well I'll be damned…&#34;,  Pepin mutters. &#34;I 
guess you 
were right about my potions not working. Kind of tastes like 
water now. Nothing to it.&#34;  Pepin then wanders back to his 
shelves and checks each of his potions. &#34;Damn… None of them 
seem to have any affect anymore. Lets go over to see Adria 
and see what she thinks.&#34;  Upon reaching her shed, we rush 
over to her body that's sprawled on the ground.  Pepin 
immediately turns her over to reveal a gaping hole in her chest. 
Examining her closely. &#34;She shouldn't have set up shop here. 
She should have been in town with the rest of us. Now look at 
here. Whoever did this knew what they were doing.&#34;  Bowing 
his head down, tears coming to his eyes &#34;They stole her heart. 
Not even I can resurrect her.&#34; Wandering over to her items, I 
noticed every single one of them were all demolished the 
scrolls and the books were ripped apart and torn to shreds, and 
her staves were shattered and strewn across the ground. &#34;We 
must get back to town and tell everyone what has happened. 
I'll teleport us over to the fountain.&#34; Concentrating on my mana, 
I mumble the secret words to allow transportation between two 
locations. I feel the mana building from within and upon reciting 
the final chant, I brace myself for the spell to take effect and…  
and…. I look around me. Pepin is looking at me expectantly 
awaiting for our transportation to begin and… and… &#34;Shit. It 
looks like it failed. That's odd, never happened to me before. 
Guess I'll try it again.&#34; Once again feeling the mana flow from 
within and from the surrounding air I begin the incantation 
again. As I finish the last syllable and await the impending 
affect of the spell… again… nothing &#34;My spell doesn't seem to 
be working. Let me try phasing us closer to town.&#34; This is 
starting 
to get annoying, thinking to myself. I concentrate on the mana
source within me once more taking hold of Pepin's hand and 
mutter the spell out. As the last syllable dies from my lips, the 
mana vanishes once more leaving us in the same location. 
&#34;This can't be happening! Let me try my other spells.&#34; 
Starting 
down the list, I try to cast each one of them, to no avail.
&#34;My magic doesn't seem to work anymore. Lets get back to town
quickly and see what the hell is going on.&#34;

This is a repost of my first story, which din't even get noticed.
Tell me what you think
