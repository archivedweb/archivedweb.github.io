<pre>    HI folks,
  Well the servers are down...again..err..so I figured I would post 
some info for those of you who are not in the beta...so here goes.

   Well, I started a Thief today. Starting with Stealing,Snooping and 
Lockpicking as skills. Stealing is still a little buggy. Example. 
Stealing used to be too easy, so they made it harder. Now I could not 
even steal a map, in an empty house with no one around and my 
stealing skill was at 42&#37;. Now that is rough.
   Well, to gain some strength and make some money, I went bunny 
hunting. Let me tell you, those little buggers can do some damage to 
you at first, especially if you have NADA for fighting skills. Well, 
when you kill an animal, you can use a bladed weapon to cut it up a 
little. With bunnies you just get some meat, birds also give you 
feathers(for fletchers) and deer and the like give also give you 
hydes and skins. You can sell all of this stuff to who ever will buy 
it.
   Then I made a rather morbid discovery. I found a dead human corpse.
Now you are supposed to be able to chop people up into litte bit 
right down to the brain! So I gave it a try. All I got was more meat, 
just like from the bunnies....so I went and tryed to sell it to 
person I had been selling my bunny meat to....SHE BOUGHT IT!!! 
CANIBALISM IN BRITANNIA....ewwwww...so if you are in Vesper I suggest 
that you don't eat at the Inn on the north side of town(Hotel 
HELL..if anyone remembers that movie..). I suppose one of the skills 
will let you chop people up better and take their heads....speaking 
of heads....
   They have added 'murder for hire' quests. I thought this will be 
cool. So I go walking through town today, right from the start and 
this guy comes running up to me shouting &#34;BLZ BOB&#34; ...ok..So 
I stop..
..Then he asks me to go kill Caroccio and bring him his head.ehehe..
I guess my Diablo reputation has already spread to the NPC's in 
Britannia....well the NPC's seem very found of offering these quests 
now..in fact..that is what most of them offer now....errrr....
   Well, I decided to leave Vesper and head west to Cove. Along the 
way I killed some more bunnies and deer...then 
discovered..encumberance...eheheh...it seems when you have too much 
stuff for your strength that you get fatigued VERY quickly. So I 
dropped the hydes and continued....I was walking along the ocean when 
what did I see.??? A dolphin! Well, he wasn't much of a 
conversationalist...so I killed him...yup..dead flipper!!!
   I then came across a WISP. I have seen these little buggers attack 
Trolls. I tried to talk to it ,since they are fabled to be smarter 
than humans....and it TALKED BACK! it was giberish...but it did reply 
twice...I suppose there is a spell or skill that will allow you to 
understand what it is saying..maybe Spirit Speak would do it like it 
does for ghosts.
   Well, I finally came across Cove. Right outside I found two 
backpacks just sitting there. One was full of fishing poles and the 
other was FULL of fish. I could just barely carry my load plus the 
fish and had to move a little rest..repeat...there is a store right 
in side the gates I was headed for...well I got to the front door of 
the store and....LOST CONNECTION...server went down...errrrrrr..I 
hope it saved after I found the fish. I will be rich when I sell all 
that meat that I have!!!
    I have found some reagents out in the wilds too. Mostly garlic, 
ok alot of garlic, I will sell that too.eheh..to quote daffy duck 
&#34;IM RICH IM RICH...ITS ALL MINE...&#34;....

    Well, finally let me say this. I feel that many people who LOVE 
Diablo will not like UO very much at all. You don't just run to the 
dungeon and kill the monsters. One Mongbat would most likely rip me 
in two right now. UO is a roleplayers dream. It's not a point and 
click fest like Diablo. Let me clarify here. I love Diablo. I have 
had more fun playing that game than just about any other. But, it is 
not a real roleplaying game. It is more of an action game. Granted 
some of us have tried to roleplay it the best we can.8)
    Well, folks I'm off to see if that damn servers are working. If 
anyone has any questions just post them and I will try to answer them 
if I can.
