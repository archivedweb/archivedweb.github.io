<pre>Evening everybody,
	Here is a short story from last nights adventures.  First story that 
will actually be a reminder of old times.
	I was playing a game with a sorcerer and a warrior, neither of which 
had names that I remember.  I was doing a Laz run, and wasn't really 
waiting around for them.  
	I got to 15, killed laz, and picked up the rags he as nice enough to 
drop for me.  The warrior kept telling me to slow down, and wait for 
him.  Guess I wasn't in a very nice mood, because I teleported all 
around 15 until I found Bloodlust.  
	After getting the buckler she dropped I teleported over to the 
pentagram.  Here is where the story gets embarrassing.   I switched 
plates to my Naj's plate.  Figuring the higher resistance, and higher 
spell level was what I would want fighting all the advocates on level 
16.
	I guess I underestimated what the drop in AC would do when 
teleporting into the middle of about 15 nightmare Knights.  They had 
me stunned, so I couldn't teleport, that didn't stop me from trying 
to teleport, and drinking all my potions while I waited. 
	I restarted in town, and Id'd everything.  By this time they had 
both found their way to level 16.  I mentioned that I had died 
because my AC was too low.  I didn't think much of it as I switched 
plated back, and took the portal that they had so kindly provided for 
me.
	Well, I walked over to them, and the Sorcerer dropped a GPOW.  He 
said &#34;Use that, it will help you on these levels.&#34;
	I stopped short and said &#34;That is a GPOW.&#34; Just the simple 
statement, like saying the sky is blue.  I then said to the Warrior, 
&#34;Are you wearing one of those too?&#34;
	The warrior said &#34;Yes&#34;, so I walked slowly over to the 
Plate.  Which just so happened to be right between the other 2 
players.
	I opened my inventory screen, and switched plates once again, Naj's 
absorbs fireballs better than the saintly plate, and I thought they 
might fight back.
	Then I started shooting fireballs, first at the sorcerer, and then 
at the Warrior.  It was all over in 10 seconds, the warrior took a 
little longer to die because I had to shoot fireballs at him as he 
was running around.
	Both the bodies disappeared, I picked up the GPOW and walked over to 
the portal.  Sure enough one of them was already on their way back 
down.  I waited for him to put up his mana shield, then started 
shooting fireballs at him.  This time he managed to get a few of his 
own off but, sadly, it still wasn't much of a challenge for my 18th 
level fireballs and max resistance.
	I had about 5 mana potions left still at this point, so I switched 
plates again and teleported into Diablo's chamber.  I didn't think I 
would last very long, and I was pretty sure I was going to die when 4 
of the potions went into about 7  knights surrounding me.
	I used my last potion, and was shooting at Diablo himself at this 
point.  I had pretty much given up, and my mana shield was about to 
drop, when my last fireball went off.  My mana shield went down, and 
one knight got in a shot that lowered my hitpoints a little, at the 
same instant Diablo started spurting.
	I was feeling great about myself as I went back to the chatrooms.  
That joyous feeling lasted about 10 seconds, before I realized that I 
had left my extra rings, and all my money hidden in that game.  
	Oh well, I never have claimed to be the smartest Sorcerer on the 
net. See you online.
