&#62; As you may or may not know I have been talking to some friends in 
&#62; Tarot and I may become apart of that guild. 
&#62; 
&#62; I had a nice chat with Braveheart last night and so far the guild 
&#62; rules sound like things I can live with. As most of you who know me 
&#62; know, I have had little interest in joining a guild since mine went 
&#62; the way of the Do-Do. But I think it would bring a little interest 
&#62; back into this game for me if I started being a little more social.
&#62; 
&#62; Just because I think its kind of funny how these things happen 
&#62; sometimes I'd like to tell you my view of it. 
&#62; 
&#62; I was talking to Zaphod about Tarot, mainly because I used to be 
&#62; pretty close to some of the members and I wanted to know how the 
&#62; guild was doing. The curiosity was based on the fact that I hadn't 
&#62; seen much from Tarot members on this forum and didn't know how they 
&#62; were doing. I saw a link to their webpage and so I went and checked 
&#62; it out. The first thing you see when you get there if the &#34;King 
&#62; of Wands&#34;, I about fell out. You just have to see it for 
&#62; yourself,   <a href="http://athena.3-cities.com/~tarot/index.html">http://athena.3-cities.com/~tarot/index.html</a> (Yaz, you 
&#62; put together a nice page my friend.)  
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, I started poking around and I noticed that Death was 
&#62; represented in the major arcana. I knew Tarot was an anti-PK guild so 
&#62; I started wondering if a PK would be allowed in if they held the 
&#62; office of Death. So I shot off an email to Zaphod asking about it. I 
&#62; think Zaphod took the question as a petition to join and ran with it. 
&#62; Not that I minded in the least, as close as I am to Snakegod members 
&#62; I just never wanted to join Snakegod, I love some of the people who 
&#62; have, but I knew they didn't allow PK's to join. At least not 
&#62; practicing PK's. &#60;Nod to my bud Kariyafan&#62; And I have liked 
&#62; the idea of Tarot since way back, a guild whose offices are fashioned 
&#62; from the cards in a Tarot deck. I thought that was a damn original 
&#62; idea and very appropriate for this game. And besides, if they can 
&#62; teach Valaska to cook, they can't be all bad. 
&#62; 
&#62; So anyway, the next thing I knew I was getting introduced to 
&#62; Braveheart, Emperor of Tarot. Very cool person that drinks very good 
&#62; beer.  O;) 
&#62; So we talked awhile and he laid down the laws of Tarot for me and I 
&#62; asked a couple questions and eventually I asked him one he said he 
&#62; would need to talk to the rest of Tarot about before he answered. 
&#62; 
&#62; So thats where we are folks, I have decided I would be very honored 
&#62; to hold the office of Death within Tarot if they will have me.  
&#62; Depending on what Braveheart has to say when next we meet you may be 
&#62; addressing me as CudaPrime Member of Tarot Keeper of the Office of 
&#62; Death.  (Ever read any Piers Anthony?)  O;)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; OK, now for something completely different! 
&#62; 
&#62;  -=|)elfontes=-. What the heck is up with this |)el, petitioning PoC? 
&#62; I hear they are all legit and PK like mad. Well, this does sound 
&#62; interesting, at least I know there will be some PK's out there not 
&#62; using GM I can go after. And I know Delfontes PK's, but I thought he 
&#62; went after cheaters only. Whats up bud? Give me a shout and let me 
&#62; know.
&#62; 
&#62; And who can tell me what PoC is about? I know some of the members, 
&#62; BLZ, Tracy, Sarco, but I haven't heard from any of em. I obviously am 
&#62; going to have to scroll back a few pages of the tavern and see what's 
&#62; what. Unless someone would like to enlighten me... Please!  O;)
&#62; 
&#62; Thats all folks!
&#62; 
&#62; Have Fun!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;        Cuda       O;)
&#62; 

Hey Cuda, PoC was formed by mostly by Inferno members who were 
dissastisfied with the organization and perhaps somewhat 
&#34;tarnished&#34; reputation regarding being completely legit..but 
I'm sure they can speak for themselves. If you ever want to check out 
some truly legit pk's, look no further than the Triad..
