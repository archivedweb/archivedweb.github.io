&#62; it's no secret that TheMan was kicked out of (OLD) Inferno for his 
&#62; powerhunger... Now he is getting kicked for SAME exactly thing from 
&#62; NEW Inferno... cool.... and Haplo? Forget it loser... I was on 
&#62; tonight and tested freshbought Nova staff.... well what can I say? 
&#62; With level 20 Nova does about 60 damage MAX.. So..... Ya... u sure 
&#62; been losing legit duel badly if you had to make such sorry excuse as 
&#62; Nova... try not to cheat in duels.. u are in Inferno now not in KoR.. 
&#62; or at least if you do cheat do not invite nonpartial Referee... 
&#62; Because... it's sucks to be a loser and a cheater at same time....  
&#62; Yup.. TheMan? U are Inferno history.... I heard ALOT of threats from 
&#62; YOU and I never was actually affected at any way.....Flux is far more 
&#62; scary then your sorry ass.. and she does duel by the way....Take care 
&#62; pathetic chapter in history of Inferno.. and YES.. u can try to split 
&#62; Inferno even more.... if ALL u want is power and asskissers
&#62; P.S. Flux? Go on... And who made Haplo To by the way?
&#62; P.P.S. If I again hear from TheMan responce on message I said NO 
&#62; responce from TheMan I am going to hunt him down in UO and make his 
&#62; head roll... Yes.. it's a threat.. I do not make threats which I 
&#62; can't back up... and TheMan? U mess with ME u gonna go begging around 
&#62; as U did after I threw your pathetic ass from Inferno U remeber that? 
&#62; I never seen anybody quite so sorry and funny.. I even had a pity for 
&#62; you.... u was sooooo pityfull and selfhumiliating.. &#34;Ohh 
&#62; pleeaassee let me back in! I didn't do anything.. pleeaaasseee&#34; U 
&#62; wanna do it again? har har har har... I can make it... U know it..
&#62; P.P.P.S. haplo? Get some brains.... and remeber any bull who messes 
&#62; with me ends up as a BBQ!

You ever notice you have more periods in your statement than regular 
characters?  Just thought I'd clear that up.</pre>
