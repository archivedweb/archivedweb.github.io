<pre>Dark_Lord i am very sorry i playerkilled u that day it was the many 
more dumb mistake's i could have done to make my situation worse with 
the Crimson Rose i hope u take my apology into consideration and i 
would like to apologize to the whole guild even though they hate me 
very much :(  i just dont now were to start i haven't been using 
LordMayhem lately cause i keep getting killed everywere i go so i 
have made numerous character's and they are very high level's i also 
avoid using LordMayhem  since if someone does a whois on me they will 
find out my new # since i now how to change it everynow and then so 
now one can track me as my new character and new # preety slick but i 
dont think it will last long but like i said i am sorry guild of The 
Crimson Rose for my undignified behavior and would like to make peace 
at least to not player kill me and oh yeah by the way the reason i 
changed my name to LordMayhem was there was like 2 clones i ran into 
who copyied my name as Mayhem only and i was mad as hell for that !!! 
I was the originater of the name and people stole it i hope no one 
clones this one or i will have to change it again! Dam clones and 
sorry about cloning u Ðantrag and kicking out members out or u'r old 
channel i just used him that day for the hell of it to piss people 
off only to find out i made things worse with u guys and to hate me 
more i still respect the people i knew in the guild exept for 
Apocolypse for calling me a cheater that night we dueled and Arakus 
was there he said cause his fireball was a level 9 and mine at the 
time 8 he should have won but he had no resistance which he told me 
about earleir on so my fireball got the best out of him and my 
teleport just was better and got the best out of him to and called me 
a cheater i am one of the few legit player's still out there and i'am 
no god moder dam cheating bast**d if i was i would have not been in 
the great guild of The Crimson Rose which was my pride an joy i just 
made a mistake everyone makes mistakes but i may add i made to many 
and since it is mid-evil times there was no second chance although i 
was given one to get back in the guild but to be striped of my combat 
gear no way unless i would  have had back up back then now i do but o 
well i made another boo boo  and dearly miss it well i'am off in the 
mist of the shadow's off to play on battle net as usallal i play 24-7 
when i get the chance i do hope Crimson Rose exepts my apology and u 
too Dark_Lord i hope u forgive me for my hanus crime thank u and i 
hope u or the guild or Ðantrag reads this and stop player killing me </pre>
