&#60;SNIP SOME STUFF&#62;
&#62; To have a &#34;gated community&#34; one must first pay for a fence, a 
&#62; gate, and a fulltime security guard. Blizzard did not believe that 
&#62; building such would be profitable so they didn't.

True.  Course, I don't live in a gated community, but we've got a 
block watch, and a real nice police force that comes when they're 
called ...
 
&#62; Many online services/games have a 
&#62; model whereby well-behaved concerned citizens such as yourself ...
&#62; can volunteer your 
&#62; time to help support and/or police the community. 

Not a bad idea, Crys.  I'd be glad to volunteer an hour or two a week 
to monitor this board (though that would mean I'd have to read 
*everything* here, a most unappetizing idea), and I'm sure there are 
a lot of other trustworthy community members of long-standing who 
would also volunteer to help out.  

One of the hallmarks of a community is some shared definition of what 
is acceptable behaviour.  The recent tasteless posts have crossed 
that line into the unacceptable, and it's a shame that Blizzard 
doesn't have someone minding the store here (paid employee or 
volunteer) who could simply blast that garbage off the board before 
reply number one could've been posted.  As it is now, the offending 
post has a looooong tail of responses.  As we've seen from the 
behavior of other denizens here, that will no doubt serve as 
encouragement for more of the same.  

&#62; In the meantime, to brighten an otherwise sour post, I'd like to say 
&#62; how much I appreciate those who are *still* hanging out on the forum 
&#62; and bnet psuedo-public rooms trying to stem the tide. Online 
&#62; communities are here to stay, and you will eventually triumph 
&#62; (remember that the wild wild west [hmm, that spells www, doesn't it?] 
&#62; was once a pretty rough place but now everyone peacefully stays at 
&#62; home and watches TV or surfs the internet ;-)

How true.  Until this comes to pass, for those who share the 
sentiments of the other respondents, do as BLZ_BOB, myself, and 
others have, and simply begin ignoring these cretins.  Restrain 
yourself from dignifying their garbage with a response.  Shun them. I 
know it's hard to not deal them a sharp verbal slap, but do restrain 
yourselves.  If they stop getting responses, eventually they'll tire 
of this, and take their verbal excreta elsewhere.

&#62; Life goes on,
&#62; Crystalion

It sure does, Crys.  See you 19:00 GMT!
