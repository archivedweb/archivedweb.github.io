&#62; TheMan made a petition yesterday (or the day before) to get rid of 
&#62; some members of INFERNO.  He claimed later that the petitition was a 
&#62; success.  However if you look back to the bottom of post section 3.  
&#62; (may change as more is added.)  You will notice that the posts on 
&#62; this petition were all about him.  Only one post responded to him.  
&#62; The others joined me in wanting to get rid of TheMan.  
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with TheMan.  We can't get rid of you.  But we can use our 
&#62; brains and acknowledge the fact that you are someone that shouldn't 
&#62; be listened to.  Everyone in INFERNO needs to realize that if TheMan 
&#62; is allowed to be a member of this guild he will cause chaos in the 
&#62; upcoming onlice game Ultima Online.  
&#62; 
&#62; Can you imagine the tricks he will pull in this new game?  I don't 
&#62; want to see it happen!  TheMan is only out to destroy INFERNO.  Why 
&#62; can't you people see that?  
&#62; 
&#62; Thankyou for reading this message.  Feel free to post your support.

Were ANY of those people INFERNO?  No, including you. :)

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.  I only answer 
to INFERNO, Blizzard, and God.  And you don't hit any of those 
catagories, Sir.

So, Blizzard is being hardheaded.  I can take care of that with a 
phone call.

You, Sir.Ving, the other night, begged me to stop harassing people.  
Harass?  Hehe, if you call my what I do harassment, so be it.

Besides, Sir.Ving, the only people who really hate me want to be in 
INFERNO and are not good enough. So, what else is there to say?

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

&#34;What can I say?  I'm a jerk.&#34;</pre>
