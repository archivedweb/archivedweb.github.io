<pre>“WHERE IS THAT SCUM DARKAND GLOOMYNAME!” boomed a voice from above. A 
few townsmen scurried away in terror.

“Oh no! I recognize that voice” cringed YukYuk, “Its Sir CheatsAlot 
and he is going to add our ears to his collection”.

“SEND ME A PORTAL! NOW! I AM GROWING IMPATIENT” boomed Sir CheatsAlot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 3

‘Why should we send you a portal, when you will only come down and 
kill us?’ shouted Darkand up through the air shaft.

‘WELL PUNY MORTALS, I CAN ALWAYS JUST STAY HERE AND KILL YOU HERE IN 
TOWN OR STRIKE YOU DOWN FROM WHERE I STAND WITH MY AUTOKILL CHEAT!!! 
SEND THE PORTAL NOW!! SIR CHEATSALOT HAS SPOKEN!!’

‘Doesn’t look like we have much choice do we?’ asked Darkand.

YukYuk nodded, and cast the portal spell. Within a  matter of moments 
a mage pushing a large wheelbarrow arrived.

‘NOW STRIP EVERYTHING OFF AND PLACE IT IN THIS WHEELBARROW, THEN SING 
A HYMN IN MY HONOR, AND THEN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FACE THE WALL’ 
boomed Sir Cheatsalot.

‘Why do you use a wheelbarrow?’ asked Darkand.

‘MY EGO OCCUPIES ALL MY SPACE IN INVENTORY’ replied Sir Cheatsalot.

‘What cheats do you have?’ asked Darkand.

A whistfull expression lit up on Sir Cheatsalot’s face. ‘TOWNKILL, 
GHOST, TOWNKILL, UNLIMITED BELT.....’  

‘Do you have the Virus cheat yet?’ asked Darkand.

“VIRUS?” demanded Sir Cheatsalot.

‘Yes its rather clever. When you turn it on, any object you lose to 
pk becomes a virus carrier and which reformats the hard drive of the 
killer. Its really good. I am running it now. Can you tell? Want to 
see it in action? Here let me show you, first I need to toggle my 
posture to...’

*Sir_Cheatsalot (99) has left the game*

‘Quick thinking, Darkand’ said Yuk Yuk, ‘I thought we were dead’.

‘Yeah, well he lifted the idea from an Ogdens tavern post. Why just 
the other day I read the same thing there’ said the Narrator.

‘I did not. Really. Its original. Hey, whats that huge list you have 
there?’ asked Darkand.

‘Oh, its just a survey of sorts. The latest rage at the tavern is to 
post huge surveys and see how much of the tavern wall you can cover 
with responses. My survey is a “List of your top 10 favorite 
surveys”, stated the Narrator. ‘I hope to get at least 50 responses, 
and by sheer volume become the most acclaimed in the Tavern. From 
there I will repost it on another forum, and then another to roll on 
and on until...’.

‘Look, if you could pry yourself away from that metadrivel, could you 
narrate us out of this Mobius strip and into a decent plotline?’ 
asked Yuk Yuk.

‘There is no need to be snotty,’ huffed the Narrator in an injured 
tone.

*DeathMorteKillKill(5) has entered the game*
*Undertaker(4) has entered the game*

‘Where are you guys? Does this portal go down to you?’ asked 
Deathmorte.

‘Hey could you sent me a portal?’ asked Undertaker.

‘I have a bad feeling about these guys’ whispered Yuk Yuk.

‘Me too’ replied Darkand. “Hey you guys aren’t killers are 
you?”shouted Darkand.

‘Nah, we love cooperative games’ replied Deathmortekillkill.

‘Certainly not!’ shouted Undertaker.

As Darkand began to cast portal, the world slowed down  and stopped, 
then went black. 

Darkand: Where are we?
YukYuk: I dont know.
Narrator: Diablo Retail USA-9. Its a chat room of sorts, where you 
can meet everyone else.”
