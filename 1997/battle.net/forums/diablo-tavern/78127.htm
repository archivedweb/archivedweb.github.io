<pre>   Well, last night I got very bored waitin for some people to come 
and talk  in the INFERON room so I decided to go Newbi Kill.  I had 
been to about 5 or 10 different games and had collected about 13 or 
14 ears.  When I saw the game &#34;Co-Op in Church&#34; I just had to 
join. Well I joined and there was a full party now.  I started to 
walk down to lvl 1 and 2 of the people left.  So I went into the 
church and started to walk around looking for my next victim.  And I 
had found him.  He was a mage.  I had thought to my self &#34;This is 
going to be easy&#34;.  I started to walk around with with him for 
about 3 or 4 minutes.  Thans when I unleashed my Trusty Flail.  It 
had been a sucess, I had killed him and res'ed him about 4 or 5 
times. Well he finally got smart enught to just restart in town.  So 
I went up to town and laughed in his face. He then of course stated 
to tell me to shut up. This is where it gets funny.  He then said 
&#34;I am reporting you to Blizzard, I have your account number&#34; 
And I said haha. He then said &#34;I have already got Blizzard to ban 
3 or 4 people from B.Net&#34;  I thought to my self that this guy was 
a nut and he did not know what he was talking to my self.  After 
arguing he then says &#34;Since you keep arguing, Im going to resolve 
your Host and Find out where you live. And when I find out where you 
live, I'm going to get a gang to kill you&#34; I started to laugh my 
A$$ off. I was like &#34;You go ahead and do that&#34;. He said 
something like he will.. I could barley type I was laughing so hard! 
     This was just to show you that there are some pretty stupid 
people on B.Net who dont know what they are talking about. They just 
get so mad becuase they get killed. HA! I just had to share this with 
ya guys! Hoped you guys enjoyed. Cya Later.
