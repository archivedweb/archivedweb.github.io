&#62; &#62; OK, let me just cut to the chase. I think it has been established 
&#62; &#62; that at level 49, you get 10,000 exp per kill. If I'm not mistakem, 
&#62; &#62; it has also been pointed out that the experience needed to jump from 
&#62; &#62; 49 to 50 is 1.3 billion. In addition, most observers seem to believe 
&#62; &#62; that The Man jumped levels in a two week period, three weeks at most. 
&#62; &#62; I will use a THREE week period, just to give The Man the benefit of 
&#62; &#62; the doubt. The Man himself has stated that he played approximately 8 
&#62; &#62; hours per day over this period. So, how many kills must he make?  1.3 
&#62; &#62; billion divided by 10000, which is 130,000. He must do this over a 
&#62; &#62; three week period playing 8 hours a day. Twenty one days times 8 
&#62; &#62; hours equals 168 hours. One hundred thirty thousand kills divided by 
&#62; &#62; one hundred sixty eight hours equals approximately 770 kills per 
&#62; &#62; hour. In one hour there are 3600 seconds (60 min x 60 sec)...3600 
&#62; &#62; divided by 770 equals 4.67. That means that in order to gain the 
&#62; &#62; necessary experience to gain level 50 over a three week period, 
&#62; &#62; playing 8 hours a day, you must kill one monster every 4.67 seconds. 
&#62; &#62; The Man was using a warrior, and of course he was playing hell hell. 
&#62; &#62; I am not really experienced with a warrior, and neither am I close to 
&#62; &#62; level 50, so I will leave it up to the readers of this forum to 
&#62; &#62; comment on the probabilty of this being done....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Is the big duel still on for tonight at 10:00 central time? Heheh
&#62; &#62; Please reply, Ogden's readers!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Oh yeah, one other thing...some loser cheat claims to have cloned all 
&#62; &#62; of the Triad members, and also claims that he will hack account 
&#62; &#62; numbers so that our clones will have the same account numbers a s the 
&#62; &#62; real deal..is all of this possible? If so, please keep in mind that 
&#62; &#62; you may meet a clone of a Triad, and I'm quite sure he will probably 
&#62; &#62; cheat and be rude to boot...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Westsdstrangler (The Triad)
&#62; 
&#62; Whoops! I never thought I'd say this to that lyin' sack of goo TheMan 
&#62; (he falsely accused the Triad of cheating), but sorry! I did the 
&#62; above post hastily while eating lunch at work...the correct amount of 
&#62; experience required to get from level 49 to level 50 is apparently 
&#62; about 220 million I think. So lets redo the math. 220 million divided 
&#62; by the 10000 exp. you apparently get per kill in hell hell once being 
&#62; level 49 equals 22,000 kills necessary to gain level 50. Playing 
&#62; three weeks for eight hours a day, seven days a week is a total of 
&#62; 168 hours of playing. 22000 divided by 168 equals approximately 131 
&#62; kills per hour necessary. 3600 seconds per hour divided by 131 kills 
&#62; per hour equals approximately one kill every 27 seconds. So if TheMan 
&#62; killed one monster every 27 seconds, eight hours a day, seven days a 
&#62; week, for three weeks, he could go from level 49 to level 50. Of 
&#62; course, keep in mind that much time will be spent going to town for 
&#62; potions, etc. and this is assuming that no &#34;breaks&#34; are taken 
&#62; etc...maybe now some of the hardened veteran warriors of bnet can 
&#62; comment on the likelihood of TheMan doing this...
&#62; 
&#62; For myself, all I can say is that TheMan has been caught in lies 
&#62; multiple times in this forum before..in fact, the first time I recall 
&#62; seeing him speaking in chat rooms was quite a while ago when he was 
&#62; jumping from channel to channel telling everyone who would listen 
&#62; that Inferno had disbanded..this was right around the time he got 
&#62; kicked out...at the time, of course, this was simply a lie. So 
&#62; whether or not TheMan has indeed been absent from chat channels long 
&#62; enough to have actually gained level 50 legitly (and if he has, then 
&#62; congratulations), it does not change the fact that he is a low class 
&#62; bald faced liar...'nuff said.
