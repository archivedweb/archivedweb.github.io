<blockquote>
<pre>An interesting question and one I wrestled with as I created my first 
multiplayer character, a warrior called WinterMute. My plan was to 
legitimately build him up by playing in public b.net games, despite 
all the problems that we know exist in that arena. I realised pretty 
soon that it wasn't straightforward to be fully 'legit'.

Problem 1: receiving gifts. This is the problem you've identified. 
Unless you can GUARANTEE that the item you've been given is not 
hacked, duped etc, then by receiving the item, you've potentially 
compromised your legitimacy. But how can you get that guarantee? A 
certificate of authenticity would be nice :-)

My solution: to not receive gifts. I know this is a purist appoach, 
and that some of the items that were offered came from players who 
were unlikely to be cheaters. But I couldn't be sure, and anyway, 
they in turn might have got given the item from someone who WAS a 
cheater. 
So far so good...

Problem 2: stealing gold. Is it legitimate to steal gold that people 
have left lying around, when you cant guarantee that the gold hasn't 
been obtained by selling hacked items?

My solution: well, to start with, after WinterMute had been mkilled a 
few times by god-moded cheaters, I got fed up with having to restart 
the hunt for enough gold to replace my equipment. So I'd steal what I 
saw lying around, or would take the gold that was given to me. 

I didn't realise at the time, but the cracks in my character's legit 
status were now starting to appear...

Problem 3: selling duped stuff. Is it legitimate to benefit from the 
proceeds of someone else's duping?

My solution: again, I used this technique shamelessly to recover 
enough gold to buy equipment that had been lost after being mkilled 
by godmode cheats. 

The cracks widen...

Problem 4: being helped by non-pk cheaters. I had a few games with 
non-pking cheats, in which I benefited from their strengths, e.g. 
they'd soften up monsters which I would kill and take the gold/items. 
When I died, they res-ed me, etc. 

My solution: I figured because I hadn't directly cheated I was OK. 
But if you consider the amount of benefit I was getting from someone 
else's cheating, it was pretty obvious that I was at least 
'indirectly' cheating. 

Anyway, the upshot of it all was that I'd been kidding myself about 
how 'pure' my character was, and so I killed him. If I'm going to try 
this '110&#37; legit' approach again, then my character will play in 
solo multiplayer games (an oxymoron!) or in guild games with others 
that can be trusted. I can't see any other way really.

The other option is to be less strict with the interpretation of 
'legit', and permit the benefitting from other's illegitimacy. As 
other posts on this subject have said, it comes down to personal 
opinion. Just as long as we are aware that, thanks to cheaters, 
trying to 'do the right thing' is not always simple or obvious.

What do others think?
