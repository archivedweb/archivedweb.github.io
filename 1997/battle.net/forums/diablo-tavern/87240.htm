&#62; I am not going to apologize to quitters.
&#62; 
&#62; PoC, I am growing tired.
&#62; 
&#62; Tracy, we can duel, arrange a time sometime Friday, I am busy the 
&#62; rest of the week.  That is, if you don't chicken out. :)  I mean, you 
&#62; are PoC...how good can you be?
&#62; 
&#62; And, to PoC....
&#62; 
&#62; NO offense, but I am angry at quitters who quit and then expect the 
&#62; guild they left to be friendly.
&#62; 
&#62; And, I am requesting to INFERNO to have you guys banned from the 
&#62; channel.  Because of one person.
&#62; 
&#62; Pyro forced Fusion to quit.  And Pyro?  I may duel you..when you get 
&#62; good, and when you can talk without sounding like white trash in 
&#62; every word you say.  
&#62; 
&#62; So, I say this for PoC...
&#62; 
&#62; You guys can act all tough and big, but I still see right through 
&#62; you. You are all 13-17 year old kids trying to be big.
&#62; 
&#62; So, PoC, you guys can stay out of INFERNO's way, period.  
&#62; 
&#62; But, TO make decisions in INFERNO, so they are the ones to decide.
&#62; 
&#62; And to the PoC who call me a pussy, I may have cared, but you guys 
&#62; are just chopped liver also rans.  Shlonglor's Barbarians could beat 
&#62; you guys.
&#62; 
&#62; And Tracy?  Duel me on Friday. No ref.  If there is a ref, then just 
&#62; forget about it.  That way, we can settle it between us.
&#62; 
&#62; And to Elijah and the other ilk, you guys can TRY and get me in UO.  
&#62; I just hope for your sakes I don't have some &#34;advantage,&#34; 
&#62; like stones. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Because this is not a threat to PoC.  Nor a Warning.
&#62; 
&#62; This is a promise.
&#62; 
&#62; You stay away from INFERNO, and get lost.  And if you do not....
&#62; 
&#62; Then I may need to stop being as kind to you as I have been.
&#62; 
&#62; And SnowRabbit?  When you officially stop being a coward and come 
&#62; back, we can talk.
&#62; 
&#62; And now, I am off to gain the last two million experience and become 
&#62; level 50.
&#62; 
&#62; See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Flux?  Say one word about this....I dare you.


The Man, you have the worst sense of humor in the world....

&#34;See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.&#34; 

How lame.    

Tracy, you had better take a TON of screen shots of you standing over 
The Man's dead body.  E-mail me a few too.

You call me a coward?  Let's compare:

SnowRabbit: pks many morons and accepts almost every challenge to 
duel.
The Man: is a moron with grandmother sword and runs away from every 
duel.

*yawn*  Every post i write about you asks the same questions.  Every 
time you respond by ignoring my questions or making up some other 
lies.   

&#34;...i can pk with grandmother sword because i have skills...&#34;

Yeah right.  Try again.  Doesn't matter what skills you got the 
Grandmother sword is always gonna suck.

I can't wait tell your back on the street after flux kicks you.  KICK 
HIM FOR LIFE FLUX!  (He makes INFERNO look like idiots.)

Flux?  Ask yourself, what good has The Man ever done for you?

Think about it.....

Later,
Tibbar-Wons
Animal of Laughter

P.S.  I am taking a break from diablo, not running away.  You are the 
last person i'd ever run from.

&#34;Bahahahahahahahahahahaha...&#34;</pre>
