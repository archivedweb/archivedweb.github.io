<pre>Boy, go away for a week, and all Hell breaks loose . . . Inferno 
disintegrates, Blz_Bob actually joins a guild/clan/commune, and 
Ridcully's clones almost start a clan war!  Glad to see that the 
&#34;eternal&#34; topics of cheating and PKing are still around, 
otherwise this forum wouldn't feel like home.

CM, you have taken a very interesting approach by asking the 
question, &#34;What if cheating didn't exist?&#34;   I agree that the 
biggest effect would be the number and quality of items possessed by 
players, which would not have duped and hacked items available.  The 
critical question is how people would respond to the scarcity of good 
items.  
In general, I see two responses.  First, the person could just 
continue on with what they have, trade for, or find.  These people 
now are probably legit co-opers, and there would not be much 
difference in their pattern of play.  Unfortunately (from my point of 
view), these people seem to be in the minority.

The second response is to try to obtain items from other players by 
theft or MKing (assuming that you don't consider MKing to be a 
&#34;cheat&#34; that would be removed with the other cheats).  
Current PKers and MKers (both &#34;legits&#34; and 
&#34;cheaters&#34;) presumably all would fall into this group (the 
only difference between the current state of affairs and your 
hypothetical is that there is no legit/cheat distinction in the 
latter).  

This leaves the mass of cheaters of various types.  My guess is that 
since people who currently cheat have already demonstrated their 
willingness to &#34;cheat&#34; to gain high-end items, etc., that 
these same people also would be willing to go after other players to 
obtain high end items.  (A possible exception might be those who 
genuinely use the god-mode cheat or other cheats to protect 
themselves from PKers--these folks likely would retreat to private or 
clan games.)

PKing/MKing thus would become even more of a problem than it 
currently is in public games.  It seems likely that there are more 
non-PKing people playing in public games now than there would be if 
there were no cheats.  You allude to an interesting analogy between 
&#34;cheats&#34; and handguns--I can see your viewpoint of cheats as 
the &#34;great equalizer.&#34;

I base this in part on my own reasons for playing in private games.  
I joined not so much to avoid cheats as to avoid other more obnoxious 
behavior by PKers and MKers.  Like you, I have played with people I 
later found out were &#34;cheats&#34; (dupers, actually), and as long 
as I didn't take any of their duped items, I had fun playing with 
them.

Just my initial reaction to your post.  I'll give it some more 
thought.

&#62; Title: Diablo, Alternate Reality
&#62; 
&#62; Author: -=/ Code Myster /=-
&#62; 
&#62; Purpose: Make people think about Diablo and it's current state.
&#62; 
&#62; Expected Result: hopefully this post will get a few &#34;I agree 
&#62; because...&#34; or &#34;I disagree because...&#34; or even a 
&#62; &#34;Interesting (NT)&#34; replies.
&#62; 
&#62; Distribution: this will be cross posted to both Tavern and Stragety.
&#62; 
&#62; Thesis: Had Cheating not existed in Diablo, alot of the same problems 
&#62; would still exist.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok I have been thinking alot about this lately with all the endless 
&#62; complaining about the Cheating that has been going on in Diablo and 
&#62; how it has ruined the game. GPOW, KSOH, 255 Apoc staffs, Windforces, 
&#62; OZ's are all common place now. The question I asked myself and am 
&#62; presenting today is this: &#34;Are we worse off with cheating than if 
&#62; it hadn't existed?&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62; Let's explore this. Let's assume for a moment that absolutely *NO* 
&#62; cheating had taken place in Diablo. No dups, hacks, cheats etc. 
&#62; Diablo existed EXACTLY as it was planned by Blizzard.
&#62; 
&#62; Now with this base assumption, lets look at the results of what 
&#62; Diablo would be like now. As for items, most people would have lots 
&#62; of misc jewlery... as OZ's are hard to find, owning one would be a 
&#62; little rare with Heavens jewelery being more common place. Most 
&#62; higher level people would problibly have some form of Awesome Plate 
&#62; Armor as it gets offered at Griz from time to time. It would be rare, 
&#62; but some people would also have forms of Godly items etc.
&#62; 
&#62; Trading would be a huge part of Diablo. Higher level people would of 
&#62; course, be finding better items and trading them off to the lower 
&#62; level people while trying to &#34;trade up&#34; in items they use. As 
&#62; items wear out (Diablo's Apoc spell lowers Items Dur if anyone doesnt 
&#62; know), there would also be a need to replace the items.
&#62; 
&#62; In the end, most people would hit a &#34;platue&#34; with respect to 
&#62; items stoping at Awsome Plate and Jade/Heavens jewelery.
&#62; 
&#62; Here is where I see a difference. In the quest to &#34;better&#34; a 
&#62; players char, stealing would become very frequent as people 
&#62; frustrated they cannot find greater items on their own, would result 
&#62; to stealing. This would cause those with the great items to be very 
&#62; selective on thier trading and limit the number of items traded.
&#62; 
&#62; As people became scared of trading due to &#34;stealing&#34;, the 
&#62; thieves would result to another tactic, one that works against people 
&#62; who have no wish to trade.... MKill.
&#62; 
&#62; I think Mkilling would become the dominant method to &#34;gain&#34; 
&#62; items for alot of people. Someone would enter a game with 300+ HP's 
&#62; and everyone else would immediatly begin plotting on how to MK him 
&#62; and get his stuff. 
&#62; 
&#62; As MKilling became more and more rampant, people frustrated with all 
&#62; the stealing and Mkilling going on and would result to joining Guilds 
&#62; and playing in private games. Public games would be just too 
&#62; dangerous to play in.
&#62; 
&#62; Summary: Blizzards Diablo has broken new ground. It has brought up 
&#62; new questions that are VERY hard to answer. Game Ethics are now at 
&#62; the heart of alot of most game discussions and game designs now.
&#62; 
&#62; Games such as UO are going to be constantly monitored to force 
&#62; players to play the game as intended allowing less &#34;freedom&#34; 
&#62; to the individual players.
&#62; 
&#62; As for the current state of Diablo, Cheating has made everyone 
&#62; &#34;equal&#34;. There is no need to kill others unless you are 
&#62; either PK or PK hunter. 
&#62; 
&#62; Now, people stay out of public games for 2 reasons. #1 is that they 
&#62; wish to avoid PK's. #2 is that they wish to avoid &#34;cheaters&#34;. 
&#62; Had Diablo existed &#34;cheat free&#34;, everyone would still be 
&#62; avoiding public games because of a more serious threat, the threat of 
&#62; getting MK'ed and losing everything they own.
&#62; 
&#62; Which Diablo would be better? I do not know... if I had to answer, I 
&#62; would take Diablo in it's current state than this senario I have 
&#62; presented. I have played with alot of cheaters, most have been very 
&#62; fun to play with. I have also played with PK's.... not a single one 
&#62; of them has been at all &#34;fun&#34;. 
&#62; 
&#62; You will have to answer this question for yourself.
