<pre>I don't know if this gets stressed enough.  I've seen way too many 
people/clans saying these things.

In this message he states &#34;We do not condone cheating, but our 
members are allowed to use cheats and hacks...&#34;  Lepthana points 
this out, but does not stress the logic (or lack thereof) in the 
statement.

So let me stress:
If you allow members of your clan/guild/free association to use 
hacks, cheats, and other nonsense, then your guild condones cheating. 
 Yes, don't try to rationalize it, you do condone it.

Another thing to stress, which of late cannot be stressed enought 
either is the role of the Snakegod guild.  We are a family of 
friendly, non-cheating, non-pking, non-duping co-op players.  I have 
not found a clan with more intelligent, fun-loving and just fun 
people with which to play.  I joined because Snakegod was aligned 
with how I feel the game should be played.  And I was pleasantly 
surprised at the quality of people that are involved.  People that 
have come before me and the people that have followed in membership 
(such as Lepthana).

I am proud of what Snakegod has created and that for which they 
stand.  If you have questions about our guild, don't listen to the 
babble posted here.  Come to our channel, &#34;Snakegod&#34;, and 
talk to us.  We are very open to people coming in for some good fun 
and conversation.  However, we don't tolerate impoliteness and other 
such juvenile antics that certain people seem to enjoy.

Guess I had more to get off my chest than I thought.
