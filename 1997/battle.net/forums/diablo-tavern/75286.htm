<pre>below is a copy of a post that i put in the Hell Knights message 
board and i would like all my fellow inferno to read.  on there 
message board a quoted message is indicated by : not by &#62; 

: : PrImE I'm sorry but I can nolonger be a member of the Hell : : 
Knights. Please delete me from your
: : member list.

: : I founded my own clan, last month, I have been recruiting off the 
: : UO Chat but mainly off Diablo.
: : and have so far 21 members.

: : Visit the clan page, you will be pleasently surprised!
: : 
: : <a href="Http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~Smclap/UO/">Http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~Smclap/UO/</a>
: : Note | the Capitol S 
: :                                  Hysteria UO Clan

: : Inferno is the main Problem, the once proud Hell Knights have : : 
assimilated into a clan that lies about its
: : total size.
: : Inferno is a totally disorganize clan, They don't put there : : 
members on the site because then it would
: : show 
: : there real size. I suspect they have like 50-60 members just like 
: : the Hell Knights.

: : Think of this, when you are in UO. when it comes out, how the 
hell : : are you going to find fellow
: : Pkillers to combine as an Army to attack Other Guilds, Small : : 
Towns. etc.
: : You won't be able to do it. Inferno has no way of communicating : 
: with its members. You'll be lucky if
: : you can find a small buch of you let alone a whole army. 

: : That is why I founded Hysteria

: : I have founded Hysteria based on Communication, that is the key : 
: that will win wars in Ulitma Online.
: : Visit my Clan page and read about the Chain Of Command , this is 
a : : Communication system that will
: : keep all Hysteria members in touch with each other.
: : NO OTHER, I repeat NO OTHER clan will have a Comm system like : : 
: : this. (Unless they copy
: : Hysteria as a model).

: : Hysteria Members will be given a rank, based on there activeness 
: : in Hysteria. 
: : There are 21 Ranks & 12 medals. If a member recruits a new member 
: : you will be raise in rank if you
: : recruit 10 new members, you will be awarded a medal. 
: : I have setup five Division much like Inferno, 
: : but Divisions that people will use, not stupid Map Making : : 
Divisions or Exploring Divisions. 
: : Proper Division 
: : Military, Navy, Intelligence,Special Forces,Security.
: : 
: : I don't know if you guys know it or not, but you will be a fool 
if : : you go Pkilling by yourself, Most
: : people will be Adventuring in parties of 5-6. You will need to be 
: : with quite a few members,
: : and once they find out you are around then your dead meet, Unless 
: : you can call on your whole clan,
: : Hysteria Members will join up with there Division and just kick : 
: ass.
: : 

: : Inferno will not work. goto there web page, they care so little : 
: about there members they can't even
: : type out there names. 
: : That is how I feel about Inferno, Everyone was saying it was a : 
: Lovely Web Site page, All I see when
: : I goto it, is a few basic pages, with little updates. Thrown : : 
together so they can say they have a UO Web
: : page.
: : It will be just like Diablo's site, DEAD! 

: : If you are unhappy with Inferno. Come Join Hysteria, we have 21 : 
: member at present, and growing
: : rapidly.

: : Have a say in the way your clan goes, don't just follow the : : 
unorganized self proclaimed leaders.

: : PrImE I'm sorry I have to do this. But Inferno sucks.

: : 
: : Black_Sambuka / SpiritWalker

: 
: I too am going to be joining Hysteria. the HELL KNIGHTS have to 
:communication at all. I only have
:like 10 members from the Hell knights on my ICQ list (but I have to 
:admit that I got to know some of
:them very well, and I hope that we can still chat after this). I 
:don't really have any problem with
:INFERNO but I don't like the way they run things. They can't even 
:post there members. How the hell
:are people gonna know if you are INFERNO if people have no evidence. 
:I for one liked the HELL
:KNIGHTS when we were a seperate guild. Well PrImE, you can delete me 
:off of the members list, and
:thanks for everything. As for the rest of the HELL 
:KNIGHTS....Fairwell my friends. I strongly suggest
:that you all take a look at the HYSTERIA page. It is very well put 
:together.
:Tigerclaw



I too after lots of mental deliberation have decided to join Hysteria 
and leave Inferno/Hell Knights due to all the crap that takes place, 
in that clan. I will still make my prescence known among Inferno and 
HKs but not as a member. Prime, Please delete me from ur list and 
Black_Sambuka/SpiritWalker please add me to urs.  Preferably to one 
of those Division leader postitions. I will discuss that with you in 
further length leader. Thanks,
