<pre>      HI,
 Well I just got dumped from the game. BUT I just had the best time.
I hit a server line that refused to let me pass heading west through 
the desert looking for the Compassion Shrine. So I went south, around 
the mountains  and through the swamp and I came to the sea. Then I 
saw it. In all it's slendor, right at the shore..the Loch Ness 
Monster..ok
it was just a sea serpent, but it was 7 or 8 time as big as my 
character. Well, I took one look at it and said &#34;now that can 
make me alot of money if its dead!!&#34;..you see the scales are a 
reagent for some spells. Well me and my trusty dagger went to 
work...I lost half my life before it even took a little 
damage...darn..well I walked off very disapointed. Then I took a peek 
at nice map I have of the game and decided to head west then south. 
SO I turned around...and low and behold the sea serpent was back at 
shore..well I had no chance alone to kill him, then my luck turned 
for the best. Three individuals all wandered by. I enlisted thier 
help in slaying the vile beast. Well, one fellow had a sword, the 
other a pick and the other a bow. We got him all the way down to 
about 5&#37; life...and he ran away...we would have killed him but 
the archer ran out of arrows. Well, I will tell you that is one of 
the best times I have ever had playing a game.
Too bad he was a little girl and ran away..well back to beta...bye
