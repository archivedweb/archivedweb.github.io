&#62; Greetings,
&#62;     There have been many recent posts debating &#34;cheating vs 
&#62; legits&#34; etc, but I think most of them are too long and boring to 
&#62; read, so I'll be very blunt, nonphilosophical and down to the point 
&#62; with this post.
&#62; 

Some would say yours is to long, cheaters would probably say 
&#34;don't do it&#34; is too long and boring. Hey don't bash people 
who are trying to help especially when you do the same yourself.


&#62; 1. Diablo is a game.  Play it and have fun.  Play it however you have 
&#62; fun. If you are not having fun play it another way.
&#62; 

True, but there are others who can affect this.

&#62;  I have fun playing without cheating.  I find fun in getting new 
&#62; items, gaining levels, working with others to achieve a common goal, 
&#62; and other reasons.
&#62; 

Me too.

&#62; 2.  You can't STOP people from cheating as long as people want to.  
&#62; All you can do is educate people, give them the facts, then let them 
&#62; make a choice.  It is the same thing with smoking.  Give them the 
&#62; facts and give them the CHOICE.
&#62; 

I've converted one person so I won't stop.

&#62; 3.  If you don't like cheating join a noncheating guild/clan.
&#62; 

Started one: <a href="http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html">http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html</a>

&#62; 4.  Insulting and attacking cheaters doesn't make you any better than 
&#62; them.  It may give you a false sense of righteousness, but your 
&#62; spirit will be just as empty/full or emptier than it was before your 
&#62; attack.
&#62; 

Nah its fun and you said it yourself in 1 that we should play anyway 
we can to have fun.

&#62; 5.  Cheaters are people just like noncheaters/legits
&#62; 

Well, they sure aren't monkeys cause how else could they handle a 
mouse?

&#62; 6.  Diablo is meant for a MATURE gamer, many cheaters/legits are not 
&#62; mature enough to place this game in PERSPECTIVE
&#62; 

Diablo is meant to be bought for profit, lets face it those deamons 
aren't that scary. The word in your last statement &#34;mature&#34; 
is way to hard to explain take myself for instance sometimes I'm very 
serious and sometimes I'll say something like &#34;Will you marry 
me?&#34; in channels. This goes back to your #1 thing.


&#62; 7.  Visit my Diablo site at
&#62; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/5701">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/5701</a>
NO vist mine <a href="http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html">http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html</a>

&#62; 
&#62; any typos/bad grammar were intentional becuz i am very tired.

&#62; DrJudy lv 33 rogue

Any typos/bad grammer were because I'm not perfect.
