<pre>Earlier today I posted a little rant in response to acidic announcing 
his new website.  You see, he and I discussed how he liked my page 
and he wanted to use some of the same ideas for his own.  I agreed to 
let him use whatever ideas he wanted (after all, I got most of my 
ideas from my experiences surfing the web).

I reacted a bit harsh in my earlier post and am sorry. After talking 
at length with acidic I realize that he had spent only a few hours on 
his page and was excited about letting the readers here at Ogden's 
know about it (I can't blame him either, I have been there just 
recently hehe).  He did plagerize me, and for that he apologized.  
Again, he was just excited about putting a framework together and 
publishing it on the net.

Acidic would have fixed the blunder a lot sooner, however, geocities 
has been having problems with its web utility server today.  I should 
have realized this and refrained from making my hasty post.

Acidic is currently hard at work on his new site and I am looking 
forward to checking it out.
