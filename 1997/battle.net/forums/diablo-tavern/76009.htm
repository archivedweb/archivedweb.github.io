<pre>On Tue Jun 03 20:00, The Man (UO-INFERNO) wrote:
&#62; Well, gentlemen (you too, Sarco and Anubisan) and ladies (now THAT 
&#62; includes you, Sarco and Anubisan :), I am kicked out of INFERNO, and 
&#62; now that I am going, I think it is time for me to say my goodbyes, 
&#62; for I am not to be UO INFERNO and Diablo is basically dead.  So, now 
&#62; I am out forever.  But, it is my last post...so, I am going out with 
&#62; a bang.
Heh, maybe you wish I was a woman...
&#62; Gentlemen, my story.  I began as Blade, a level 1 nothing who build 
&#62; himself to level 39.  He was strong, brave, and my pride and joy.
&#62; 
&#62; I bought Diablo by accident, and it ended up being a good thing.  I 
&#62; was a good game.  I made pretty good salary, so, it was worth the $50 
&#62; dollars.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, I began my lonely beginnings as The Man, a character I created 
&#62; as a joke.  I began to worth to build him up (this is when cheats 
&#62; just came on the scene).  Then, the fateful game....
You created TheMan with cheats.
&#62; I joined a game called &#34;Help me!&#34; and three players were 
&#62; there, two warriors, one rogue.  We went down, and this guy, JOE, 
&#62; went after me. I barely got away.  He laughed at me, then left.
&#62; 
&#62; I then followed him, and got his number. (I was one of the few who 
&#62; knew about this command :)  And, I got it.  It was 45394.  And, I 
&#62; followed him.
&#62; 
&#62; I made it to level 38, no dots.  I cared nothing about them, I just 
&#62; wanted this guy dead.  And, there he was.  This loser...JOE, level 
&#62; 43, no longer level 12.  
&#62; 
&#62; I hunted him, and killed him.  And, he died :)  I then became a PK in 
&#62; my spare time.
I think not... why did you always hate us so much if you yourself 
were a PK?
&#62; Along this time, I met Devin, one of the best damn PKs I knew on 
&#62; B.net.  She was small time, but she taught me everything I needed to 
&#62; know.  She is probably the ONLY girl I know who plays Diablo (Besides 
&#62; flux :) and she was pretty good looking (picture :) but, a blonde, 
&#62; not my taste. :)  Well, she then one day left, personal problems, and 
&#62; I was left alone on B.net.
&#62;
&#62; Then, it started.  The BIG stuff.  One day, I found the forum.  By 
&#62; accident.  And what should I see, but INFERNO everywhere.  It was so 
&#62; nice.  These guys, the INFERNO, player killers.  This was around the 
&#62; time of cobi, and Ash, and Wynd the Rogue.  Wynd became a symbol of 
&#62; hate for me. I hated PKs, but I WAS a PK..bad logic. :)  So, I flamed 
&#62; him one day...I was level 43 by then, no dots. ( Tribute to Joe)
&#62; 
&#62; Bye this time, I had already lost my number of about 4000 something 
&#62; to now number 7---- something (I NEVER quite remember :(.  So, I 
&#62; flamed Wynd.  Then, I met Mikedog.
&#62; 
&#62; Mikedog is probably the best damn Warrior PK there is, and I miss him 
&#62; so.  He flamed me..so we had a little war. :)
&#62; 
&#62; And, I ended up one night meeting him, in game Mikedog.  Needless to 
&#62; say, he kicked my ass :) (I did not know about Fireresistance UNTIL 
&#62; then :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, I vowed revenge.  And, I got fire resistance.  And, I beat 
&#62; him..with a damn staff equipped. (Was Thundercall :)  And how, after 
&#62; I beat him twice, he tried to TK me :).  But, it was okay..cheats 
&#62; were new, right?
Like Hell I believe that. 
&#62; Then, I went into the INFERNO channel.  There, I met PegLeg, Ash, and 
&#62; Anubisan.......the resident racist of B.net (Next to Sarco.)  I 
&#62; generally flamed them, and they squelched me (NOW you know how I 
&#62; perfected those techniques to anger people. :)
*Ahehem* My views may sound racist at first, maybe they are, but if 
you understood the whole picture you wouldn't think of them so.
&#62; It was fun..until one day, INFERNO became plagued by cheats.  A good 
&#62; number of them were cheating.  And, then, Mikedog quit, and became my 
&#62; friend.  We made &#34;peace.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Then, as fate would have it...Sarcomastogora and I met....Eugene 
&#62; himself.  He seemed arrogant, nasty, hateful..just what I needed to 
&#62; help me get INFERNO.
&#62; 
&#62; So, we began little &#34;raids.&#34;  Our chemistry was great.  I 
&#62; have to admit, if you ever want ANYONE to piss people off, get Sarco. 
&#62; :)  Well, we hounded INFERNO, and Sarco was awesome.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, PegLeg got mad at me, and then, we ended up wanting to duel.  
&#62; Sarco then suggested a plan to me.  This was it...&#34;we gunna clone 
&#62; them.  Say you did.  i handle the rest.&#34;  I said okay.
&#62;
&#62; I fought PegLeg, noticed small flame on his sword (WOAH I said :) and 
&#62; got beat.  Peg then said, and I quote, after he killed me 
&#62; &#34;kill.&#34;  THAT is lamer then RESISTANCE IS FUTILE, etc.  You 
&#62; can't beat that. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, I came back..Sarco whispered.  And, then, we said I cloned Peg.
More like you DID clone Peg, along with flux. I killed your flux 
clone, I still have the ear. I remember specifically that the first 
time I dueled flux I told her I wouldn't keep the ear. I didn't. 
Then, I dueled your clone of her (which I killed easily, due to your 
lack of skill), and took the ear. 
&#62; It angered him, and he got mad, and then some guy named Raolin said 
&#62; he KNEW Peg cheated, etc.  And, it got bigger and bigger.  Then, I 
&#62; met flux-babe.
Wow, Raolin... I had almost forgotten him.
&#62; I pretended to buy an ear off her ( A mikedog ear :)  And, she told 
&#62; me about the Virginkiller. :)
&#62; 
&#62; So, I told Sarco I would pretend to clone her..and he appluaded my 
&#62; efforts.  So, then Sarco and I go to a game..and he gives me a crown 
&#62; with a skull on it..called the Lightforge.  &#34;COOL!&#34; I said.  
&#62; &#34;What is it for?&#34;  
&#62; &#34;Nothing&#34; Sarco said..and told me to brag about how I got it 
&#62; from Peg.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, it slowly got worse when I said I got it from Peg..and I guess 
&#62; he DID have one.  Then, I was spammed by Peg and flux for hours. :)
Just like the underhanded individual you are.
&#62; Well, then, I met Anubisan, and I pretended to clone him..he handled 
&#62; me really cool, not doing anything. I INSTANTLY respected him.  He 
&#62; seemed too cool for me. :)
No... I remember it different. You never respected me, and I never 
respected you. I was NEVER your friend, not matter how much you may 
have wanted me to be.
&#62; Well, then, Sarco and I did our best to ruin INFERNO.  Then, I 
&#62; learned about &#34;Bahamut, King of the Espers&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; He was a nice guy, and I defended him, so we went out to cleanse 
&#62; INFERNO.  It was nice :)  But, soon, that plan turned to disaster, 
&#62; and he left.  So, I was alone.
Funny, you've had a long history of hating INFERNO.
&#62; For a break in the action, between this time I met Dennis, a Warrior. 
&#62; He and I NEVER PK'd together, we were always CO-OP.  He is now 
&#62; Darkmage.  He and I found LOTS of stuff co-oping, and he is probably 
&#62; one of the best you will ever meet. *shameless plug* :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, then, Hell Knights started entering the channel.  My first REAL 
&#62; friend was Tyrael.  And, then I also met Prime, Fusion, and others.  
&#62; They were real nice guys.  HK are the best :)
Ass kisser. 
&#62; Well, after that, Peg and I kept hating each other, and no one forgot 
&#62; my cloning joke.  But, as things went on, I began to be more bold and 
&#62; befriend people.  Like Tyrael, acidic Overdose, SnowRabbit.  Plus, 
&#62; Lord Pantera, our now own resident &#34;Evil Ernie.&#34; :)
No, I NEVER forgot what you did.
&#62; Abou this time, Eugene was in his prime, Tarot was starting to be 
&#62; big, and the jokes of &#34;Disco INFERNO&#34; were dying down. Wynd 
&#62; had left, story telling was in, and the first patch was out.  All was 
&#62; well.
&#62; 
&#62; I then began to hate cheaters with a passion. Anubisan, now who hates 
&#62; my guys, taught me to hate them with a passion. (Remember your old 
&#62; number, Set?  #16552?)  Well, then Set came along...he flamed me all 
&#62; the time.  Not nice :) He and I began to seriously hate each other, 
&#62; and our battle continued.
16652, NOT 16552.
&#62; Well, then, I began to like INFERNO.  Flux babe was starting to not 
&#62; hate me (we used to have FIGHTS in those days..without the OP, you 
&#62; either yelled or squelched :)  All was well.
Ya, we didn't pay much attention to little piss-offs like you back 
then.
&#62; Then, PegLeg, came up to me one day.  He said &#34;I may not like you 
&#62; much, but you want in?&#34;
Hahahahaha, bullshit, 'nuff said.
&#62; I said &#34;Is this a joke?&#34;  He said &#34;No.  Are you in?&#34; 
&#62; I said okay.  Then, I was INFERNO UO. :)
You're getting your time a little screwed up... UO's existance was 
barely known back then, UO-INFERNO didn't even exist.
&#62; Well, now, began my great chapter in history.  My, as I call it, 
&#62; &#34;The Man days.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; I began by making friends with SnowRabbit, Evil, Anubis, MysticForce, 
&#62; and the like.  Cronus was around by now, and he is probably the 
&#62; ultimate persona (Fluffy Bunny, eat your heart out :).  Cronus was 
&#62; the &#34;cool beans&#34; and he was so good at what he did...making 
&#62; useless posts that were so damned good! :)  He is an icon.  (He was 
&#62; Sir Lucifer, but oh well :(
Ass kissing, more like it. You PAYED everyone to be your friend.
&#62; Well, next began my &#34;fans.&#34;  My first fan was &#34;the 
&#62; KoR.&#34;  These were the Knights of Retribution (Kings of 
&#62; Retardation, as BLZ BOBO said. :) (Remember beezlebub (spelling), 
&#62; BLZ? :)  Well, we used to spam their channels and make them leave ALL 
&#62; time.  I joked that that is why Blizzard made OP's :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, we eventually made them leave, and all was well.  Raistlin, one 
&#62; of the older members of INFERNO, was gone by now, and Lightstryder 
&#62; was upon us.  It was great. I loved it.
Raistlin wasn't around that long, never was. He was a good player and 
a good friend, though.
&#62; And, next came BLG.  Thus began INFERNO channel spams.  They would 
&#62; say &#34;look for combo swords!&#34; and we had to take it.  We got 
&#62; about 78 people in their channel once, though :).  Bye now, Janna/Set 
&#62; hated me. Oh well. :)
&#62; 
&#62; I began to hate cheaters with KoR, and with Black Lotus Guild (Big 
&#62; Loser Guys, again by BLZ :) it became an obsession, and I hounded 
&#62; them, until they also faded in the shadows.
&#62; 
&#62; By now, the mighty guild of Tarot was almost gone, Zodiac was over, 
&#62; and all was with the cheats.  And, we still were doing well.  But, 
&#62; then the God Mode from players on..and ruined PKing.
&#62; 
&#62; Next, ALL these losers came in, challenging us, trying to beat us.  
&#62; We held them back, and then more cheats came out, and then a patch.  
&#62; By now, Peg was almost disappearing. And UO became priority.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, next thing we know, in fighting began in INFERNO.  Mainly Janna 
&#62; and me.  And, then OP's.  When you could have more than one OP, we 
&#62; always had to be careful.  I came in one day, and who should be there 
&#62; but Fusion, with a gavel. I was like &#34;Jesus!&#34; and he told me.
&#62; 
&#62; Then, I still liked Sarco by now, but then, he made a fatal move.  He 
&#62; made EVERYONE OP's when I made him OP, so now everything was screwed 
&#62; up.  Bad for me, and I never forgave myself.  So, we began to hate 
&#62; each other.
&#62; 
&#62; I banned Sarco from then on, and the rest is him being a racist, etc.
&#62; 
&#62; I then began my &#34;fans.&#34;  My first fan was FuknFun!!!, a 
&#62; traitor. Tyrael and I caught him, and we made him &#34;pay.&#34;  
&#62; THIS is where I got my reputation as a jerk.  I never left him alone 
&#62; until he gave up.  He WAS a traitor, and a cheater.  But, we all know 
&#62; that. :)
The history could use a bit of chronological reorganization, but I'm 
feeling too lazy right now. 
&#62; Next came Random, a high talking loser who loved to call me 
&#62; &#34;Chuck.&#34;  I don't why :)  He also thought I was in high 
&#62; school.  No, man.  But, he gave up, and we ALL knew he cheated.  We 
&#62; called him Hogger, and it stuck.  Like a stuck pig :)
Ya, nobody like Fishgirl.
&#62; Well, bye now, Sexy-Rogue was a memory, and thus began my fan 
&#62; &#34;the Godly Soul&#34; which I dubbed &#34;The Paper Tiger.&#34;  
&#62; Nice time with him, after he was banned for the rape posts.
Why did Talon/Sexy-Rogue even bother coming back?
&#62; I had various others, but they are trivial.  But, that is generally 
&#62; how my life went.  Many friends, many enemies...
&#62; 
&#62; Then, Anubisan and I began our &#34;Feud.&#34;  I don't why, I 
&#62; thought he was just a jerk, but we needed to verbally spar.  And we 
&#62; did it so well :)
I never forgot the way you acted when I first met you. First 
impressions COUNT A LOT.
&#62; Well, then, last Friday..it blew up in my face.  I saw those rape 
&#62; posts, and I lost my mind and made a petition. It worked. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Next, I verbally spared with Anubisan on Monday..Tracy and fist lost 
&#62; it, and we were banned from INFERNO. More like kicked.  And I did 
&#62; nothing wrong, I wanted peace..but, that is how life goes.
They didn't lose, nor did anyone else. They were sick of the fighting 
and your shit.
&#62; So, I am now out of INFERNO Diablo and UO INFERNO.  But, Bahamut and 
&#62; my friend Mikedog are back, and Anubisan HATES to see them in, so I 
&#62; am happy :)
Mikey? I have no problem with Mikey, but I have a BIG problem with 
Bahamut. Bahamut has been such a sh*t to INFERNO, I can't believe 
he's being let back in.
&#62; Now, for all of those of you demanding my equipment over the months, 
&#62; here it is....
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Royal Circlet&#34;  Found with Dennis, nice find.
&#62; &#34;Awesome Plate of the Tiger&#34;  Very good, found alone, dropped 
&#62; by Gorash.
&#62; &#34;Awesome Shielf of the Tiger&#34;  Nice item, Gothic Version :(
&#62; &#34;Diamond Ring of the Zodiac&#34;  Hey, plus 20 all, and that 
&#62; resist Magic thing :)
&#62; &#34;Ring of the Zodiac&#34; Found one night with Dennis, plus 20 
&#62; all, nice. :)
&#62; &#34;Garnet Amulet of the Zodiac&#34;  Plus 20 all, resist fire about 
&#62; 45&#37;.  Nice find :)
&#62; &#34;And, my sword..the Grandfather&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; My Sword, the Grandfather, was my ONLY weapon this whole time.  That 
&#62; was all I used as a weapon, the Grandfather, my first unique.  I will 
&#62; epxlain how I found it.
&#62; 
&#62; I was playing one night as The Man, and had not found a unique yet.  
&#62; Was very strange :(.  Well, I eventually made my way to Lazarus..and 
&#62; I found what I can only think of as amazing...Arch Bishop Lazarus and 
&#62; Red Vex and Black Jade.  I ran around, fought, ran some more (I was a 
&#62; level 23 warrior :) and eventually had Lazarus trapped.  I beat him, 
&#62; and an item with gold text hit the ground.  A great sword.  
&#62; &#34;Damn,&#34; I said, &#34;two handed.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; But, this was MORE than a Great Sword...it was only one handed.  I 
&#62; went to town to ID it, and here was the Grandfather.
&#62; 
&#62; My Grandfather
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;10-20 damage, plus 5 all, plus 20 HP, +70&#37; damage, plus 
&#62; 20&#37; hit, 179/179 durability (several shrines over time :), One 
&#62; handed.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Well, that was an awesome weapon...and still is.  My first unique 
&#62; served me well.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, some more about me.  No one realized who I was, so time to go 
&#62; into my &#34;personal life&#34;

&#62; To Haplo:  Thanks, spy. :(
&#62; To Dennis:  My co-op friend..we can still play :)
&#62; To Anubisan:  &#34;Watch your back.&#34;  I may be out now, my little 
&#62; racist friend..but every breath you take, every move you make, every 
&#62; bond your break, every step you take...I'll be going &#34;Sure, 
&#62; Set.&#34; :) You taught me that cheating is to hate..yet hack your 
&#62; ACC.  Hmm, now who is the B.Sing Hypocrite? :)
My little racist friend? Hahaha, I am far from little... and I should 
watch my back? Why should I be afraid of YOU? I hacked my account 
number 'cuz Eugene told me about it, I thought it would be cool. I 
never thought about how I might not be able to change it back. As far 
as you using me to cover you being a hypocrit; YOU have ALWAYS been a 
hypocrit with all of your hacked/cloned characters (oh, but you 
didn't tell anyone about them, did you? Such as Amon_Ra and all the 
others).
&#62; Well, everyone on B.net, I am off to do some stuff, like go to bed.
&#62; 
&#62; For UO, and Battle.net, good night.  I will see you guys someday, and 
&#62; maybe we can kill again.  But, rules are rules, I guess, but the deck 
&#62; seemed stacked.
&#62;
&#62; To the haters of INFERNO, remember &#34;RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; And to INFERNO themselves...be destined for greatness.
&#62; 
&#62; Just watch if I get the stones, I need to keep them now :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, guys, take care, and have fun on B.net for me.  I am now gone, 
&#62; maybe things can heal themselves.
&#62; 
&#62; To everyone, good night.  And thanks, Blizzard.  But the Man has to 
&#62; move on.
&#62; 
&#62; Bye, Everyone.  INFERNO, take care.
&#62; 
&#62; One little request...if you ever hear the radio and hear the song 
&#62; &#34;King of Pain&#34; by The Police, think of me.
&#62; 
&#62; And, that is that. :)
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO) {Charles W. Malette}
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;And then came the night after.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Poscript:  Bye, friends.... :)
&#62; 
&#62; P.P.S.  Devin? I will be with you soon. :)
Still trying to ass kiss INFERNO to the end, eh? As far as 
remembering you goes, I hope I don't. You aren't worth the bother.

It's funny, ya know. All these problems started occuring WHEN YOU 
JOINED; everything was fine when I was in INFERNO and you weren't.
And it's always everyone else's fault, isn't it? That is your biggest 
problem: your ego is FAR too big, and you refuse to admit you've even 
done something wrong.
