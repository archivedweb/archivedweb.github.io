<pre>Guess what folks.  I have actual proof The Man is a cheater, words 
from his own mouth.  I thank CARDINAL CURUNIR for his unknowning but 
important awaking of this evidence.  Now, this is how I came up with 
it.  On our PoC board, we started playing a little game.  It was 
called, end out posts with the lame comments that The Man has played. 
 Several PoC played, including Cardinal Curunir.  Well, he provided 
me the evidence from his quotes that caused me to check on it and 
secure evidence from the horses mouth that, well..HE IS A CHEATING 
BSER.  Now, here is the evidence.

On Mon July 14 at 15:04(pacific time I do believe) The Man posted in 
this very tavern:

&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
I am not going to apologize to quitters.

              PoC, I am growing tired.

              Tracy, we can duel, arrange a time sometime Friday, I 
am busy the 
              rest of the week.  That is, if you don't chicken out. 
:)  I mean, you 
              are PoC...how good can you be?

              And, to PoC....

              NO offense, but I am angry at quitters who quit and 
then expect the 
              guild they left to be friendly.

              And, I am requesting to INFERNO to have you guys banned 
from the 
              channel.  Because of one person.

              Pyro forced Fusion to quit.  And Pyro?  I may duel 
you..when you get 
              good, and when you can talk without sounding like white 
trash in 
              every word you say.  

              So, I say this for PoC...

              You guys can act all tough and big, but I still see 
right through 
              you. You are all 13-17 year old kids trying to be big.

              So, PoC, you guys can stay out of INFERNO's way, 
period.  

              But, TO make decisions in INFERNO, so they are the ones 
to decide.

              And to the PoC who call me a pussy, I may have cared, 
but you guys 
              are just chopped liver also rans.  Shlonglor's 
Barbarians could beat 
              you guys.

              And Tracy?  Duel me on Friday. No ref.  If there is a 
ref, then just 
              forget about it.  That way, we can settle it between us.

              And to Elijah and the other ilk, you guys can TRY and 
get me in UO.  
              I just hope for your sakes I don't have some 
&#34;advantage,&#34; 
              like stones. :)

              Because this is not a threat to PoC.  Nor a Warning.

              This is a promise.

              You stay away from INFERNO, and get lost.  And if you 
do not....

              Then I may need to stop being as kind to you as I have 
been.

              And SnowRabbit?  When you officially stop being a 
coward and come 
              back, we can talk.

              And now, I am off to gain the last two million 
experience and become 
              level 50.

              See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.

              The Man (UO-INFERNO)

              P.S.  Flux?  Say one word about this....I dare 
you.&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&
#60;&#60;

The thing to remember what the man says here is &#34;And now, I am 
off to gain the last two million experience to become level 50&#34;.

NOW, this is what he posted on the PoC board, on Monday July 14 at 
19:17 est.  Now, because of the difference between time zones, that 
is exactly ONE hour pretty much later.  Here is the post.

&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
Well, Quitters of Chaos, a few things. 

         Flux, we need to TALK. You are FAR from leader of INFERNO, 
and do not
         even begin to THINK you are. 

         Now then, for you, PoC. 

         If you gentlemen, and I use that term loosely, know what is 
good for you, forget
         about INFERNO and stay away from us. End of story. No 
alliances, no
         friendships, you are traitors...stay out. 

         Pyro? Interesting conversation with Flux today...very 
interesting stuff going on
         between you two. 

         Eugene? Get over yourself. 

         And Tracy....we duel on Friday. No ref. If you want one, and 
insist, then we
         don't fight. Those are the terms, if you want any others, 
email me. I doubt I will
         post on this forum again. Nice work on the page, I must say, 
Morte. Excellent
         forum. 

         And to those who doubt me, I do not care. 

         Now then, I am off to gain the last 750,000 exp until level 
50. 

         Bye. 

         The Man (UO-INFERNO) 

         'What can I say? I'm a jerk..but NOT a quitter unlike a few 
special people.' 

         P.S. I am not Sexy-Rogue...I can guarentee that. Unlike her, 
I can be rational at
         times. 
:)&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#6
0;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;

Now, HERE the man says he is off to get the last 750,000 exp.  Ok, 
that means that in exactly ONE hour of time, The Man got 1.25 MILLION 
EXP.  Everyone remembers what The Man said below correct?  He said 
you get 10 exp from a monster, and that ONE HELL RUN gives you 10K of 
EXP.  HMMM, lets do the math shall we?  Ok, 1.25 million exp at 10 
exp per monster = 125,000 monsters killed in ONE HOUR.  Lets 
continue.  The Man said in one hell run levels 13-16 you get about 
10K of exp.  Now that means that in order to get the needed 1.25 
million exp, the man made 125 Hell runs in ONE HOUR.  HAR, lets 
continue!!  With 125,000 thousand monsters killed in one hour, that 
means the man killed roughly 2073 monsters a minute, and 34 monsters 
a SECOND. HAR.  Now, we know for sure the man is lying cheating piece 
of crap.  However, we can even take this further yet.  Lets say for 
arguement sake that The Man was mistaken on his post on our board, 
and he still needed to get his 2 million EXP.  Ok, for 2 million exp 
the man would have to kill 200,000 monsters.  Lets say the man is a 
god, and he can kill a monster a second, so that makes 60 monsters a 
minute.  Now, divide 200,000 by 60 monsters and you get 3,333 
minutes.  Divide 3,333 by 60 for hours, and you get 55 hours of non 
stop play.  That would of taken the man 2.2 days of playing, and 
would equal 200 Hell runs from level 13-16.  Seeing how the man plays 
8 hours a day, it should have taken him about 1 week.  1 week of 
killing a monser a second, 8 hours straight a day.  HAR HAR HAR.  
Now, we all KNOW it is impossible to kill a monster a second, let 
alone complete 200 hell runs in 2 or 3 days.  Anyway, The Mans post 
where he describes how much exp he needs are still on the PoC board 
and here on Ogden's.  I don't wanna go post the url to them cause I 
already pasted the entire things in this message.  I just wanted you 
all to see for yourself what a fool the man IS and always has been.  
The Man, you are a cheater, with evidence taken from your own BSED 
posts.  One thing about BSing liars, is at some point they get 
overwhelmed with their own lies, and caught, just like the man is 
right now.  Later.
