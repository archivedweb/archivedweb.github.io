<pre>This morning was quite interesting... I got PKed by Flux(I'll get you 
for that) and was a witness to some pretty sick things in the 
Snakegod channel. Seems the Godly Soul popped by to talk about rape 
and retract his apology posted here
This kid is 15 years old...!!!!!! What can he possibly know about 
anything...??? TheMan was trying to get him to explain his 
position. But the kid just does not get it... He needs to have his 
diablo software taken away from him and banned for life. I wonder 
what his parents would think??? If he wasn't in Korea I'd go to his 
house take his CD and erase his hard drive. Kids...!!!!!!!!!
I swear!!! Then Anubisan comes in and starts spreading racist fascist 
crap about being a Nazi. Ban him too!!!!! We don't need that kind of 
crap!!
I have no love for TheMan or Inferno, but he is right. And Sir 
Dumbass or whoever you are I'll take you down anyday...even with your 
cheats.

Poor snakegods... there channel op is a lag ghost and they had to sit 
through all this crap...Sorry guys...
