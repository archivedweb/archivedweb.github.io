<pre>Okay... I'm as bored as that dude, so check it... all the offspring 
lyrics for all their songs...
A Thousand Days

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you
I'll tell you no lies
When all is said and done
Does it really matter who's wrong or right
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
As I lie bleeding here I still
I still reach for you

A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Your eyes are open now but you know
It's still hard to see inside
When action and intention
Are two separate things
Now I somehow wish I could explain
Why we hurt each other again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you

A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Forever we've been
Trapped by our hearts
Trapped by our minds
I'd like to leave
I'd like to win at love

But I just can't let it go
And I just can't watch it slipping away
And I just can't let it go
And I just can't stand another minute

Maybe now someday our shattered live
Will mend themselves again
But now a million miles away
I still wish I could
And though I somehow know, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you
All I Want

Day after day your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just
Breathe down your neck
You get no respect
You get no relief
And yell out your peace

So back off your rules
Back off your jive
'Cos I'm sick of not living
To stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled
That's all I want
All I want

How many times is it gonna take
Till someone around you hears what you say
You've tried being cool
You feel like a lie
You've played by their rules
Now it's their turn to try
So back off your rules
Back off your jive
'Cos I'm sick of not living
To stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled
That's all I want
All I want

I said it before
I'll say it again
If you could just listen
Then it might make sense
Amazed

Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown
Cause everyone around's so hollow
I'm alone

Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown
But no one makes a sound
They follow
And I'm alone

Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow
One more day and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
And if I make it I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed
And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face
Your heart breaks
No one cares
And when you know you can't go on
Cause everything is wrong
Your heart breaks
But no one's there
Bad Habit

Hey man you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car
Don't give me no crap
Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving I stay in my lane
But getting cut off makes me insane
I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

'Cos I got a bad habit
Of blowing it away (yeah, yeah)
'Cos I got a bad habit
And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)

Well they say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off I'm the danger you'll face
You drive on my ass
You're foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last

'Cos I got a bad habit
Of blowing it away (yeah, yeah)
'Cos I got a bad habit
And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)

Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease
Something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddam motherfucker
I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride
Beheaded

Mommy doesn't have a head any more
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor
Well that's alright man, that's OK
She never really used her head anyway

Daddy called me a silly bore
Bet he won't say that any more
Because the way his body is severed too
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use

Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

Watch my girl friend come to the door
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor
Now watching my baby's jugular blow
Really makes my motor go

Wrap a towel round the bloody stump
Take my baby's body to the city dump
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack

Beheaded, watch her spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

All my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles
Use to be a little, but a little got more and more
Now I'm craving yours

Night brings bad dreams, bad dreams and guillotines

Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head

Find another victim for my machine
Put him in a home-made guillotine
Blade falls, gonna need a casket
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket

Leave the house at a quarter to four
Come back with sixteen or more
Cause the more I walk, the more I see
I got a funny feeling coming over me

Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

Blackball

In this world of hate and shallowness
Where enemies become your consolation
And those of us who win the game give up our minds
I don't call that winning
Say this doesn't apply to you
But ask yourself first
What have I done today to win the game
And just what have I sacrificed

Win the battle lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel

Reflect on all our yesterdays
My own words choke me
Why were they spoken
Regret for the things I've said and done
Just can't compare with
Regret for those that I have never tried
So blame this world or blame yourself
It's really all the same
When you are standing on the precipice
From which you just cannot return

Win the battle or lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel

In the style of forgotten men
I look to my horizon
I see nothing
While thoughts of guns and desecration
Sweep through my mind
But only coffins and bones remain
As I look to you
The emptiness behind your eyes
Seals my decision
Can't carry on in this world of jugglers
Where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings
Your key to success
What kind of tradition to carry on

Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball Your evil ways
Have found their way inside me

Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball For a better life
In this high tech dog eat dog existence

Burn It Up

I think I'm burning up inside
I think I'll take a little ride
I'm gonna light up everything in sight

I'll drive on by your yard
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car
Then another one in the local bar

Ignition
They call it an obsession
But I think it's kinda bitchen'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Tonight this 'hood will be a pyre
I'm gonna set your house on fire
I'll dance around the pretty flames
Such a wonderful game

I want to make a tiki torch
I'm gonna throw it on your porch
Then I'm gonna run away
And come back another day

Ignition
They call it an obsession
But I think it's kinda bitchen'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

So many houses, so little time
So many reasons, I'm not a crime.
I'd like to set you up
I'd like to set you up...


Change The World

I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one
And everyone's so blind
They're not to help mankind
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one

You don't want to change the world like you say
You're in it for yourself
No one else
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world

Now when the day is set they'll line up all the same
And those that need the most will never get or gain
The ones you call your friends
Are failing you again
Reach into your bag of tricks and make it go away

You don't want to change the world like you say
You're in it for yourself
No one else
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
You're ready
Saving yourself
You're gonna change the world

And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie
Go on now they won't tell
Go on now and save yourself

Come Out And Play

You gotta keep 'em separated
Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease

The gangs stake their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal
If one guys colors and the others don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...

Hey - man you talkin' back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey - man you disrespecting me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope

Hey - man you disrespecting me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey - man you talking back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey come out and play

Cool To Hate

I hate a lot of things
I hate a lot of people that are lame
I like to hate stuff
'Cos then I don't have to try and make a change

I hate teachers
I hate school
I hate the cheerleaders
And anyone who's cool
I hate the office
I hate the quad
Don't wanna learn nothing
I want to be a slob

It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
Don't like nothing and I like that fine
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
Don't like nothing and I like that fine
Don't like nothing and I like that fine
Yeah I hate everything
I even hate you too
So fuck you

I'm always thinking bad
I never have nothing good to say
I'd rather tear things down
Than build them up
It's easier that way

I hate the jocks and
I hate the geeks
I hate the trendies but
I also hate the freaks
I hate Doc Martens
And Muscle Tee's
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery

It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
Liking something's just a waste of time
Liking something's just a waste of time
Yeah I hate everything
I even hate me too
So fuck you

I'll cut you down and give you lip
Being positive's so unhip
I'll cut you down 'cos I'm a fool
Being positive's so uncool
Being positive's so uncool

I hate the jocks and
I hate the geeks
I hate the trendies but
I also hate the freaks
I hate your band and
I hate TV
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery

Crossroads

Time has washed away
And now I may wonder
How did it all slip by
Cause I always thought
We had forever
Future calls to me
To take me away from things
I don't want to leave behind
Like I'm slipping away
I can't hold on

Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

Through it all
My mind still wanders
To the one who touched my soul
Though her road leads away
She's still my
True love
I could believe

Will is not enough when all those
Lost days stand in the way
But she was
My hopes and dreams my
Whole world
I could believe

I still want to know
Who can see for me
Crossroads tell me

Now you'll have to trade
Your past away
And find another day
So is change a friend or an enemy

Through what comes to pass
I'll find my way
I've seen it all before
But is the best you can be
The best thing to be
Some people say
You're just wasting time
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

Demons

Clouds pass over the moon
Like an eye that shows impending doom
Tension in this misty air
Souls pass into the room
Drawn in by a lost memory
You will join them in the moonlight

You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in death

Time passes like the wind
As we race to beat days dusky grin
Mornings just a moment away
Your body glistens in candlelight
As we all look on in fiendish delight
The ritual is just beginning

Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
As virgins and spectres sing
This madness will never cease

In the dead of night
You will follow
In the footsteps of many others
Who have come before
I will show you the altar
Your Aztec eyes, Egyptian hair
Your beauty bestowed upon my lair
I've loved you before, in other lives
But you've never meant as much to me
Never meant as much to me as now

In this night of sacrifice
where blood is spilt
That will never spill again
But in your linen robes
We want you now
We want you now
You could never ask for more than that

You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in
Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
This madness will never cease

Dirty Magic

In my own simple way
I think she wants me only
She said, &#34;Come over right away&#34;

But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on her brand new face

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so but love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic

I should know better than
To think I'd reach inside her
It's all a cloudy kind of daze

She's not so sweet today
She mocks me, I'm no fighter
It all just seems like such a waste
It's oversimplified

Don't Pick It Up

I saw a little kid
As he walked around
He picked a candy bar up
Off the ground
He chowed about a half
Then his face turned blue
Turns out that candy bar was doggy-doo

Don't pick it up I say
Unless you can throw it away
Don't pick it up I say
You're gonna be bummed that you went that way

You're out there makin' bacon
No scrutiny
You mess around to much
And you got VD
You know you never think
And you're sore today
You're gonna take it back to californ-i-a

My friend was kinda hurtin'
For a girl to try
He saw one that looked like Pat
On Saturday Night Live
It had a pair of thingies
A moustache too
Not clearly male or female
So what to do

Elders

When we younger
There always seemed like
Some perfect mold
That we're supposed to be
But now we're growing up and
I see it's just not that way
Now I feel like someone's lied to me

Cause I've been true
Made good for you
And now I feel used
I'm asking you
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be like you

Tell me now elders
What were your reasons for
Making it seem
Like you were so much more
If you want to feel good
Because of our accomplishments
Why the fuck
Don't you just do it yourself

Cause I've tried
Man I've tried
While you all lied
So now just tell me
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be like you

Look at all the families now
Who don't talk and don't trust
Because of the way
That things have been done
When will you finally learn
To leave out the bullshit
And just be straight with us

Forever And A Day

Look at me while I look at you
Seeing eye to eye is something we can never do
You try to tell me what is right
I may not know a lot but I know one thing

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just keep it your own

I wonder why our world is ablaze
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say
I try to have an open mind
But your brain and mouth must not connect

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just leave me alone

I would be patient
But it takes so long
I don't want all this misinformation
All the words that you say

Lean on me while I lean on you
If we destroy each other
We might save a life or two
A little sun, a little shine
Separates us both by forever and a day

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got a vision
Then I don't want to see
If you've got a notion
Don't waste it on me

Genocide

Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it we are one
Dog eat dog
To get by
Hope you like my genocide
I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
The pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time
We can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow
Our time is up
I bet you'd only run
If you saw what goes inside our own
I bet you'd lead the way
If it were up to you to decide
But it's not

Get It Right

I've been told that to get what you want
You just gotta give what you can
But I know for what I want
It don't come as easy as that

They say &#34;Look out, boy. Tomorrow comes
And things will look better by then&#34;
But I'll look out the window
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again

Still can't get it right
For all I know
I swear I never will

Do you think you'd sell your soul
To just have one thing to turn out right?
For the thousandth time you turn and find
That it just makes no difference to try

Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself
There's got to be a better way
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
Dream of brighter days

No way out
Same old stuff always drags me down
No way out
Never gonna get it


Gone Away

Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal it's so unfair

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
But black roses and hail Mary's
Can't bring back what's taken from me
I reach to the sky
And call out your name
And if I could trade
I would

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it stings
Yeah it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away

Gotta Get Away

I'm getting edgy all the time
There's someone around me just a step behind
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
There's one guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake
Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me
I tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug
Life is a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
I think I'm being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground

Hypodermic

When you're feeling low
Hypodermic's where you go
When you're with yourself
You wish you could be someone else

Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste - run away
Your life's a waste - run away

Once you get a ride
Doesn't matter where you lied
Once you shoot it in
Doesn't matter who you've been

Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste - run away
Your life's a waste - run away

You're reaching in but you don't know where you begin
All your dance and song won't
Matter when you're gone

I Choose

Look at me I'm fallin'
Off a cliff now
I can still hear my mama yelling no no no
But the words mean nothing
Can't catch up to me now
And the view is so beautiful
All the way down

When I was a little boy
Suckin' juice from a bottle
Believing my perceptions were oh so real
But I didn't know nothing
Still knowing nothing
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel

This is life
What a fucked up thing we do
What nightmare come true
Or a playground if we choose
And I choose

Look at me I'm swollen
Like a banana fish, now
I'm never gonna make it out of my hole
But I keep on laughing
Doesn't really matter
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul

When I was a teenager
Suckin' booze with the vatos
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21
They said they wouldn't make it
They didn't make it
We're all naked when the day is said and done

Don't know who made this all come true
But now while you're here
You just gotta do what you gotta do

Now if I wasn't such a weenie
Do you think you'd still love me
Pretending I'm an airplane on the living room floor
But like a lovely generator
You stand right by me
And if words were wisdom I'd be talking even more

So I keep on falling
As I'm looking back above me
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot
Now I'm like Deniro
I'm Amarillo
And I'll never know when I hit the ground

I'll Be Waiting

Once I had a friend that I could count on
So I thought
Well so it seemed
But times of need are not enough
To prove your friendship to me now
Once I saw a face that I believed in
But a mask was all there was
So who wears the masks and who wears the faces
Well I guess I'll never know

But as I stand here alone in a room full of people
With nothing to say
Beer on their minds, and smoke in the air
Call them friends but they just don't care

Friend for life
Such shallow words for broken minds
Show me a friend for life
Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day

Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
Cause when we're together we just can't get enough
Or is it we just can't get what we want
Once I saw a dream, I had to chase it
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Who's at fault in this game of yours and mine
Well I guess I'll never know

But as I sit here alone
Think of the girl who came softly inside me
The look in her eyes, the smell of her hair
Call her my own but is she really there?

Love for life
Such noble words for noble minds
Show me a love for life
Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day

Once I had a friend that I could count
Times of need are not enough
Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
Once I saw a dream I had to chase
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Now let me close my eyes
Because I don't want to see anything anymore

Jennifer Lost The War

Jennifer lost the war today
You'll find her burned and raped
Through it all
She must have wondered
What have I done
But nobody really cares today
The world's a busy place
Guess she must have really sinned

I guess we're all just soldiers
She was only six years old
Left to die by strangers
Her family waits
And if we're all just soldiers
Is it so wrong to be afraid

Phoebe lost the war today
There must be some mistake
Say it happens all the time
And it's said and done
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed
Guess you must have really sinned

Morality won't help her
When she lies silent in a morgue
And all our sorrows just don't count at all
But will the morning headlines
Even say that it's a shame
What are we heading' for

Seen it all before
Silent on the ground
As he's walking away
And I wonder how many more
Everybody takes it
Like it's nothing at all
Jennifer lost the war

Kick Him When He's Down

&#34;Hey, you're a riddle&#34; I say as I move aside
(Like I really need your advice)
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try but don't get a lot done

Living sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away
Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey, don't worry, I'll get along home alright

Hey, everybody's supposed to be the same
So how come they're so lame?
It's like taking a fall
Keep on running back into that wall
Awake in a dream, get up and go to work
But I'm feeling like such a jerk
Like I said before
Little men come when everything goes

&#34;Hey, you're a riddle&#34; I say as I move aside
(Like I really need your advice)
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try, but don't get a lot done

Living in sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes

Kill The President

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the President
Listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power
Of the government
A leader's not the center
Of democracy

In a world without leaders
Who'd make people starve?
The world that we're saving
Will always be ours

Everyone says
Well maybe I'll make a difference
Thinking they've got plenty of time
But you're squeezed
A little tighter everyday
Punished before you can commit a crime

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the President
Listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power
Of the government
A leader's not the center
Of democracy

America
All of your enemies
Come from within
But you lash out so
It is seen
Like some frightened child
In an angry world
Or the fall of Rome
Your demise comes
From your own hands

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

In a world without leaders
We might have a chance
But we'll never see it
As long as there's

Killboy Powerhead

He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenchin' up his shit
He just a Killboy Powerhead...yeah
You know I saw his woman
She was writing his name in blood
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
She said she was his baby
Who looked just like the Hoover Dam
You know I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
He just a Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead...yeah

L.A.P.D.

When cops are taking care of business I can understand
But the L.A. story's gone way out of hand
Their acts of aggression, they say they're justified
But it seems an obsession has started from the inside
They're shooting anyone who even tries to run
They're shooting little kids with toy guns
Take it to a jury but they don't give a damn
Because the one who tells the truth is always the policeman

Beat all the niggers
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D.

The city of L.A. feels like a prison
With helicopters overhead and bullets wizzing by
Martial law ain't no solution
Police brutality's just social pollution

Beat all the white trash
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D.

Leave It Behind

Rage burns can't push it aside now
Can't forgive this grudge is alive now
All the rage eats you up inside
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

What a surprise
You're fucked with again yeah
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set
And I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long
But you were so dead wrong

What a surprise
You're fucked with again yeah
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set
And I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long
But you were so dead wrong

Me And My Old Lady

Me and my old lady
Lay in bed all day
When I say I love her
Well she rolls the other way
Really she don't mean it
Everything she says
Still if I believe in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong in my head

Me and my old lady
Sit and sip on wine
When she says she loves me
Well, I say that love is blind
Really I don't mean it
Everything I say
Still if she believes in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong wi</pre>
