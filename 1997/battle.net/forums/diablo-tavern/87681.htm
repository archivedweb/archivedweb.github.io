<pre>Hello diablo players out there,

Alright, to the story.  Well, I thought I would get another level 
with a new character I made last night.  Being level six, I looked at 
the public games running.  Hmm, two games.  One was made by a lvl 7 
with three dots and the other held the name, &#34;Give items!&#34;  I 
didn't have much of a choice so I thought, might as well make a game 
and see if anyone shows up.  So, in the spirit of my character name, 
Michael Meyers, I created, &#34;Haddonfield, Illinois.&#34;  I go 
into the dungeon and start hacking away at creatures until lvl 2.  At 
this point, the lag increases tremendously.  I think to myself, 
&#34;Hmm, maybe someone's joining...&#34;  The lag continued with no 
sign of any other player.  There was then a long period of lag, (I 
assumed there was a ghost and he had gotten dropped.)  and after 
that, it ceased.  Hmm, well, on with the game...  About thirty 
seconds pass and I'm faced with great lag again.  The ghost has 
returned!  I wait around for a couple of seconds and jump out of the 
game.  I hurriedly click on join.  The screen comes up and, well what 
do ya know?  The player with 3 dots at lvl 7's game is no longer on 
the board and it appears that my game is still running!  But there's 
no one there, or so it seems.  If you're going to try to pk me in 
ghost form, I'd advise you to have better lag.  Well, this just adds 
to the theory that cheaters really are dumb.  Well, haha, thanks for 
reading.  I'll see ya in the kitchen, with a knife.... hehe.</pre>
