<pre>  Actually, I have no idea why she did it.  I missed the start of the 
whole deal because I was the only one in the whole joint who was 
minding his own business.  But it was probably her fault--and, 
believe me, I'm gettin' mighty tired of being her apologist.  She was 
in high spirits after about a week of lucrative pillage in some ruins 
outside this (literally) god-forsaken town called Tristram and seemed 
determined to blow half of her haul on nasty, rank domestic ale in 
the local tavern, one of the few buildings fit for human habitation.  
&#34;Ogden's Tavern,&#34; the sign said.  Never heard of Tristram?  
Well, you haven't missed much.  The place is overrun with a rat-pack 
of thieves, mercenaries, murderers and lunatics come to loot the 
ruins (and each other), and the only locals left are getting rich off 
the lot of them.
  Anyway, we were sitting at this wobbly little table in the middle 
of the room.  I wasn't too happy about that--I like to sit against 
the wall, especially in a dive like this--but it was the only one 
empty when we got there.  She was drinking, and I was eating 
something Mr. Ogden claimed was food and trying not to look at her.  
It was hard.  Ever see something so ugly it's fascinating?  That's my 
sister drinking.  Back she'd go, daring that flimsy chair not to 
break, and hoist up this big wooden mug the size of her head.  Ogden 
always holds those mugs way down under the tap so this dirty-yellow 
head of foam comes rolling up out the top, hiding the fact that the 
thing is only half full.  All that foam and half the ale would come 
oozing down her cheeks, neck and chest, the foam stringing out in 
greasy clumps that would slide as far as the top of her bra, the ale 
streaking on past, down her belly and into her breechcloth.  Once the 
bottom of the mug was pointed at the ceiling she'd shake it over her 
mouth a while to get the last drops into her ears and hair, then sit 
up and slap it down on the table, fixing me with a stupid, glassey-
eyed smile, which was my cue to fetch her another.
  Like I said, I was trying my best not to look at all this (not that 
the other drunken thugs were much to look at--I ended up watching a 
rat scratch its ear in the shadow of a beer-barrel), but 'round about 
her sixth she slapped that thing down hard enough to jump the meat 
off my trencher.  I spun around and my eyes lit on her chest.  The 
ale had left clean streaks in her skin that showed how filthy she 
was, but what really got to me was the bra.  The leather was 
saturated with that vile brew and all the funk it carried with it off 
her unwashed body.  I was beside myself.  &#34;Who do you think has 
to clean that, bonehead!&#34; I thought.  Then Mom's words came back 
to me.  &#34;It's a brother's duty to serve his sister!&#34;  I could 
feel my ears start to burn with anger, but I struggled to put on a 
respectful expression before looking her in the eye--Sis HATES things 
that defy her will.
  I think she could tell I was upset.  She looked back at me with her 
wet, drunken smile (she never smiles when she's sober) her head 
bobbing faintly, then nodded forward to survey her slimy front.  
After some thought she decided to wipe away the streaks with her 
palms, which she managed after a couple minutes of clumsy self-
groping (this drew some looks from other tables).  Finished, she sat 
back up and regarded me, pride of accomplishment evident in her 
expression.  She was now uniformly coated from nose to navel in a 
sickening gray glaze of ale, dirt, and old sweat.  Not wanting to 
look at her face any more, my gaze returned to the near-ruined bra.  
Puzzled by my evident lack of admiration, she looked down again and, 
presently realizing what step she had skipped, made it good, wringing 
out the sopping bra as best she could with it still on, ale dribbling 
down her belly to ruin her earlier handiwork (this drew more looks).
  Twin waves of nausea and fatigue washed through me.  &#34;How can 
those guys stand to look at that?&#34; I wondered as I stood and 
turned to pass her empty tankard and five more gold quietly to Ogden. 
 Well, I suppose they had seen far worse sights in the ruins, being 
&#34;adventurers&#34; and all, and obviously none of them had ever 
squatted for an hour in an ice-cold creek trying to pound filth out 
of a bra with a flat rock.  Mulling this over, I made my way back to 
the table, careful not to spill too much foam out of ale #7.  When I 
got there, the fight was already in the making.
  So, like I said, I've got no idea who started it.  All I remember 
is that there were two warrior types standing by her chair, one of 
them holding this natty old towel, and a third by mine, sipping his 
ale and looking like he fixing to sit down.  Oh, no you don't!  Quick 
and smooth, I was back on it, leaving him glowering behind me as I 
passed the mug to Sis. Now to find something else to look at...  I 
decided to try to salvage some of the food that had launched off my 
trencher, and soon became absorbed in scraping dirt off a drumstick.  
I might have stayed absorbed too, if her new audience hadn't make so 
much racket cheering her on.  They were all pretty buzzed.  Out of 
the corner of my eye I caught her just finishing up, all glistening 
with a fresh coat, foam clods sticking out of her face like giant 
warts.
  I  felt like I was gonna heave for real this time, but something 
happened that made my year: Warrior #1 quit clapping, and with a big, 
pig-eatin' grin on his face, stepped right up and STARTED TOWELING 
HER GRUNGY BOD OFF!!  I almost wept.  In my whole young life I have 
NEVER seen anyone try anything like that with her, at least 
voluntarily.  Even Mom would sometimes &#34;forget&#34; about bath-
time for Sis to spare herself the kicking, and screaming, and biting, 
and bleeding that went with it.  Still, &#34;...and you make sure she 
bathes, young man--at least once a month.  Do you understand me?&#34; 
was the last thing Mom said as we left for Khanduras. The onus had 
been on me ever since.  Now this drunken boob was stepping up to take 
my lumps for me.
  Disappointingly, she didn't raise a hand to the fellow, she just 
looked down stupidly as he started in on her chest.  Well, it 
figures.  I guess she doesn't care if you dry her off, but believe me-
-it would have been a different scene if dude was trying to get her 
IN some water.  He tried to dry her bra off for the longest time 
(what a fool--everybody knows you can't dry leather with a towel).  
Finally, she started laughing at him, spraying what ale she had left 
in her mouth into his face (which made him scowl for a moment) then 
snatched the towel out of his hands and started drying his face off.  
I lost interest at this stage and returned my attention to the 
drumstick.  When I looked up next, they were already brawling.  Don't 
ask me why--they seemed to be getting along pretty well to me.
  Anyway, Warrior #1 had her arms pinned to her sides and Warrior #2 
was coming up behind her looking like he was going to throw a choke 
on her.  &#34;Yeah, thump her!&#34; I was thinking, but no such luck. 
 A couple quick jerks of the arms and she had Warrior #1 by both 
wrists, and OW! elbows aren't supposed to bend that way!  His upper 
body pitched forward fast, to take the pressure off and she bent in 
to meet him.  CRAK!!!  Her forehead smashed into his nose with savage 
force leaving it bent against his cheek, a small pink spur of bone 
protruding from the skin where it used to be.  #1 let out an odd, 
thin wheeze and flopped over.  So ended his evening.
  Warrior #2 was much better at fist fighting and knew enough to 
cover up, jab, and use his superior stamina against her.  What style! 
 Sis threw kick after kick, but he saw 'em all coming, let 'em bounce 
off a forearm or shoulder, and sent her back with a jab for her 
trouble.  Soon she was bruised, bleeding, and almost winded.  All she 
could do was try to sucker him, which she did, and he fell for it.  
She faked slipping while trying to do a sweep and when he charged in 
to finish her with his boots, up came a heel, up under his guard and 
up under his ribcage.  uuUUUhh!  Up came supper too.  On her feet 
again, she seized him by the jaw and started slamming her fist into 
his face with a slow, easy rhythm:  
WHOK!.....WHOK!.....WHOK!.....WHOK!.....WHOK!.....
  Understandably, Warrior #3, the last of the trio who had spent all 
this time drinking and cheering on his buds, was not going to stand 
around and watch one of them get pounded into a coma.  So he stepped 
around my chair and started creeping up on her, dagger in hand.
  Well, what can I say?  Mom never said I had to bring her back 
alive.  On the other hand, I wouldn't care to face her with &#34;I 
hate her, so I let some dude stick her in a bar fight;&#34; nor would 
I be likely to come up with a good lie.  Nothing gets by Mom.  So I 
had to go against my convictions: I stuck out my leg and tripped up 
#3.  Clatter, clatter, went the dagger on the floor.
  And that's all I saw of last night's brawl.  I took cover behind 
some barrels so I didn't get to see the interesting part.  Naked 
steel having been produced, everyone there drew his own weapon or 
intoned some defensive spell.  I suppose it just naturally escalated 
into a free for all.  It could have happened anywhere with a crowd 
like this.  You can't blame Sis.</pre>
