<pre>Profit is all that matters to Blizzard, and your idea just ain't 
profitable:

1) ...they've already bilked enough money out of Diablo.

2) ...they are about to bilk even moer when Starcraft comes out

3) ...UO is going coming out; who cares about Diablo?

4) ...they might as well wait a few years, watch UO, and see how they 
can create an even better Diablo (Diablo 2? Ba'al? Mephisto?).

&#62; hello,
&#62;          First, The Man did a booboo on his exp.. it is 10K exp per 
&#62; kill in hell hell level 13-16.  And.. Blizzard is always changing 
&#62; their minds on the exp from which things at this level.. I have a 
&#62; legit level 50 and I get 10k exp from ANY monster in hell/hell.
&#62;          Ok, on to my main thingie.. ok.. I need suggestions on 
&#62; something.. a friend of mine and I were thinking.. since Diablo is 
&#62; pretty much dead (pun intended), why not make an add-on?  Well that 
&#62; is just what we plan on doing.. we are going to try at least heh.. 
&#62; its gonna take a lot of friends to put it in gear.. and the 
&#62; occasional OK from Blizzard (PLEEEAAASSEEEEEEEEE) to maybe have it 
&#62; playable on bnet.. ok.. heres the thing.. we need major suggestions.. 
&#62; we are thinking of maybe having the town change a little maybe to 
&#62; that town that you go to after you get that soul stone jammed in your 
&#62; head (i dont remember because I havent watched that boring movie 
&#62; since I got my 3rd dot back in 1.02) and have a few monster changes ( 
&#62; a little harder with different strengths and weaknesses.. maybe apoc 
&#62; immune monsters since some cheaters just have no talent and have to 
&#62; apoc their way through hell ) and maybe character class changes.. 
&#62; different skills and such ( new spells would take too long to work 
&#62; out bugs ).. and of course a new weapon type or two like something 
&#62; bow of the somethingelse or whatever.. but as I said.. we need your 
&#62; suggestions.. blizzards ok and of course proper funding unless we 
&#62; have friends who owe us BIG favors heh but we will find a way to put 
&#62; this through some way or another.
