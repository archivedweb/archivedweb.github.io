<pre>join either the Underground warlords, or it's subguild,
cabal!   the warlords are a mafia guild, and cabal is a
group of players who will specialize in learning about
magic.  i guess the warlords will pump people full of holes
with our tommy guns, and then the cabal will fireball 
them.  hehe

my mafia guild doesn't just allow you to play out your 
fantasy of being a big time gangster, but the Crimson
Alliance, with 1000 people will give you protectioon


LATE BREAKING NEWS: The Crimson Alliance has reached
at about 1000 members, don't be left out!!
i'm gonna take this opportunity to tell you about a really 
kewl ultima online guild that i would like
you to consider joining.  

the guild is called the UNDERGROUND WARLORDS.
we are an organized crime family in the game
ultima online. 
 
our clan is not a random pkilling clan like most of
the other's out there.  we live by a code of conduct, and
we are too sophisticated to kill people for no reason 
anyways.  guilds that just go around killing innocent
people are like street gangs.  we are trying to be more
like mafia type gangs.  our style is doesn't let us kill
unless we do it for business, or unless someone insults 
us.  the idea is that this is a role playing game, and it
should let you play the role of the people you always
wanted to imitate.  kinda like a holodeck.   

for business, we will run rackets, extort business owners,
run gambling rings, maybe even prostitution rings.  we will 
also do legal work like blacksmithing, of course.  we might
go up to a business owner and tell him that if he doesn't 
pay his protection money every week, we won't be able to
protect him, and bad things might happen.  hehehe.  
i was  thinking about getting a pirate group together,
and charge tariffs for other ships sailing our waters.

as for new members, we are looking for high quality 
players who will participate when the game comes out, and
will fit in with our family.  we have had 300+ applicants,
but so far, only about 85 people have been found to have
what it takes to join the family.  so as you can see, we
are putting a heavy emphasis on quality over quantity.

our webpage is <a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192">http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192</a>
trust me when i tell you that this is one of the best 
uo webpages out there.  it won an award for it too, and is 
maintained daily, so it is very up to date.  even if you decide
not to join us, i urge you to look at the page, it is really kewl.   

because we are trying to act out the parts of and organized
crime family, we need three things.  organization, crime, of 
course, and a sense of family.  through bulletin boards,
free chat programs... our guild members are very well 
connected  (excuse the pun  hehe).
 
we will live the good life like mafia people in the past,
like Al Capone, John Gotti...  we will have nice suits, 
and many women.  we will look down at all the pathetic
trashy losers that live in the city streets which we control,
and kids will look up to us as thier heroes.  maybe, if
business is good enough, we might do what capone
did, and open soup kitchens for the bums.  hehehe (who
ever said that the mafia was all bad?  we just want the
right to free enterprise, which the law really prohibits 
these days.)
   
so far, we have friendships with many other guilds,
and are allied with a few as well.  

come on, guys, join, and we'll take over the underworld!

                                              Urfriend  
                                             A.K.A.  Pkill_me

PS  WE HAVE JUST BECOME PART OF THE CRIMSON 
ALLIANCE, ONE OF THE MOST MOST POWERFUL
ALLIANCES IN UO!  The average guild in this alliance
has about 150-200 members, so with about 6 guilds, this 
alliance probably has about 900-1000 members.  and these
are high quality guilds who have people who actually 
participate too, so it will probably seem like even more 
than other alliances who just take anybody who might
not even play!

well, just come and look at out webpage at:
<a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192">http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192</a>
it can't hurt just to look at the page, and i promise
you, this is one of the better webpages out there!</pre>
