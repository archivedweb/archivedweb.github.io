<pre>I agree with Kari that it is up to you, but let me just share my 
experience with hand-me-downs.

I have an additional Mage character, Diago.  I had gotten him to 
about 10th level or so and put him in mothballs to concentrate on 
Iago.

Eventually, as everyone does, Iago got in over her head and managed 
to lose all her equipment.  No biggy, just a lot of treasure hunts.  
During one of these, she found Naj's Light Plate.  A fantastic find!  
She now had decent armor and extra spell levels, too.

Eventually she found better armor (Saintly plate or such) and out 
grew the Naj's Light Plate (not high enough AC for a rogue).  Not 
wanting to let such a great item go to waste, she handed it down to 
Diago along with a ring of sorcery.

Well, to make a short story long, I've been rethinking that decision. 
  Building up Diago has not been as much fun as building up Iago.  
Running through the church and cats was too easy.  No challenge.  But 
Diago needed some further levels and spells would help.  So I needed 
to find books.

Diago is now 20th level and has found chain lightning and fireball.  
I don't feel the need to hunt spells as much and am ready to 
challenge him.  He'll probably always use the Naj's light plate to 
gain the extra level for spells.

My point, and I do have one (Thank you Ellen Degeneres), is that it 
really takes away from what the game should be.  In hindsight, I 
don't think I would do it again.  Gifting and hand-me-downs detract 
from the game.

My 2 cents, which turn out to be about a quarters worth.

P.S.  Inferno, please try to come up with another channel for your 
escapades.  We don't appreciate our channel being used as a backup.
Thanks.</pre>
