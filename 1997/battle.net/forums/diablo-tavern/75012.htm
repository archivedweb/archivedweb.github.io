&#62; Well, as I've said before, I find you people very amusing. VERY 
&#62; FUNNY, VERY AMUSING!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; I love you people that come on here and spout a bunch of crap about 
&#62; stuff you know nothing about. Well, here are some of my beefs ----
&#62; 
&#62; 1. What the hell is it with you people??? Not all PKs are cheats, got 
&#62; it? just becuase we killed you doesn't mean we use God-Mode. It's 
&#62; just a lie you people make up to make it look like we wouldn't be 
&#62; able to kill you any other way. As a matter of fact, I doubt if
&#62; there is as many cheating Pks as people think. Most of cheats on
&#62; B.Net are guys who have no lifes or want to kill PKs, which proves
&#62; my point that some of you people are just downright afraid of PKs.

Not ALL Pkers are cheaters, but I would wager about 75&#37; are.

&#62; 2. PKing is not cheating.

I agree, but Pkers who lie to people to gain their trust and then 
kill them are just as bad as cheaters, IMO.
 
&#62; 3. BadBoys, you people are not cool. Noone finds your little raids 
&#62; into the Inferno channel humorous, it is just stupid. It proves your 
&#62; immaturity and that you all act like childs. And also, &#34;Your 
&#62; Momma&#34; jokes are not funny.

BadBoys do suck, but come on, you gotta admit, some &#34;your 
momma&#34; are damn funny.

&#62; 4. I hate that stupid dog Kathie Lee Gifford. Her kid Cody is 
&#62; annoying.

I really don't care.
 
&#62; 5. I find it funny that whenever some person makes a valid arguement 
&#62; on this BB, some of you just say they are 13 year olds going through 
&#62; puberty. I am sick and tired of people saying &#34;Well, Inferno are 
&#62; just a bunch of 13 year olds!!&#34; How the @#&#37;$ would you 
&#62; know??? Most of you stupid @#&#37;$s that come into Inferno and spam 
&#62; don't even know us. I guess that you people are just plain jerks.
&#62; GET A LIFE.

They may not be 13 physically, but they're definitely 13 mentally.

&#62; 6. The people that post on here just to get attention. They come on 
&#62; here with no friends and they think they can become good friends
&#62; with every persoon if they just say &#34;Inferno Suxs&#34;. 
&#62; You people don't even know us, so bug off.

At least they're not as bad as everyone who wastes post space just 
writing &#34;test&#34; or other such drivel.

&#62; 7. Will all you people starting new guilds stop it? You're too late 
&#62; into this game to do anything. You will not make a difference.

Let them have their fun, man.

&#62; Well, I'm mad, and that's what I have to say. If you're wondering 
&#62; about the title, I didn't know what to put, so I put down the first 
&#62; thing that came to mind.

Just let it all out.  Let the anger flow; and if there's any left, 
use it to go and waste Diablo.  Have Fun.
