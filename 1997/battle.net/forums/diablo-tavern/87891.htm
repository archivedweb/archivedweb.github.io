<pre>WOW!!! I finally logged on!! I swear to GOD, you can get lost in that 
game. Here's how it went-

I started with my Neophyte Mage Tyrael at the Wayfarers Inn in 
Britain. I walked inside, but no one was around. I then started 
getting familiar with the control. Right button to move, double 
clicks to activate, left click to look- that type of stuff. First 
off, the lag really bothered me. Then, I started do get used to it 
and it started being not that bad. 
So, I was getting used to the controls, when I decided to look at 
stuff in my inventory. I gots crap. Just a spell book, clothes and a 
knife. Didn't even know how to open the damn backpack. I changed my 
text colour to deep blue. There's a million different colours of text 
to choose from. So, I was thinking I was king of the hill when I was 
in fact a big newbie. I ran around Britain for about 20 minutes 
before I ran into an NPC. Boy, are they stupid. They're good at 
directions and stuff, but not at small talk.
Well, I then finally ran into my official first character talking 
player guy (for lack of a better word). His name was Goshien, and he 
was a newbie too. We decided to team up and explore around Britain. 
SO, I started trying to talk to this NPC for directions while he 
decided to practice his fine art of sitting on his ass. The NPC, 
after much talking, told me where to go to find Castle British. I 
thought &#34;Cool, I'll knock boots with the rich and famous!&#34;
!@#$&#37;^& wouldn't let me in the bloody castle! As much as I tried, 
they would not let me in. All the gaurds kept saying were &#34;Thou 
will regret thine actions, swine!&#34; and stuff like that.
So, denied access to Castle British, me and Goshien started hitting 
on this gypsy chick called Lydia. Stupid @!@#$ ran off on us. Denied, 
in a game... how sad....
But still, the wierdest thing I saw, and I swear to God I'm not 
making this up, is a talking mushroom.
Yes, a talking mushroom. He was shouting things off while I sat there 
and tried to talk to Mushroom Man. Mushrooms are not great 
conversationalists.
Well, that's about it. After that I ran around but crashed. So ends 
part 2 of My Adventures in UO. Tomorrow's an other day...

Take it easy,
Tyrael
I AM THE TIGER</pre>
