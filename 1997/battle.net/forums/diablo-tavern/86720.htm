&#62; Ya I may be wrong about Masters bow... but I don't remember anything 
&#62; better then Warriors... anyway.. Emerald items ARE findable! I found 
&#62; several Emerald shields and couple of Emerald bows by myself! I also 
&#62; SEEMED to remeber having a Platinum or even Mithril ring LOONG time 
&#62; ago... not sure if I remeber correctly.. most probably I am wrong.. 
&#62; anyway, I strongly believe that Ring of Stars in ver. 1 was up to 15! 
&#62; YES! I do remeber it! I found my ring of Stars on Normal hell and it 
&#62; was +15 to all! I think Everybody remebers his FIRST cool ring... I 
&#62; doubt U ever FOUND Godly Cloak.. see godly is from same range with 
&#62; Kings... I find king's iems almost each Laz run! Damn! I even found 
&#62; Great King's axe of Bashing recently! 12-30 +100 to hit +158 damage.. 
&#62; so? I never seen any damn Godly robe from ANYBODY! Well I don't 
&#62; usually ID every robe I find, but I do ID most of helms caps and 
&#62; Shields! And compare to Ided swords and persentage of IDed King's 
&#62; swores... well anyway... if U find another Holly molly or Godly 
&#62; shmodly armor take a pic while Iding it... Grrr... I pretty much 
&#62; think BLZ tech dupport guys are full of shit.... see.. U ask them 
&#62; question and their answers are kinda: Keep looking guys! Emerald 
&#62; Jewelry? WTF? Who ever SEEN ANY single EMERALD ring of ANYTHING? NO 
&#62; one! Who ever found PLAIN emerald ring? And BLizzard tech support 
&#62; responded to guy kinda: Keep looking! I seen McVay's question to 
&#62; Blizzard about Godly plate of ANYTHING... he gave them calculations 
&#62; of odds him finding a godly plate... well.... u can guess what they 
&#62; answered.. keep looking on deeper levels of dungeon... BTW... one 
&#62; more thing about Wirt: HE NEVER offered me ANYTHING for more then 
&#62; 140000! NEVER!!!! He keeps his prices under 140000 so does Grizwold! 
&#62; So there is NO actual way of getting Godly plate of Osmosis from 
&#62; anybody or anywhere! See I think most of Legit players were 
&#62; CONSTANTLY BShitted by cheaters or half cheaters.. U know.. this lill 
&#62; &#34;hey I found this! Honest!&#34; Only thing I can say they 
&#62; probably TOO addicted to their hacks and dupes to dump them! Yes, I 
&#62; remeber od times when GPOWs and GPOAs just appeared! It was all of a 
&#62; sudden! Just after Enigma's trainer allowed gold cheat! Damn! Since 
&#62; then GPOW's and GPOA's started popping as mushrooms! Then there was a 
&#62; quiet period during which everyone had SAME Godly plates... Let me 
&#62; remind most popular plates in OLD ages:
&#62; GPOA
&#62; Godly plate of the Mammoth
&#62; Holy Plate of the mammoth
&#62; Godly plate of the Whale
&#62; Godly plate of Osmosis
&#62; I seen most of them! I been when they first appeared.... Now there 
&#62; are like 6 variants of GPOW.... I still think all Godly plates and 
&#62; such came from Single player! Cmon! It's believable! Look.... U make 
&#62; level 99 character in Single player(so Wirt sells u GOOD stuff), and 
&#62; Unlimited gold, then u just go back and forth buying items and 
&#62; dropping them on ground! If anybody who played Single player can 
&#62; enlighten me about pricing policy there, we can Clarify this 
&#62; thing(from what I know Pricing policy should be VERY diferent) Then u 
&#62; Use Hex to track down code which is very easy... U need just make a 
&#62; copy of character's file before u buy plate and then compare two 
&#62; files... so U know how's Plate looks, then U just copy sequence and 
&#62; replace several numbers in Multyplayer..(I have NO idea how item 
&#62; encoding works in Diablo, but That's EXACTLY what I would do or try 
&#62; to do if I wanted to hack Diablo by myself...) That might explain 
&#62; Durability and charges hack.. it's certainly coded in game engine to 
&#62; recognise CERTAIN items with FIXED stats, so U cannot have Broad 
&#62; sword with 30-50 basic damage.. however Durability and Staff charges 
&#62; are variable(not only by shrines, but also by repair and by 
&#62; recharging staves by your warrior or sorcerer) So u just copy file 
&#62; with your character, then cast several apocs in EMPTY place and then 
&#62; compare two files... U figure which number is responsible for charges 
&#62; and change it to 255... I think there should be two numbers tho... 
&#62; one responsible for MAX charges and one for current charges, so U may 
&#62; want to recharge stave to figure where BOTH numbers are.. NOTE I 
&#62; never DID this thing and NOT intended to do! I think cheating kills 
&#62; fun in game ... it's only a game right? But I had little hacking 
&#62; expirience in Russia and I have couple of Professional Hacker friends 
&#62; there with who I hanged around...(I never understood what they were 
&#62; talking about anyway.. )And that's pretty much HOW I would start to 
&#62; hack a game like Diablo.... I would suggest next time Blizzard make a 
&#62; jumping code for saved characters! I seen one game protected this 
&#62; way.. and ONLY VERY good hacker can actually HACK this game and 
&#62; what's MOST important it cannot be MASS thing... see this way U 
&#62; encript character's stats using a key word, so let's say u use a 
&#62; random keyword from 5-8 letters from characters name 5-8 is because U 
&#62; use different number of letters every time! Well program which was 
&#62; encripted this way was hacked in Russia by several programmers...and 
&#62; it wasn't GAME... so they actually worked for money.. I would love to 
&#62; see any of MODERN hackers who hack diablo to deal with this 
&#62; thing...for free.. I also suggest compressing saved file, so 
&#62; comparing will give nothing... now THAT would be a TASK! a challenge 
&#62; for a hacker! Ya.. there are MANY ways to keep game cheat free even 
&#62; with character saved on users HD... question if U want to make it 
&#62; cheat free... or if U want to collect money and forget about it!


I am going to confirm everything u guys have benn sayng about rings. 
First to inform u i have 4 storage characters filled with many 
different rings i have found in dungon. The most prominent prefixes 
for levels 1-4 are:

brass
bronze
iron
steel
tin
white

4-8 are:

azure
drakes
ivory
jade (rarely)
lapis
pearl
silver
crimson
topaz

9-12 are:

basically the above, they dont change very much accept jade are a 
little less rare. Also u start finding amber.


13-16 are:

obsidian
diamond
crystal
dragons
garnet
ruby
sapphire
gold




I presonally have never ever seen an emerald ring. They just are 
found! I myself have found emerald bows and shield though. Obsidian 
rings can't be found anywhere accept hell!!! It just doesnt happen. I 
laff when u guys say &#34;oh well i found this obsidian ring of 
zodiac on level 8&#34;. I might be wrong though :)


These are prefixes u will never find and i spit on people who say 
they do:

awesome
hydra's
strange
wyrm's
wierd
meriless
burgundy (yet to see one)
arch angels
