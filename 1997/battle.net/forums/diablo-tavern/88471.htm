&#62; Hello my friends,
&#62;      This poem has nothing to do with diablo, I just like it.  It  is 
&#62; a classic.  You can get the rhythm even after all these years. It was 
&#62; written in the mid 1800's. Enjoy, and put the kiddies to bed. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
&#62; Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
&#62;  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
&#62;  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
&#62;  '' 'Tis some visitor,'' I muttered, ''tapping at my chamber door-
&#62;                 Only this, and nothing more.'' 
&#62;   Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
&#62;   And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
&#62;  Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
&#62;  From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
&#62;  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
&#62;                          Nameless here for evermore. 
&#62;    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
&#62;   Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
&#62;    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
&#62;    '' 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
&#62;  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
&#62;                          This it is, and nothing more.'' 
&#62;   Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
&#62; ''Sir,'' said I, ''or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
&#62;    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
&#62;   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
&#62;  That I scarce was sure I heard you''- here I opened wide the door;-
&#62;                        Darkness there, and nothing more. 
&#62;   Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, 
&#62; fearing,
&#62;  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
&#62;  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
&#62;  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ''Lenore!''
&#62;   This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ''Lenore!''-
&#62;                 Merely this, and nothing more. 
&#62;  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
&#62;  Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
&#62;  ''Surely,'' said I, ''surely that is something at my window lattice:
&#62;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-
&#62;  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-
&#62;                  'Tis the wind and nothing more.'' 
&#62;    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
&#62;  In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
&#62;    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
&#62;   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-
&#62;   Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-
&#62;                            Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
&#62;   Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
&#62;  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
&#62;   ''Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,'' I said, ''art sure 
&#62; no craven,
&#62;   Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-
&#62;  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!''
&#62;                               Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;   Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
&#62;   Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;
&#62;    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
&#62;  Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-
&#62;  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
&#62;                             With such name as ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
&#62;  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
&#62;  Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-
&#62;  Till I scarcely more than muttered, ''other friends have flown 
&#62; before-
&#62;   On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.''
&#62;                      Then the bird said, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62; Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
&#62;  ''Doubtless,'' said I, ''what it utters is its only stock and store,
&#62;  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
&#62;   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-
&#62;  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
&#62;                       Of 'Never- nevermore'.'' 
&#62; But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
&#62; Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and 
&#62; door;
&#62; Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
&#62;   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
&#62; What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
&#62;                       Meant in croaking ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
&#62;  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
&#62; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
&#62;     But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
&#62;               She shall press, ah, nevermore! 
&#62; Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
&#62;   Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
&#62;   ''Wretch,'' I cried, ''thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he 
&#62;                             hath sent thee
&#62;  Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!
&#62;  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!''
&#62;                           Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;  ''Prophet!'' said I, ''thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or 
&#62; devil!-
&#62; Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
&#62;   Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-
&#62; On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-
&#62;   Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!''
&#62;                           Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;    ''Prophet!'' said I, ''thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or 
&#62; devil!
&#62;   By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-
&#62;      Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
&#62;    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
&#62;   Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.''
&#62;                              Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;   ''Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,'' I shrieked, 
&#62; upstarting-
&#62;   ''Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
&#62;  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
&#62;    Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
&#62;     Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
&#62;                         door!''
&#62;               Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
&#62;   And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
&#62;    On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
&#62;   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
&#62; And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
&#62;    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
&#62;                                         Shall be lifted- nevermore! 
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. How basic the rhythm of the poem, don't you think?  Yet so 
&#62; inviting, and so captivating.  Goodnight my friends, hope the morning 
&#62; bring with it something more.  Forgive the lack of Diablo relation. :)
