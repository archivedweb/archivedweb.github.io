<pre>Well, I never really got a chance to prove my own high opinion of 
myslef untill now(except for killing AI monsters).  I fought a level 
35 (me a 31 then) sorceror and won twice.  I can't really commit a 
mindless pk but LEGIT DUELING ROCKS!!! And thats why I made this clan 
so that I can wage guild wars(not sensless anymore) and co-op (maybe 
keep the hopes of legits alive also). Later, because of my enjoyment 
of this duel I joined a game called &#34;DUEL LEGIT ONLY&#34; well as 
soon as I joined the guy who made the game left (I think his name was 
death something). Well another guy (warrior) was there at the time 
(SIR.EP or something like that). So being naturally self preserving I 
asked by the first guy left and later if the guy is legit (his answer 
was &#34;UMMMM&#34;) and whether he wants to duel (answer was yes). 
Well I ask him to take off any gnarled root rings and butcher cleaver 
rings and he supposedly does so (this guy has more then 700 health). 
So another mage joins (also prob not legit but I could be wrong, he 
had mana shield on so I couldn't tell godmode or not) and after a 
while another warrior joined.  So once I go down Sir Ep lets me put 
on mana shield and the duel begins eventually ending with me winning 
(the guy never came close to hitting me with his sword although he 
had all the spells like teleport). Then the other sorceror comes down 
(I think his name was NECROMANCER although it was in someway 
misspelled) and he joins in the fight too (he tells the warrior that 
he has 400 AC and thats why he can't even hit him even after he put 
his gnarled root and butcher rings back on).  I survive for a while 
almost dying a couple of times. While finally the last warrior comes 
down and I see that he has 2000 health points (Slash something was 
his name) and no mana shield (DUELS LEGIT ONLY still is the name of 
the game btw). So everyone seems to gang up on this guy and no one 
can hurt him (he also had all the spells). Eventually he casts a 
fireball that hits me  ( my mana shield being full and at about 580 
points) and kills me with one shot. I get ressed and then I continue 
the fight asking the guy to turn off his godmode and lower his spell 
levels he says nothing.  So onnce again I'm teleporting around like 
crazy doging fireballs when he teleports close to me and hits me 
while at the same time I teleport so I die a bit away from him. I get 
ressed by him and he proceedes to fireball me suprisinglyy doing no 
damage even with his sword (I'll have to investigate this further). 
So just my luck that a skeleton comes up and hits me once and bam all 
my stuff falls off on top of the gold that I droped previously (my 
obsidian gothic plate gets eaten, all my resistances gone).  I'm a 
bit sad, but suprisingly not angry (the guy taught me that I don't 
mind being killed by a cheater as much as I used to). I pick up all 
my rings and spkied club of the heavens and town portal out of there. 
 Which basically proves my point that ANY LEGIT(lv 30 and up) COULD 
KILL ANY CHEATER THAT HAS NO GODMODE ON. Face it we legits are just 
way better then dupers who just stand there and click (even the mages 
and rogues have KSOH). This seems to make my clan a little bit more 
powerfull (it being a pk and duper hunter thing) in the final war 
between cheaters and legits. 

Come on godmoders turn the damned thing off. What fun is it when your 
opponent dies with one hit? Geez you are so powerfull that we don't 
even want to play with you...
