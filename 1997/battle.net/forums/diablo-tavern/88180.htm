&#62; So I was playing with this other warrior today, and we cleared the 
&#62; caves without to much trouble so we decided to try hell.  Along the 
&#62; way I had found some plate armor (no bonuses, but hey, plate) and I 
&#62; had a sheild, sword, and helm of the moon.  So we go into hell and I 
&#62; cast a portal right away in case we had to bail ... good plan right?  
&#62; Wrong!  The first group of monsters (some kind of drakes)hit me so 
&#62; fast and hard that I didn't even have time to quit before I was dead. 
&#62;  The game picked the worst time to lag and that didn't help.  Oh 
&#62; well, back to the catacombs to get some new stuff and some money to 
&#62; upgrade my equipment.  Found a cool rouge to team up with: Thanks 
&#62; Godess, I especially appreciate the ring.  So now I have some lame-
&#62; ass studded leather and a sheild of fast block.  At least I found a 
&#62; good war hammer to replace the claymore which was all I could afford 
&#62; at the time.  Anyway I learned a valuable lesson, hell is a LONG step 
&#62; up from the caves ... maybe next time I'll get some revenge.  Kinda 
&#62; long, sorry about that ...
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Again, thanks Godess!


Croaker,

I know how you feel and I been through it before. He's my tip on 
leveling up. I'll use my Rogue for an exsample. When you level up, go 
into the caves for level 14-22 normal. After that, go into hell with 
an legit party. This way, you all got you backs covered. In hell, 
make sure you learn Fireball. Fireball, good armor and fast weapons 
is the key to surive hell. My rogue founded a Full Plate version of 
Glorius plate, an titan's Amulet, Topaz of the stars ring, Azuzra of 
the eagle ring, and a Mercless long battle bow (A member founded that 
in hell for me while I was in the caves). These items are good til 
level 15. Remember this.
