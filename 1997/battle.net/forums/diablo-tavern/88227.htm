<pre>hello,
         First, The Man did a booboo on his exp.. it is 10K exp per 
kill in hell hell level 13-16.  And.. Blizzard is always changing 
their minds on the exp from which things at this level.. I have a 
legit level 50 and I get 10k exp from ANY monster in hell/hell.
         Ok, on to my main thingie.. ok.. I need suggestions on 
something.. a friend of mine and I were thinking.. since Diablo is 
pretty much dead (pun intended), why not make an add-on?  Well that 
is just what we plan on doing.. we are going to try at least heh.. 
its gonna take a lot of friends to put it in gear.. and the 
occasional OK from Blizzard (PLEEEAAASSEEEEEEEEE) to maybe have it 
playable on bnet.. ok.. heres the thing.. we need major suggestions.. 
we are thinking of maybe having the town change a little maybe to 
that town that you go to after you get that soul stone jammed in your 
head (i dont remember because I havent watched that boring movie 
since I got my 3rd dot back in 1.02) and have a few monster changes ( 
a little harder with different strengths and weaknesses.. maybe apoc 
immune monsters since some cheaters just have no talent and have to 
apoc their way through hell ) and maybe character class changes.. 
different skills and such ( new spells would take too long to work 
out bugs ).. and of course a new weapon type or two like something 
bow of the somethingelse or whatever.. but as I said.. we need your 
suggestions.. blizzards ok and of course proper funding unless we 
have friends who owe us BIG favors heh but we will find a way to put 
this through some way or another.
