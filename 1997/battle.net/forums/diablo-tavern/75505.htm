<pre>     Hello, my name is Conan the barbarian and I am a legit 8 lv 
fighter. I roleplay when I play diablo( in case u don't know what 
this means [shame on you!] this means you actualy play diablo as the 
char. For example my fighter is not allowed to use magic equipment or 
read magic scrolls and he is a bit dense. He is over-confident, 
speaks in third person and worships Krom the god of barbarians.)
     I have developed a new way of dueling, one that displays the 
true skill of one's character, and lets u duel dupers on equal terms. 
Before I go on I must warn u FISTFIGHTING IS A FREINDLY  FORM OF 
DUELING this means u have to give back ears to the chalanged if u 
beat them, but have no right to keep your ear if u are the chalenger. 
Fistfights may also be for the first one to go undet ten if one of 
the parties does not wish to die (reputatiion, ect.) Also, a scroll 
of res must me used by people unable to cast this spell. Now for 
rules.
      All weapons, armour and equipment must be put in backpack and 
all cheats and magics are forbidden. U may bring one full or two 
partal  healing potions for every level the other player is above u. 
Do not fight people that outclass u with more than 3 lv as this is 
suicide. Then the two duelers (fistfights are only one on one 
although I suppouse a all out 3 or 4 player bash would work) make 
their way to lv 1. Now player freindly is turned off and, when both 
people are ready, they punch each others lights out!!
      I realise this  puts mages and rouges at a disadvantage, but I 
had a mage almost beat me and he was the same level as I. Dupers will 
agree to this and all the ones I havep layed gave me great feedback. 
I chalaged some dupers to this and, out of 6, 5 accepted. Out of the 
ones who accepted three were beaten (one got under ten the other 
resigned and the third fell to my fists [had to give back ear 
though]). One timeouted before he could get there and one beat me(I 
carry my own ear in my backpack now).
       Please try this and give me feedback or just tell me what u 
think.
       Yours most barabaricly  

                    Conan the Barbarian &#34;there can be only 
one&#34; Highlander (apologies go to the guy I stole this off, it 
just sounds sooo cool)</pre>
