&#62; &#62; Your desperate act against me are very entertaining.
&#62; &#62; You guys should be on the movie.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I'm sorry but, you guys lose.  
&#62; &#62; I could not find any legit players today morning.  I joined 15 games 
&#62; &#62; today, yet I found not a single legit ones.  Ofcourse, if I compare 
&#62; &#62; the 5000 players I might be wrong, or bad luck. 
&#62; &#62; But I met over 40 people, yet they were all duped cheaters.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I think not many people want to be a legit.  I only see fairly few 
&#62; &#62; legits around in ogdens too.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; From my last post, I expected some good counterattack on my 
&#62; &#62; beliefs...Yet, only Tal' gave me some reasonable thoughts, others 
&#62; &#62; were garbage.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I think I can only argue with Tal' for my beliefs.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; (only tal has right to answer my writings...you may allowed to read)
&#62; &#62; To Tal':  
&#62; &#62; Why I protect-CHEATERs, even though I'm legit?  I will give the 
&#62; &#62; answer, Cheaters act clean and do not PK.  Ofcourse, I cannot 
&#62; &#62; represent all of the cheaters in B.net, BUT most cheaters just use 
&#62; &#62; duped stuff.  Very few cheaters uses god-mode or trainers.  I only 
&#62; &#62; met 5 pkillers out of 40 cheaters today.  
&#62; &#62;
&#62; 
&#62; Well, I'm level 39, and I ran into about 6 players today.  2 were 
&#62; actually LEGIT, the other 3 had 2000 HP (one claimed not to be a 
&#62; cheater).  I believe the higher you get in level, the more and more 
&#62; hardcore cheaters you encounter.  Usually I don't even meet ONE legit 
&#62; player...I guess I got lucky today.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Ofcourse, you can't stop cheat.  I do not recommand cheat for others, 
&#62; &#62; but I do not stop them from cheating either.  If you get the point, 
&#62; &#62; we can't to anyting about cheat.  That is my plot.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;  --YOU CAN'T DO A THING--
&#62; 
&#62; I may not be able to do anything, but I have a helluva lot of fun 
&#62; trying.
&#62; It may be a lost cause, but its better than just accepting my fate.  
&#62; I never have been one to &#34;follow the norm&#34;, and this case is 
&#62; no different.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; My major plot is that &#34;CHEAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED&#34;, even 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard told us that.  Some people dislike cheat, but that doesn't 
&#62; &#62; mean other shouldn't.  People have choice to cheat.  Yet you people 
&#62; &#62; are saying &#34;CHEATERS ARE CORRUPTING THE B.nET!&#34;, I agree.  
&#62; &#62; But if you can't go along with the flow of fashion, you are only one 
&#62; &#62; who would be left alone.  
&#62; 
&#62; Perhaps it is &#34;accepted&#34;, but is it right?  Many things in 
&#62; society are accepted, but aren't morally right.  Just because the 
&#62; majority believes one thing does not mean its &#34;right&#34;, it 
&#62; just means alot of people have been misled.  People have the 
&#62; &#34;choice&#34; wether or not to do drugs or kill someone, but does 
&#62; that mean its right?
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; See, PEOPLE HAVE CHOICE.  You can't make THEM to do things that you 
&#62; &#62; want them to.  Now, YOU LOSE.  
&#62; 
&#62; I don't make them.  I convince them.  If I don't kill them, I simply 
&#62; show them a legit character can beat a cheater.
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; Many people chose their way to become a cheater, they love cheat.  
&#62; &#62; They love what they are doing.  Let them be what they want to be.  
&#62; &#62; But what you are saying is that WE &#34;MUST&#34; end the cheat, vert 
&#62; &#62; few accepted your words.  I'm neutral, I'm just defending the RIGHT 
&#62; &#62; of the cheaters.  
&#62; 
&#62; Many people chose to and love to kill people (NOT that I'm saying 
&#62; cheating on B.net is anywhere NEAR as bad as killing someone in read 
&#62; life), but does that make it right?  Nope.  Their way of playing 
&#62; interferes with the way others play, so it simply shouldn't be 
&#62; alowed.  Personally, I don't consider cheaters players, since they 
&#62; aren't &#34;playing&#34;, they're cheating.  If someone game into a 
&#62; baseball game with a pistol, would they be &#34;playing&#34;?
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; If you don't like the public games, then join some sort of guild.  
&#62; &#62; Don't tell CHEATERS what to do, they are not your slaves.  
&#62; 
&#62; I don't tell.  I ask. 
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; B.net was ment to be a place where people gather around and have fun 
&#62; &#62; and become friends (or just a marketing plot from Blizzard).  I do 
&#62; &#62; agree with PKilling, fine with me, since most of my friends were 
&#62; &#62; Pkillers anyway.  Some people think that if you get killed by a 
&#62; &#62; cheater, you become a loser.  No, I got kill alot by cheaters, yet I 
&#62; &#62; don't complain.  Maybe your view of CHEATER-PK and my view of CHEATER-
&#62; &#62; PK are different.  Result is the same &#34;YOU DIE&#34;.  
&#62; 
&#62; Cheating PK= someone who kills someone while cheating.  Any other 
&#62; definitions?
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; What's the difference??  You die anyway~~
&#62; &#62; You might say, &#34;CHEATERS HAS GREAT ADVANTAGE!!&#34;, I agree.  
&#62; &#62; But only thing you lose will be your 10 gold pieces worth ear. 
&#62; &#62; (+ half of your gold) 
&#62; 
&#62; Luckily, most cheaters are too stupid to MK other players, but I have 
&#62; nearly been MKed by an autokiller, and believe me, it was NOT fun.
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; See, cheating or no cheating ends the same.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Many people who complain about cheating are Player-Killers.  But 
&#62; &#62; don't you remember the days when you pkilled more than 100 players 
&#62; &#62; per day??  Just think today as your pay back.  Ofcourse, you pkilled 
&#62; &#62; people with your incredible backstabbing skills, now those people 
&#62; &#62; whom you killed are coming back with their god-mode to end your 
&#62; &#62; laughs.  You might say &#34;but I killed him LEGITly, not 
&#62; &#62; cheating&#34;.  Well, you killed themm right?  And the guy got killed 
&#62; &#62; want to revenge, right?  It doesn't matter to them what they use, as 
&#62; &#62; long as you die just like they did. 
&#62; 
&#62; I wouldn't know.  I didn't PK until cheating was around.  In fact, I 
&#62; was anti-PK until I realized it was part of the game.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; You killed innocent people.  Now those innocent people are cheating 
&#62; &#62; to get their revenge.  Those CHEATER-PK are using same things as you 
&#62; &#62; legit-PK did, &#34;KILL FOR NO REASONS&#34;.  So if you get killed by 
&#62; &#62; CHEATER with no reasons, don't complain to cheaters, complain to 
&#62; &#62; LEGIT-PKs.  
&#62; &#62; I don't, WHY SHOULD YOU??! 
&#62; &#62; (From: Anti-CHEATING.  &#34;WHY DO YOU CHEAT, I DON'T&#34;)
&#62;  
&#62; My main complaint is that they are cheating to avoid something that 
&#62; was LEGITAMETLY part of the game.  Many cheaters are just babies 
&#62; afraid to get killed by the big bad PKers.  Cheating to get revenge 
&#62; doesn't make it right.  If someone cheats because they got killed it 
&#62; is NOT the killer's fault.  They are human and can make their own 
&#62; choices.  They should be able to tell what is right and wrong.
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; Get some decent COUNTERATTACKS PEOPLE...
&#62; &#62; I'm waiting.....
&#62; 
&#62; Was that good enough?
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; S-R.  
&#62; &#62; If you have insulted me before, do not even repost, I won't read it,  
&#62; &#62; nor anyone else, cause its all same thing &#34;TALON, YOU SUCK&#34;.
