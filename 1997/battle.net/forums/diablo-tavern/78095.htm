&#62; Lately, with EVERYONE wanting Strange Swords of Haste and Gold Rings 
&#62; of Perfection, it seems the topic is now Accuracy Vs. Damage.  Well, 
&#62; let us debate.
&#62; 
&#62; As Eugene and several others said, if you can't hit, you can't 
&#62; damage. Yet, if you had a Strange Sword of Haste, say 6-15 Bastard 
&#62; Sword Style, and you can now hit the enemy all you want!!  Problem 
&#62; is, being a mage or a rogue, you may only do about 30 damage per hit, 
&#62; not fun.  Even as a warrior, you can maybe only do about 60-70 
&#62; damage, but all of the shots hit :)
&#62; 
&#62; Now, say you have the Merciless sword of Slaughter, 6-15 Bastard 
&#62; Sword, +20 points of damage to damage, plus 114&#37; damage.  Wow, it 
&#62; kicks, it breaks an enemy in two...but, what if you can't even HIT 
&#62; the damn target?  You can now clean up on damage, yet you maybe hit 1 
&#62; time out of 7.
&#62; 
&#62; So, which is more important?
&#62; 
&#62; Simple:  Both need to exist in harmony.  So, what weapon do you need?
&#62; 
&#62; King's Swords ARE that medium, but we all know that 98&#37; of all 
&#62; King's Swords are dupes.  And, we have not even talked about other 
&#62; weapons, like Staves, Bows, etc...so, let us.
&#62; 
&#62; Rogues have no problem with being accurate. They have the Dexerity to 
&#62; back it up, so they are covered.  When it comes to damage, they just 
&#62; need a good bow. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Mages have their spells, but when they need to exchange regular 
&#62; wacks, Dreamflanges are their cup of tea.
&#62; 
&#62; So, Warriors?  What do WE use?
&#62; 
&#62; Okay, Axes are fun when they hit the enemy, and clubs and maces and 
&#62; morning stars are fun for bashing the undead and little enemies.  
&#62; But, we also need to worry about Hammers and Mauls.  It goes on and 
&#62; on.
&#62; 
&#62; The point is, there is ONE weapon that is VERY avaible, easily found, 
&#62; and one of the most accurate and damaging weapons, and even level 4 
&#62; people can find one and start player killing.
&#62; 
&#62; The weapon?  The Grandfather.
&#62; 
&#62; 10-20 base damage, plus 70&#37; damage, plus 20&#37; hit, plus 20 HP, 
&#62; plus 5 all, one handed.  You can now have a good damage, accurate 
&#62; weapon and still keep your shield.  Also, it is accurate with that 
&#62; 20&#37; hit increase the bonuses are overall well.
&#62; 
&#62; So, what is more important to you, hit &#37; or damage &#37;?  Over 
&#62; all, I think the thing you need it a balance of both.
&#62;

Accuracy is more important..trust me on this</pre>
