<pre>So, after my devastating loss, I spent a couple of days being 
showered with gifts from clan members
and people I had never met. After all of this great help, I decided 
to try my hand in my old
favorite haunt, Nightmare Hell.  Level 13 caused little difficulty, 
as did level 14.  I gladly 
strolled on down to Laz’s lair where I first had to get through 
Bloodlust and her minions…
(this is where I should mention that a good helm was the item that I 
was afraid would take
months to locate)…
So, after a bit of a struggle, the way to Laz was clear except for 
Bloodlust. Since I wasn’t in
the mood to fool around, I decided to Stone Curse her, and lay into 
her with my newly
acquired Eaglehorn , (thanks Pet, and Crys for the great job of 
running a clan armory)..
when &#34;clunk&#34;…..  unique crown falls to the ground! 
Now, I have only held other people’s Royal Circulet’s while they 
transfered, but I knew it was 
a unique crown, so needless to say my heart jumped into my throat 
when I saw what had befallen.
This wonderful find cheered me up quite a bit, so that day at work, I 
thought about a song parody
I could do and this is what I came up with.

To the tune of &#34;Bye, Bye, Love&#34;…..

There goes my god-ly
helm of mammoth *ack*
And my precious amulet,
sapphire zodiac.
They were my babies,
‘tis all my fault
Goodbye ring of zod,
+20 cobalt.

Bye, Bye Saint-
-ly helm of Precision,
Hell! Oh, bad decision
I think I’m a-gonna die,
Bye, bye equipment, Bye bye

I’m through with solo,
IPX hell/hell,
My fireball barely singed them,
tho it’s a 15th level spell.
My chain just tickled,
Arrows like bites from a flea,
My stone curse can handle 4 of them,
but not 23.

Bye, bye Merc-
-iless Bow of the Heavens.
Hell! Oh, my hit was 311,
I think I’m a-gonna die,
Bye, bye equipment Bye, bye

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That’s all fer now friends.  I was going to tell the whole story of 
how I lost all my equipment,
but suffice it to say, this is the third time a glitch has wiped my 
characters clean. 
First time a systems error did it..
Second time, as I returned down thru my port, I ended up NOT where I 
left it…
Third time (this one), a teleport that sent me half way across the 
level..

*shrug*

I hope U enjoyed my ditty…
&#60;Madelyn&#62;
-not so much Sad Mad anymore  J

P.s  Many thanks again to those who helped me regain my composure….</pre>
