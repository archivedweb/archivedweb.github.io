&#62; i was only voicing my concern over these events..and my anger over 
&#62; seeing the items that some of my other clan members have.
&#62; 
&#62; i do not think one can find a godly helm of whale at level 39 in 
&#62; nightmare hell, or even on sale for that matter.i dont believe one 
&#62; can be so lucky as find ob zod rings (if anyone even HAS them..ive 
&#62; never seena  REAL one..must be a sight to behold!)
&#62; 
&#62; i KNOW snakegod doesnt cheat, but when you have 90 plus members, i 
&#62; mean, somewhere, there has to be a little slip up ..even if they dont 
&#62; realize they have duped items.ill admit, that before i joined 
&#62; snakegod, i had a duped royal circlet and ob amu of zod..but i dumped 
&#62; them (much to my disgrace) and obtained suitable replacements.
&#62; 
&#62; i just want to let the clan know that the post was only meant as an 
&#62; open question....the question being: are you sure you dont cheat?
&#62; 
&#62; i KNOW none of us use hack programs or editors,or what have you, but 
&#62; its very easy to pick an item up froma  friend who claims it to be 
&#62; real, and since you trust your friend, you keep it, not even thinking 
&#62; for a second that the kings sword of blood he gave you was 
&#62; duped....how come i NEVER found these items? i used to spend a little 
&#62; over an hour each day creating serial modem games and checking gris 
&#62; and wirt in hopes of finding half the stuff everyone else in my clan 
&#62; has.when i heard blackwind and gilgamesh bragging about their awesome 
&#62; weaponry one day last week, that was it, it made me sick to my 
&#62; stomach.i guess i really do suck..has anyone at all found the 
&#62; following, and if so, tell me how and where you found them:
&#62; 
&#62; any ob of zod jewelry
&#62; any godly plate
&#62; godly helm of whale
&#62; KSOH,KSOB,KSOV,KSOS
&#62; 
&#62; i've never seen themm....is it possible?
&#62; 

I have never found any ob of zod, godly helm of whale....

I once get a godly mail of the whale from Wirt for about 97,000 golds
forget the stat... 

I bought King Sword's of Haste, King Sword's of Blood and King 
Sword's of Gore from Gris.... cost between 84,000 to 97,000 golds

Here is what my char have.....

Royal Circlet
Dragon Amulet of the Tiger
Obs ring of Wolf
Obs ring of Harmony
Saintly Plate of the Stars
Saintly Shield of the Tiger
King Sword's of Haste


Inventory
