<pre>notice that before i posted to defend you, yesterday,
people were signing the petition like crazy, afterwards,
only about 10 people replied to it, and half were against
the banning.  i personally put a stop to this damn witchhunt,
and i better be getting my lawyer's fee in the mail soon.
mail it to :

hehe

well, i still don't think you did it.  why would talon
post this crap, deny it, apologized, and then deny it 
again?  it just doesn't make sense.  

i think that a third party was involved.  i think that this is 
what really happened:

1.  some lamer, neither theman nor talon, decided
to play a stupid little joke make theman look bad,
and posted the offending post.

2.  theman let's his hatred for talon cloud his judgement,
and without thinking, blames talon.

3.  everyone let's their hatred for talon cloud their judgement,
and almost everyone blames talon, even though they
saw absolutely no evidence.  everyone simply said, &#34;me
too, don't leave me out!&#34;

4.  the imposter, still trying to cause trouble, posted
as talon, and blamed theman.

5.  theman, denies it, and blames the real talon, again.

6.  the petition get's started, everyone  (except a few
people) get tricked, and signs it. 

7.  the imposter, knowing he can no longer trick anyone 
get people to think theman did it, gets another idea-- go 
along with this and get talon in trouble.  how did he
play along?  he posted as talon this time, and
apologized, knowing no one would accept the apology.
this way, it would seem like talon admitted it, without
flat-out giving away the imposter's secret.

8.  theman says that since talon said sorry, he must have
done it.  this was the imposter's intention when he did
#7.

9.  talon returns home, sees all this and denies that it was
him. 

this was my best theory, given all the evidence.  think about
it, the writing style of the imposter is nothing like
that of talon.  if you want an example, look at some of
my posts from yesterday, i think there is ample evidence there.
theman did NOT do this to frame talon.  he could not
have posted 3 times in two hours.  in conclusion,
if it was neither of them, it there had to be a third party.

well, that was my conspiracy theory, tell me what you think.
the only way i might have missed is if theman has two
isp's, in which case, he COULD have framed talon.
