<pre>I also remember the so-called &#34;Good Old Days&#34;.  I don't 
really wish for them to return, specifically, because I never really 
played in public games.  I think my last public game was in mid 
February.  I would meet people in chat, get to know them over a 
couple of days, and then go play with them.  My judgement was wrong 
only once, and I ended up with a pkiller in the game with me.  He was 
a non-cheat, though, so all he got was one swing at me before I quit 
the game.

As all things do, Diablo begins to grow old once you've beaten it 
with all three classes on Hell/Hell.  But I keep playing.  I'll just 
chat for a few days and not play, but then the urge to cut loose with 
Chain Lightning just overwhelms me (apologies to all warriors and 
rogues whom I have (mis)used in the fine art of Cooking According to 
Ridcully).

I've also had Command and Conquer: Red Alert for months, about as 
long as Diablo, and it grows old at times too.  But since I don't 
cheat at either one, the excitement of play is still there.  For me, 
it all boils down to the people you play with, not so much the game 
you play.  Heck, I still play Monopoly, Life, Chess, and Checkers at 
times.  Goodness knows how many individual games of those four I have 
played during the course of my lifetime, and I still go back to them 
occasionally.

In short, while I think that cheaters have ruined Battle.net for 
themselves, I find that it is alive and well for most of the rest of 
us.  Newbies are still joining/forming clans, non-cheaters still play 
in the public games for pkillers to prey on, and all that is really 
different is the people doing the playing and killing.  Many now use 
cheats.  Many of the old-time players have left Diablo.  But while it 
may not be a joy to any of us old-timers to find that suit of magical 
Chain Mail of the Lion, we can play with new players for whom the 
experience is still fresh and be rejuvenated by their excitement.  

Try this:  create a new character, along with some guild buddies (or 
friends if you are not in a guild).  Do some adventuring with just 
the new character for a while.  Refuse to play with your old one for 
about a week or so.  I did recently with a new warrior character, and 
that was fun!  It's been ages since I went around swinging a blade 
for a living instead of throwing magic hither and yon and then 
running like crazy when the horde of &#60;fill in the blank&#62; was 
stirred up by my show of mana.  And now I get to be on the receiving 
end of the stray fireballs.  Diablo is not new to me anymore, but I 
still find it loads of fun, akin to reading a great book again.  You 
still know how it ends, but it grabs your attention and keeps you 
enthralled just the same.

Anyway, sorry in turn for the rambling on my part.  Just a differing 
perspective from ol' Arlaquin here.
