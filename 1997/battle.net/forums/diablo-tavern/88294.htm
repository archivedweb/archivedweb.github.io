<pre>First, this stuff is not exactly accurate because I was not on till 
late February. 

It was the week before Diablos release. Everyone was excited about co-
oping on b-net. Except for a few special individuals. They were out 
for blood. They united and formed the great INFERNO. Peglegboy, lead 
this great federation. 

About 2 weeks later. Diablo had been out. The pk rumors were 
spreading like wildfire. Inferno was known as the deadliest guild 
ever. 

About 2 more weeks later. Enigma had created his trainers. Everyone 
knew these would be the death of Diablo. Inferno was plagued with 
cheaters. Peglegboy was against the idea. He wanted to destroy 
cheaters, instead of be a cheater. And that he did. 

Sometime around late Februaury. The rumors of UO were spreading. 
Inferno decided to move on. They spent much time planning on thing 
like divisions and TOs until they were perfectly organized. Then, 
disaster struck. Peg was missing. 

Early June. Peglegboy, had returned. Inferno was a large growing 
horde, of bloodthirsty ogres. With over 700 members resistance was 
truely futile. 

Early July. Peglegboy and his council of 3 decided to drop the 
divisions idea. At the same time Tracy and Fist [who just quit] were 
sending email to others who might wanna join their guild PoC [priests 
of chaos]. It was an invitation only guild of elite, respected pks. 
They wanted to keep small and be like the old inferno. This probably, 
was the death of Inferno. Mayhem used the same idea. 

Mid July. Many active members have quit. New inferno was formed to 
revive inferno, but it was an attempt that failed miserably.


I think we should remember the great INFERNO, for what it was. It was 
probably the best [online] guild ever. Let us not forget them.

1 of a million legit pks on b-net. No, wait. Their are only about a 
1,000. No, more like 100. No, somewhere around 50. 1 of about 50 
legit pks left on b-net.

&#34; Destruction is the only purification? What have you been 
smokin? &#34;</pre>
