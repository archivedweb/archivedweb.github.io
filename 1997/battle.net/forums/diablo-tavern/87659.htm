&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; If you want to participate in this survey, please answer the 
&#62; questions *BEFORE* you read other peoples replies (in order to 
&#62; preserve answers). I want each of your opinions.
&#62;  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; This is a simple survey of what people consider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; is or is not, cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player? 
 no.  most peole don't dupe gold.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?  
no, unless it is duped stuff.  taking  stuff from high levelers is 
a part of the game.   it is kinda cheap, but as long as you know 
it isn't duped, i think it's not cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
no, this is a built-in part of the game.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?
no, but this is still kinda cheap.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
no.  if you are playing with low levelers, you are pretty
much gonna clear it anyways.  

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?
nope, it's a part of the game.  people do it all the time.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
yes.  it is not part of the game, and if helps you make descisions
that you would not otherwise be able to make.  it helps you
decide whether to duel him, and how to duel him.  this gives
you an unfair advantage, since the other guy doesn't have this
info on you in return.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?
no.  it just isn't.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?
nope.  if you found the items legitly, then you have the right to
keep them.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
no, but it is cheap.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
hahahaha.  no

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
no.  

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
yes. 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
yes.  blizzard programed your diablo to crash your system
for a reason.  crashing is part of the game.  (just kidding)
 
&#62; &#60;---!begin more questions---&#62;
&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change character names?
yes.  bounty hunting is a part of the game, and to restrict that
is to change the nature of the game in the favor of the hunted.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Mkill someone?
nope, it is just plain smart.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Change accts on battle.net
yes.  same reason as two questions up.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Transfer characters to another computer?
no, as long as you erase the one in your first computer.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Run Diablo off your hard drive?
why would it be?

&#62; #). Is it cheating to Use utilities that allow things such as Ghost 
&#62; See?
no.  this program restores the original game.  it doesn't change
the original game at all.

&#62; #). Is it cheating to use other chat utilities such as Diapolis? 
&#62; (ask a snakegod member what it is)
huh?

&#62; #). Is it cheating to transfer single player characters to 
&#62; multiplayer?
yes, this was not meant to be done, and gives you a chance
to do something no one else can do.
