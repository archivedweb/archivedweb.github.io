<pre> Your entire argument consists of nothing but ignorant 
generalizations with no facts attached to them whatsoever. Your 
attempt at making yourself look and sound intelligent also failed 
miserably. If you haven't noticed, every post you write gets flamed 
and ridiculed. Not because people don't like you, but because you 
make completely illogical arguments without facts to support them. 
You also contradict yourself on a constand basis. If you are writing 
these posts to gain attention, then you are succeeding. However, if 
you're trying to prove some sort of point, then you are failing. In 
each post you write, you make a bigger ass out of yourself. Take my 
advice and just shut up.

BTW-This same idiot asked to join the PoC a couple of days ago. Now 
he flames us. I am now convinced that SR is doing this mainly to gain 
attention. Below is a link to his post.

&#62; Your desperate act against me are very entertaining.
&#62; You guys should be on the movie.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm sorry but, you guys lose.  
&#62; I could not find any legit players today morning.  I joined 15 games 
&#62; today, yet I found not a single legit ones.  Ofcourse, if I compare 
&#62; the 5000 players I might be wrong, or bad luck. 
&#62; But I met over 40 people, yet they were all duped cheaters.  
&#62; 
&#62; I think not many people want to be a legit.  I only see fairly few 
&#62; legits around in ogdens too.  
&#62; 
&#62; From my last post, I expected some good counterattack on my 
&#62; beliefs...Yet, only Tal' gave me some reasonable thoughts, others 
&#62; were garbage.  
&#62; 
&#62; I think I can only argue with Tal' for my beliefs.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; (only tal has right to answer my writings...you may allowed to read)
&#62; To Tal':  
&#62; Why I protect-CHEATERs, even though I'm legit?  I will give the 
&#62; answer, Cheaters act clean and do not PK.  Ofcourse, I cannot 
&#62; represent all of the cheaters in B.net, BUT most cheaters just use 
&#62; duped stuff.  Very few cheaters uses god-mode or trainers.  I only 
&#62; met 5 pkillers out of 40 cheaters today.  
&#62; 
&#62; Ofcourse, you can't stop cheat.  I do not recommand cheat for others, 
&#62; but I do not stop them from cheating either.  If you get the point, 
&#62; we can't to anyting about cheat.  That is my plot.  
&#62; 
&#62;  --YOU CAN'T DO A THING--
&#62; 
&#62; My major plot is that &#34;CHEAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED&#34;, even 
&#62; Blizzard told us that.  Some people dislike cheat, but that doesn't 
&#62; mean other shouldn't.  People have choice to cheat.  Yet you people 
&#62; are saying &#34;CHEATERS ARE CORRUPTING THE B.nET!&#34;, I agree.  
&#62; But if you can't go along with the flow of fashion, you are only one 
&#62; who would be left alone.  
&#62; 
&#62; See, PEOPLE HAVE CHOICE.  You can't make THEM to do things that you 
&#62; want them to.  Now, YOU LOSE.  
&#62; 
&#62; Many people chose their way to become a cheater, they love cheat.  
&#62; They love what they are doing.  Let them be what they want to be.  
&#62; But what you are saying is that WE &#34;MUST&#34; end the cheat, vert 
&#62; few accepted your words.  I'm neutral, I'm just defending the RIGHT 
&#62; of the cheaters.  
&#62; 
&#62; If you don't like the public games, then join some sort of guild.  
&#62; Don't tell CHEATERS what to do, they are not your slaves.  
&#62; 
&#62; B.net was ment to be a place where people gather around and have fun 
&#62; and become friends (or just a marketing plot from Blizzard).  I do 
&#62; agree with PKilling, fine with me, since most of my friends were 
&#62; Pkillers anyway.  Some people think that if you get killed by a 
&#62; cheater, you become a loser.  No, I got kill alot by cheaters, yet I 
&#62; don't complain.  Maybe your view of CHEATER-PK and my view of CHEATER-
&#62; PK are different.  Result is the same &#34;YOU DIE&#34;.  
&#62; 
&#62; What's the difference??  You die anyway~~
&#62; You might say, &#34;CHEATERS HAS GREAT ADVANTAGE!!&#34;, I agree.  
&#62; But only thing you lose will be your 10 gold pieces worth ear. 
&#62; (+ half of your gold) 
&#62; 
&#62; See, cheating or no cheating ends the same.  
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Many people who complain about cheating are Player-Killers.  But 
&#62; don't you remember the days when you pkilled more than 100 players 
&#62; per day??  Just think today as your pay back.  Ofcourse, you pkilled 
&#62; people with your incredible backstabbing skills, now those people 
&#62; whom you killed are coming back with their god-mode to end your 
&#62; laughs.  You might say &#34;but I killed him LEGITly, not 
&#62; cheating&#34;.  Well, you killed themm right?  And the guy got killed 
&#62; want to revenge, right?  It doesn't matter to them what they use, as 
&#62; long as you die just like they did. 
&#62; 
&#62; You killed innocent people.  Now those innocent people are cheating 
&#62; to get their revenge.  Those CHEATER-PK are using same things as you 
&#62; legit-PK did, &#34;KILL FOR NO REASONS&#34;.  So if you get killed by 
&#62; CHEATER with no reasons, don't complain to cheaters, complain to 
&#62; LEGIT-PKs.  
&#62; I don't, WHY SHOULD YOU??! 
&#62; (From: Anti-CHEATING.  &#34;WHY DO YOU CHEAT, I DON'T&#34;)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Get some decent COUNTERATTACKS PEOPLE...
&#62; I'm waiting.....
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; S-R.  
&#62; If you have insulted me before, do not even repost, I won't read it,  
&#62; nor anyone else, cause its all same thing &#34;TALON, YOU SUCK&#34;.</pre>
