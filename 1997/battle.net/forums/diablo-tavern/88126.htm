<pre>About two weeks ago, I logged into a game that said no pks.  Of 
coarse, there were two pks inside, but I was stupid back then.  And 
lucky as hell.  Their names were mordred and warlord.  There are many 
people with these names.  They know who they are.  We agreed to go to 
the dungeon, and I was the first one down.  I went west, into a 
library and closed the door behind me.  There were two doors on each 
side of the room.  I got a scroll of identify and a scroll of 
healing.  Just as I clicked on the bookcase above me, the doors 
opened.  Fireballs came in from each side.  Then, I heard them both 
scream.  They killed each other.  They both said,&#34;SHIT!  I 
thought you were him!  Sorry.  Hey arch, please res us!&#34;  So I 
took their gold and their ears and left the game.  I was laughing in 
my sleep that night.

&#62; Ok this is the list of hularious duesl iv'e had. Feel free to add on 
&#62; to it :)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Duel #1---&#62; Just when I got onto Bnet. There was a rogue named 
&#62; XxX. We decided to duel. I was legit level 24 and she was cheater 
&#62; level 25. She asked me what spell to use and I didn't know at the 
&#62; time. I walked after and killed her 5 times. After the fifth time she 
&#62; asks me : Why isn't this spell working? I say what spell, she says 
&#62; StoneCurse hehehe
&#62; At the time i didn't know it couldn't be done to players. So after 
&#62; she boosted it up to level 255 stone curse, she still couldn't kill 
&#62; me. So we resorted to me standing by the animals and she stonecursing 
&#62; them to see if it would do both of us :) The times i miss!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Duel #2---&#62; After me getting on to Bnet I had never even known 
&#62; about hacks! This was about 3 weeks after i got into Bnet. This game 
&#62; had all legit people except one person....that we didn't know had 
&#62; cheats. He said he had on like a diablo plate and other hacks like 
&#62; that. His HP was around 1000 something. He was a nice cheater 
&#62; though..... He killed everything in nm/hell for us so we could get 
&#62; our second dot. While he was battling Diablo i came up with the great 
&#62; idea to heal him while he was attacking Diablo. He dropped dead!!! 
&#62; Later he wanted to duel me....but i knew how to kill him. He just 
&#62; couldnt figure out that i was doing heal other at the same time he 
&#62; was dropping dead! I miss those days.....</pre>
