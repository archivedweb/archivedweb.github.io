<pre>Hello? Have we angered a man with such low self esteme that the 
finger goes pointing towards our direction, claiming errors of the 
righteous ways, in which you whould probably have no idea of 
conceiving? Have you been deprived of such love that you throw your 
anger foolishly at this guild? You have no idea what we are, do you? 
Had you a single brain cell that functions properly you would not 
have directed such insults to the ENTIRE guild then leave an address 
of which where we can find you and beat you down like old yeller. Had 
you been smart, you would have told ME personally, face to face, 
without emberacing yourself in such a manor, considering I was the 
one that structured this guild from the very beginning (which makes 
it older than your train of thought). Now, if your guild had the mass 
amounts of leadership that you claim, then I suspect they would 
(1)send a more suitable message for recuitment and (2)never let a 
half wit, such as yourself, into the guild to begin with. Now, if it 
is you that is the leader, then, well, it would be a surprise what 
lackey members that tagged along to your side like some dead fly to a 
sticker. If, I were you, I'd stop daydreaming and get a life. Go 
critize some other guild because it's obvious that you have no 
fricken idea what your talking about.

&#62; Nobody here should join the guild Tarot.  They are a bunch of idiots 
&#62; in a guild with no organization or direction.  No solid leadership, 
&#62; either.  They only recruit members so they can kick you out and 
&#62; harass you.  Don't join...it's not a good guild.  For a good guild, 
&#62; join either Guild of the New Dawn or the Alliance of Divine Harmony.  
&#62; Those are some REAL guilds with strong leadership.
