&#62; 
&#62; Laz Run, Behind the Scenes
&#62; 
&#62; 	&#34;Oh damn, not again!! We just finished a set! Don't these clowns 
&#62; ever get tired?&#34; sighed Blackjade as she moved off  toward her 
&#62; dressing area. &#34;I haven't even had time to eat my lunch yet!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Stop complaining and get dressed! These are all Level 35 and 
&#62; above characters so they shouldn't take to long to get here. I 
&#62; recognize a couple of them. They usually just come directly down if 
&#62; they can find the stairs.&#34; Lazarus spoke from experience.
&#62; 	Just then Bloodlust walked in carrying a milkshake in one hand and a 
&#62; cheeseburger in the other. A slight drip of catsup trickled down from 
&#62; her lips. Her hair was up in curlers and her robe was slightly 
&#62; disheveled. &#34;Couldn't I just not be there, they usually don't 
&#62; find me anyway. All they want is to find your room Laz and then 
&#62; leave. Jeez, they could just create Level 15 and skip all of the 
&#62; others, most of them would be just as happy!!&#34; She proceeded to 
&#62; take a big bite from her burger and slouched into a chair by the door.
&#62; 	&#34;Lusty, they quite often hunt you down. You're almost as popular 
&#62; as Jade and Red Vex!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;That Vex can be such a slu....&#34;  her sentence was cut short 
&#62; by Red Vex sauntering into the room from her dressing room.
&#62; 	&#34;Hi guys. I hear we have another run starting. Well I just can't 
&#62; do it. I just put my g-string in the dryer and I didn't bring my 
&#62; extra one with me today.&#34; Red Vex said flatly.
&#62; 	&#34;Vex, you have to go on. We can't do the gig without you. How 
&#62; would that look?&#34; Lazarus was trying to make his point.
&#62; 	&#34;Well, exactly how do you expect me to do it, in my robe?&#34; 
&#62; came the sharp retort from Red Vex.
&#62; 	&#34;Can't you borrow one from one of the other girls, just for this 
&#62;  show?&#34; Laz asked trying to settle the overwrought witch down. 
&#62; &#34;Surely one of the others has a spare they can loan you&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I'm not wearing a g-string from any of them&#34; Vex stated. 
&#62; &#34;They are all a bunch of cows&#34; she thought to herself.
&#62; 	Lazarus threw his hands in the air and headed for his dressing room. 
&#62; &#34;Working with this bunch is enough to kill a guy!!&#34; he 
&#62; thought.
&#62; 	The monitor at the head of the large room was now filling with the 
&#62; names of all of the cast and where their beginning marks would be. 
&#62; The sign flashed &#34;3 Minutes until show time&#34;.
&#62; 	&#34;That's our cue gang, let's hit it!&#34; shouted Lazarus as he 
&#62; exited his dressing room, fully clad in his ornate robes and carrying 
&#62; the large carved staff of the Archbishop. He could see all of the 
&#62; extras moving down the hall outside the bosses room. &#34;Quite a big 
&#62; crowd, maybe it will take a while to get to us&#34; he mused.
&#62; 	&#34;I'm not going on!&#34; Red Vex was very adamant about it. 
&#62; &#34;I refuse to the do the show naked and no one else has my 
&#62; figure.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I beg you pardon, Vexie!&#34; the response came from Bloodlust, 
&#62; &#34;I have every bit as good a figure as you, maybe even better!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Dream on Lust. They chase me all over the dungeon, bet they 
&#62; don't do that to you!&#34; Red Vex taunted.
&#62; 	&#34;Yes they do!!&#34;
&#62; 	The two locked stares in the middle of the room, neither backing 
&#62; down.
&#62; 	A claxon sounded signaling that they only had one minute to take 
&#62; their places.
&#62; 	&#34;Move it girls!&#34; shouted Lazarus as he headed out the door 
&#62; into the hall that led to the Level 15 elevator. He could still hear 
&#62; the two witches arguing as he reached the elevator doors.
&#62; 	There beside the doors as always was a large box containing weapons, 
&#62; books, armor, rings, amulet, anything one of the adventuring fools 
&#62; might want. Most of the time they were provided with trashy stuff to 
&#62; carry on the gig, but occasionally management would actually drop 
&#62; something nice in the box.
&#62; 	&#34;Not very often&#34; mumbled Lazarus as he reached into the box 
&#62; and pulled out an old weathered book. &#34;This will teach them to 
&#62; come down so often!!&#34; there was a  gleam in his eyes as he said 
&#62; that.
&#62; 	He looked back down the hall and saw the three witch bosses coming 
&#62; toward him, all three shouting at the same time, none listening to 
&#62; the others. He couldn't make out what Red Vex  was wearing, but 
&#62; Bloodlust still had the milkshake and burger in her hands.
&#62; 	&#34;Lose the food, Lusty. You know there is no food allowed in the 
&#62; dungeon. It's a safety violation. I've heard of adventurers slipping 
&#62; on wrappers and filing suit against Diablo over it. I still think the 
&#62; wrapper was dropped by another gamer. I've seen at least one bringing 
&#62; Twinkies into the dungeon!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I have to finish my lunch.&#34; said Bloodlust, &#34;Anyway 
&#62; they won't find me for a few minutes. I'll put the trash in a barrel. 
&#62; No one will find it there. Laz, baby, could you just slip a little 
&#62; old ring into my sash here and don't get fresh!!!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I have to find another job, that's all there is to it!&#34; Laz 
&#62; thought as he picked a ring from the box and slipped it carefully 
&#62; into Bloodlust's belt.
&#62; 	Red Vex reached for a bastard sword from the box at the same instant 
&#62; as Blackjade.
&#62; 	&#34;I got it first!&#34; sneered Blackjade.
&#62; 	&#34;No, I did!&#34; shouted Red Vex back at her.
&#62; 	The claxon sounded again signifying that the adventurers had enter 
&#62; Level 13.
&#62; 	&#34;We have to be getting in place , Now!&#34; he shouted the word 
&#62; now', trying to stop the two witches from arguing and get them in 
&#62; place. The way things were going he might kill the witches himself 
&#62; before the gamers arrived. &#34;You two stop fighting over that 
&#62; stupid sword. Vex take something else and let's move!&#34;
&#62; 	Red Vex shot first Blackjade and then Lazarus a filthy glance and 
&#62; grabbed a robe from the box. &#34;This is a real piece of trash.&#34; 
&#62; she smiled to herself, &#34;if they want to mess with me, I'll fix 
&#62; them!&#34;
&#62; 	The monitor mounted on the wall next to the elevator showed the band 
&#62; of four gamers had already found the stairs to Level 14 and were not 
&#62; far from the Level 15 stairs.
&#62; 	&#34;Move it, move it&#34; screamed Lazarus at the bickering witches.
&#62; 	A loud slurping sound came from Bloodlust as she had nearly finished 
&#62; her milk shake. For the first time Lazarus noticed that she still had 
&#62; the curlers in her hair.
&#62; 	&#34;Lusty, the curlers!!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Oh, yeah, I forgot about them. Here Laz hold my burger for me, 
&#62; I'll get them out&#34; Bloodlust said as she pulled the curlers from 
&#62; her hair and stashed them in her belt. She fluffed her hair a little 
&#62; .&#34;There, better?&#34; she asked as she retrieved the burger from 
&#62; Laz's hand.
&#62; 	&#34;Sure&#34;
&#62; 	The elevator doors opened and the four stepped in and Laz pressed 
&#62; the button for Level 15. Within a few seconds they exited the 
&#62; elevator into the Level 15 staging area. There was mass chaos as 
&#62; hundreds of extras bustled about trying to find their initial 
&#62; location. A number of directors were trying to organize the 
&#62; confusion, but were having little success.
&#62; 	&#34;Boy am I glad I'm a boss. At least we get special hoists that 
&#62; put us in place each game, none of this running about to find your 
&#62; mark&#34; Lazarus mused as he strapped himself into his hoist seat.
&#62; 	He could see Red Vex and Blackjade were still arguing as they sat 
&#62; into their hoist chairs and were gently lifted up to be placed on the 
&#62; set. His eyes moved to the large progress monitor mounted on one wall 
&#62; and noted that the group had just begun to descend the stairs to 
&#62; Level 15. They would be cutting it close. He could see that Bloodlust 
&#62; still had a few bites of her burger left as they hovered over the 
&#62; room that they always inhabited. 
&#62; 	It had been cleaned up since the last show, but he could still see 
&#62; bits of debris around the alter. He would have to complain to 
&#62; housekeeping about that.
&#62; 	&#34;What difficulty is this?&#34; asked Red Vex.
&#62; 	&#34;Hell&#34; replied Lazarus as they set the spell level on their 
&#62; equipment to Hell'. At least they could pelt these fools with a 
&#62; powerful jolt, not that whimpy stuff they had to use at normal 
&#62; difficulty seting.
&#62; 	He could hear the sounds of battle, grunts from warriors, fireballs 
&#62; exploding and that little scream that the witches make when slain. 
&#62; They were just going to make it.
&#62; 	The hoists began to lower them into position.
&#62; 	As their feet touched the floor, Bloodlust looked about for a barrel 
&#62; into which to place the wrapper from her burger. There were no 
&#62; barrels in the alter room, never had been. She quickly tossed it 
&#62; behind the alter and ran to take her place elsewhere in the dungeon.
&#62; 	&#34;No one will look there.&#34; she said.
&#62; 	Laz just shook his head.
&#62; 	&#34;Places!&#34; he shouted, just as a plate clad warrior peered 
&#62; around the corner of the doorway.
&#62; 	Action!!!
&#62; 
&#62;               ....................................
&#62; 
&#62; 	The cast was laughing hard as they returned to the bosses lounge 
&#62; after the gig.
&#62; 	&#34;Did you see the look on that warrior's face when Lusty dropped 
&#62; those Godly Curlers of the Ages'&#34; laughed Laz as they all 
&#62; grabbed a beer and flopped onto the couches laughing hardily. 
&#62; 	Suddenly there was the loud sound of a claxon.
&#62; 	&#34;NO!!!!!!!!&#34;</pre>
