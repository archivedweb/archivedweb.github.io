<pre>&#62; Cheating is wrong because it ruins fun for NONcheating players as 
&#62; well as for cheater, except when cheater is best student in school, 
&#62; has 141 IQ and can't speak his NATIVE language....

Eugene is correct (and even using humor well, I'm still laughing).  
Cheating ruins the fun of the game.

Here is the argument against cheating, plaing and simple.  S-R, if we 
were playing Monopoly and I was stealing money from the bank, or if 
we were playing chess and I put a taken Bishop back on the board, or 
if we were playing poker and I was hiding aces up my sleeve, what 
would your response be?  Would you still say people have a right to 
cheat?  Would you still say that cheating was OK?  Or would you 
finally see the light?

I think your hypocritical little self would cry &#34;cheater!&#34; 
real fast.  What makes cheating in Diablo OK, but cheating in other 
games not OK?

Of course, if you would have no problem with others cheating against 
you in these other games, I retract the above statement....
