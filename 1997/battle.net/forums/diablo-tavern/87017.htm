<pre>Greetings,
Everything free is worth what you pay for it. I do not know about 
other countries, but in the US battlenet was advertised as 
&#34;free&#34; service, although we all know where the money for it 
came from. So i did not expect anything from it, even though 
battlenet was the only reason why I bought the game. Blizzard was 
nice enough to let me try it out in shareware, and I loved it so much 
that I had to buy the retail version right away. So there: you have a 
free service, and you put demands on it. That's like telling a friend 
that fixed your car for free that he did a bad job. 
I, for one am tired of constant complaints and people throwing mud at 
Blizzard. We go over it again and again on this forum and nobody 
seems to accept that cheaters and jerks will always be a part of the 
battlenet. They are here to stay, and whining about it is about as 
productive as complaining about bad wheather. Jerks are present 
everywhere in real life and on the battlenet, so just learn to 
protect yourself against them.

1) Ignore them. Use /squelch in chat (double-click on the name if you 
can't type it).
2) Annoy them. ::Hugging:: always works. Tell them you love them no 
matter what they are. ::Hug:: them again. Say you feel their pain and 
that you are sorry their mother did not love them, and that kids pick 
on them at school. If by this time they have not left yet, you can 
start making a public spectacle of them by making jokes that are 
above their level of abstraction. The possibilities for fun are 
endless here. 
If you get killed by a cheating pk, follow them to a few public games 
and warn other players. It not only annoys the hell out of them, but 
also helps others to avoid your fate. 
3) If you want a completely pure environment go to private chatrooms 
and private games. Join a guild; that's what they are here for.
And, please, stop badmouthing Blizzard. Considering how much time I 
spent on the battlenet this is the the cheapest form of entertainment 
I have ever had, and certainly one of the most fun things I have done 
in a long time.
Please, do not misinterpret my intentions. I have no will of flaming 
any of you who posted above. Your outrage is justifiable, I simply do 
not like the way you handle it. I just thought you could use a wake-
up call from the dream world into reality.
Feel free to flame me back if you were offended.

Yours Truly,
Kmicic (KIH)</pre>
