<pre>OK, let me just cut to the chase. I think it has been established 
that at level 49, you get 10,000 exp per kill. If I'm not mistakem, 
it has also been pointed out that the experience needed to jump from 
49 to 50 is 1.3 billion. In addition, most observers seem to believe 
that The Man jumped levels in a two week period, three weeks at most. 
I will use a THREE week period, just to give The Man the benefit of 
the doubt. The Man himself has stated that he played approximately 8 
hours per day over this period. So, how many kills must he make?  1.3 
billion divided by 10000, which is 130,000. He must do this over a 
three week period playing 8 hours a day. Twenty one days times 8 
hours equals 168 hours. One hundred thirty thousand kills divided by 
one hundred sixty eight hours equals approximately 770 kills per 
hour. In one hour there are 3600 seconds (60 min x 60 sec)...3600 
divided by 770 equals 4.67. That means that in order to gain the 
necessary experience to gain level 50 over a three week period, 
playing 8 hours a day, you must kill one monster every 4.67 seconds. 
The Man was using a warrior, and of course he was playing hell hell. 
I am not really experienced with a warrior, and neither am I close to 
level 50, so I will leave it up to the readers of this forum to 
comment on the probabilty of this being done....

Is the big duel still on for tonight at 10:00 central time? Heheh
Please reply, Ogden's readers!

Oh yeah, one other thing...some loser cheat claims to have cloned all 
of the Triad members, and also claims that he will hack account 
numbers so that our clones will have the same account numbers a s the 
real deal..is all of this possible? If so, please keep in mind that 
you may meet a clone of a Triad, and I'm quite sure he will probably 
cheat and be rude to boot...
