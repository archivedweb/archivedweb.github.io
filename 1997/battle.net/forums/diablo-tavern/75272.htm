&#62; 
&#62; Wow, a lot of impostering was going on yesterday while I was busy 
&#62; building my new sexy-rogue(level 20).
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan, I don't know what the hell is going on but you are very very 
&#62; ignoring.  First of you made a lame story about Fluff-Bunny raping 
&#62; SnowRabbit, and secondly you made some sort of ANTI-Talon things...
&#62; 
&#62; I have to clear out one thing people, 
&#62; I DID NOT POST THAT RAPE POST.
&#62; 
&#62; If you think I did it, you are really stupid...
&#62; Why?
&#62; 1.  I was on Battle.net since 8:30 am till 3 pm, building my sexy-
&#62; rogue..
&#62; 2.  After 3pm I went out for work.
&#62; 3.  I came back to home after 12' o clock, and went to B.net again.
&#62; ( I went to the party..he he he...)
&#62; 
&#62; Ask SnowRabbit, he seen me in INFERNO channel after 12'o clock.
&#62; 
&#62; I did not post that message, if I did I'm really a gay.
&#62; I against gays ( I post about this in April).
&#62; I also against any sort of homo-sexual activities.
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan, you see I did not posted the thing, you might seen some 
&#62; elses, probably INFERNO's.
&#62; 
&#62; If you've ever seen my previous posts about adult language( in 
&#62; april), you have to notice that I said : 
&#62; &#34; I will not make more messages that contains sexual 
&#62; descriptions.&#34;
&#62; If you ever remember one of those posts, you have to be certain that 
&#62; previous eX-talon's post is not made by me.  Probably someone else.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAVE HAD HAPPENED....
&#62; After my restless attacks on INFERNO, theman is pissed off, because 
&#62; no-one wanted to join Map-makers.  Theman started to pick on me, 
&#62; because he think I'm just a racial minority, but I didn't care.  I 
&#62; said TheMan uses cheat, Theman gets angry and posted that idiotic 
&#62; rape/homo-xxx post.  That is what I think had happened.
&#62; 
&#62; Many people said &#34;3 post in 30 min??&#34;, well I have an answer 
&#62; for you:
&#62; First off, your ISP connection ask for your phone number/dial number. 
&#62;  Many people turned on as &#34;Default&#34;, in my case I believe 
&#62; that THEMAN's ISP host and my ISP host are the same.
&#62; 
&#62; And Also I don't even know this Fluff-Bunny, he probably a lame idiot 
&#62; like theman.  I don't make fun of other people unless I have evidence 
&#62; that will convince others.  Our merchants ARE powerful and INFERNO 
&#62; are just a little critters.
&#62; 
&#62; Do I know snowrabbit?  No, not that well; but that snow guy sure 
&#62; knows nothing about me.  I don't reply to snowrabbit, cause he is 
&#62; ignoring little fellow, he might be your friend but that doesn't mean 
&#62; he is my friend.  
&#62; 
&#62; See THEMAN, why should I post some stupid post like rape and homos??? 
&#62;  Get a life Little-Man...zzzzz...  
&#62; I hate you and You hate me, but don't ever make those kind of posts 
&#62; to amuse me, rape is not funny...You are mad about merchants aren't 
&#62; you???  once again, get a life.
&#62; 
&#62; So, if you hate me, just say I hate you.  Easy as that.  
&#62; If I get angry I just ignore what ever you do, not like posting 
&#62; sickening post like you.
&#62; 
&#62; If you know a little about This THEMAN, he is a cheater, high 
&#62; tempered, posting messages every 2 hours and a person who have no 
&#62; life at all.  He probably posted that idiotic messages to get rid of 
&#62; me for good, cause my merchant guild is taking away a lot of people 
&#62; from b.net.  TheMan is very zealousy man, ask Eugene/TGS, flux who 
&#62; ever might be.  I can't believe that someone actually uses my name...
&#62; 
&#62; Talon
&#62; I'm accused for nothing...I can't say more, you who've signed that 
&#62; petition are maybe bunch of INFERNO butt kissers.  You guys are doing 
&#62; it because you are afraid that INFERNO will get you back.  Cowards, 
&#62; you who think I really posted that message, you are probably sharing 
&#62; same low IQ as theman's....Have a good life with kissing butt of 
&#62; INFERNO.
&#62; 
&#62; p.s.  
&#62; That eX-Talon's post was disgusting, I mean I'm religious I do not 
&#62; post those stuffs on INTERNET...I almost throw up by reading half of 
&#62; that story...Good setup, TheMan..But some people did not follen in 
&#62; your trikc... ha ha ha...loser.


Haplo, another player, was over at my house when you posted that 
shit. So don't blame me, Talon.

Talon, you got caught.  Face it.  I would NEVER do that to you, I am 
not that petty.  You got caught with your hands in the cookie jar, 
Sticky Ricky.  Sorry to say, I did not do it.  And if you think 
otherwise....then live with it.  Because YOU will be banned.  I did 
nothing.  I have witnesses and was on B.net with a few people to my 
knowledge.

You did this, Talon.  Time to own up.  Blizzard will see otherwise, 
with the evidence I provided.  I wanted you to stay on, you posed no 
threat, as did The Godly Soul.  But fair is fair, and those who break 
the rules get banned.  

Remember your post that you said you could hack your ISP?  Hmm.....
