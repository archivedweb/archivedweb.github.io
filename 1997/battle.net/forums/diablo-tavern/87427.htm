<pre>One day I was pretty bored so I made a Rogue Char and named her 
&#34;Can't_Speak&#34;.  Then I join a game for legits only and after 
not saying  enything for a couple of mins I go down the stairs. I 
find a couple of people there and one of em is a warrior.  So I 
attack with my level  1 rogue (I didn't really want to kill him just 
to get him freaked) well what happened was that I stunned him with 
each shot and he took a little damage (maybe 3 hit points every 10 
shots or so) and I noticed that I took damage as well even though he 
was far too far from me to hit me (either a cheat or an item that 
hurts the attacker).  So after using up my two healing potions I 
died.  Now this guy was so pissed he  was swearing all the time 
standing over my body and trying to still attack me. And I never once 
said a word back, but he just kept going and insulting me thinking 
that I was a female.  I went away from the keyboard for about 10 
minutes and he was still there, but the others joined in.  So now I 
started saying nonsense words like &#34;34f asdh ftru?&#34; this only 
encouraged them more and they followed up with more pathetic insults. 
 After I had a good laugh I left the game satisfied.
