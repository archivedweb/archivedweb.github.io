<blockquote>
<pre>The following is addressed to all members of Inferno, all members of 
the PoC, and all others I know on battle.net.

I'm just going to say it right here: I am leaving battle.net. I have 
grown frustrated to the point at which it seems that player killing 
no longer has a purpose within Diablo - you can't kill one person in 
ten because of all the adolescent cheaters running around. After 
spending hours upon hours and days upon days trying to kill just one 
other player, I have concluded that my time online can be better 
spent than pushing myself through this.

Thus, since I am leaving battle.net, I resign from Inferno. Not only 
the Diablo division, but Inferno UO also. When I designed the Inferno 
UO web page, I knew that the chance of I paying for UO was slim - I 
already pay for my ISP bill, and don't yet have a job (a 15 year old 
kid can't get jobs too easily in a small town like this). I just 
designed the Inferno UO web page to gain a little respect from my 
fellow members, to benefit the federation, and to be recognized by 
some outsiders (I even got kudos from our &#34;sworn enemy&#34; Talon 
/ Sexy-Rogue). I thought I would only reveal this once Ultima Online 
went retail, but not at this current time.

Third, I am formally declining my invite to the PoC. No offense - you 
guys are some of the coolest on battle.net; but if I am never going 
to play Diablo online again, and never pay for UO, where would that 
leave me in the PoC? An observer at most. Personally, I think that 
each member of a guild should at least remain active or serve a 
purpose. If I were to join the PoC, being just an &#34;observer&#34; 
would fulfill neither of these roles.

I feel shook as I leave battle.net. In my online time, I have built 
up a Level 39 Warrior, a Level 30 Sorcerer, and a Level 40 Rogue. I 
had many good times with friends online, playing co-op and 
&#34;deathmatch&#34; games alike (oh yeah, pk too), and feel that the 
time taken to build up these characters has not been wasted - despite 
the times I have had to suffer the antics and ignorance of cheaters.

I will, however, still periodically catch the news on Ogden's Tavern 
and may occasionally logon to battle.net for a chat with friends - 
but it is unlikely that I will ever enter another game again. Diablo 
was a great game long ago, and the people I met were cool, but times 
have changed since then.

It is also highly unlikely that I will ever rejoin Inferno or the PoC 
again. If I did, it just wouldn't feel right deep down inside. Thus, 
if I do return to battle.net or pay for Ultima Online, I will go in 
as a freelance. I say this not out of hatred, but out of respect.

I leave you all now, but I still wish to stay in touch with most of 
you I knew. If you wish to contact me, you may e-mail me, or look me 
up on ICQ under mgP or the UIN 782041. However, tomorrow I will be 
leaving for a 10-day trip, so I will not be able to make contact with 
you until my return.

In a way, I sort of knew it would always come down to this…

Good luck and god bless,

mgP

&#34;Dreams may be shattered, but memories last forever.&#34;</pre>
