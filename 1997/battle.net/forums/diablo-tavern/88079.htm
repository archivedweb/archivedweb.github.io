<pre>&#34;How do I cheat for shareware?&#34;   &#60;------ that has to be 
one of the most pathetic posts I've ever seen here at Ogden's....

My online time at home will be somewhat limited for a while :(  so if 
anyone wants to get a hold of me...use my e-mail addy.  I'll be 
logging on at school during the week to check out Ogden's and my e-
mail but will not be on b.net except on the weekends.  

Umbriel: I'm still gonna try and make it Saturday...

McDeath and Boingo: Thanks for offering the &#34;donations&#34; to 
the Kariyafan telethon...I'm looking forward to upgrading my clunker 
and possible slaying the lag beast.

Tryon: again...it's nice to see you back in action.

Salmissra: Hiya sweetie...how about using Tryon as a pincushion for a 
while....he dies pretty well (and he did make that PMS crack too).

Cohenbarbarian: Looks like you're on your own for a bit with the 
members page...sorry.

Lohlander and Shadowdancer: I'll be adding you guys to my links and 
ICQ respectively, soon.

Morte: I'm ready for that duel now....hehheheheheh...my to hit is 
323&#37;!!!! (without haste though)

Ridcully and Anti_Snoop:  A dog really did eat my homework...no, 
wait, it was a lava maw...yeah, that's it!  A lava maw 
ate...errrr...dissolved my homework.

Anyone with spare computer equipment:  The Kariyafan telethon is 
still in full swing and accepting donations....no, Lord_Chrome, I 
don't want to upgrade to a commodore 64.

Umbriel again: I've got a crooked staff of dyslexia for you along 
with another fool's cap!

Blizzard: Where tf is Diablo 2??????  Come on guys, quit screwing 
around and get it going.  (did I mention I wanna be a beta-tester?)

Mom: Can I borrow $50?

Mrs. Kariyafan: Yes, dear.  I've finished all my homework and I'm 
typing up a paper for work now. (thank god for alt-tab!!!)

Kariyafan_Jr. :  Don't be such a wuss about barrels...just take them 
on one at a time, not in large groups. (sheesh...sorcerors!)

Court_Jester: Tell Umbriel where to stick those 5 fools caps =)

Katana: Where the hell are you, girl!?

Lab technician: When the hell are we gonna get Windows 95 here at 
school?  (hehehehhe...Diablo at school....I love academia!)

Tryon: did you have beans again?

Wirt: stop being such a jerk...break out with the GPOW already!

Grizzy: How about some NICE equipment for a change baldy!?

Adria: ........ (due to space and brain limitations, Kariyafan has 
run out of things to say...thank god!)..............
