&#62; This was posted on LaWizards Chatzone by a person named SF. I found 
&#62; it very interesting. Maybe you will too.
&#62; 
&#62; **********************************************************************
&#62; *********
&#62; Well.. I was not going to post about this. but it seems I have to. 
&#62; 
&#62; A close family member is a well established psychologist, and also a 
&#62; part-time player of UO. The character in the game
&#62; fits the real person to a T. Goes around and &#34;Intervues&#34; 
&#62; Pkers. (after the killing spree, but since this character never
&#62; carries anything it doesnt matter.)
&#62; 
&#62; This is the results, and I might mention, you should take it 
&#62; seriously.
&#62; 
&#62; 80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.
&#62; 97&#37; were male
&#62; 75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
&#62; 85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
&#62; cards taken from parents wallets.
&#62; those are hard facts, Gleaned from the PKers themselfs, From 3 
&#62; different servers.
&#62; These are deductions made from an established psychologist.
&#62; ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
&#62; paranoia.
&#62; 80&#37; leaned towards depression. 
&#62; 70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 
&#62; there are other catagories covered, but most fall under the 40 to 20 
&#62; percentage, so I wont show them.
&#62; 
&#62; What the outcome of this was, That Pkers, as a breed, are making up 
&#62; for serious, real life shortcomings by
&#62; acting out violent actions in a fantasy world where there is no fear 
&#62; of real life retribution. These shortcomings could
&#62; stem from anything from a death in the familly to a low self esteem. 
&#62; Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
&#62; instability, even to the point of needing
&#62; mental treatment. Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
&#62; feelings through this use of virtual killing.
&#62; It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
&#62; they feel this release from real life. If they die.. it
&#62; means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
&#62; again. 
&#62; 
&#62; The Internet itself has always tended to be a haven for people with 
&#62; severe problems. People can act out
&#62; whatever they wish because they feel safe behind the keyboard. 
&#62; 
&#62; One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
&#62; makes it more costly to perform PK, the
&#62; problem will just become greater. 
&#62; 
&#62; There are exeptions, however, we did meet a few people who were 
&#62; actually &#34;roleplaying&#34; the evil, highway
&#62; robber, but most of the people who were pking did it without thinking.
&#62; 
&#62; also, important to note, about 15&#37; were pking because in their 
&#62; opinion, it was the best way to get more
&#62; reagents, when asked why they needed more reagents we were told, to 
&#62; cast more spells to get more
&#62; reagents. When asked why again, we were told, because, its the only 
&#62; way to &#34;win the game&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; go figure.
&#62; 
&#62; And before you flame me, take a moment to think about it. if you 
&#62; still want to flame me, you must be a PKer who felt
&#62; this hit a little to close to home.
&#62; 
&#62; Good day
&#62; 
&#62; *****************************************
&#62; 
&#62; Now I don't know how many people this individual actually sampled, 
&#62; but I don't find anything above all that suprising.
&#62; Do you?
&#62; 
&#62; Take care,
&#62; Serina (Snakegod) 


That guy sounds like a grade A loser.
