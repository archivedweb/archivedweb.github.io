&#62; 
&#62; I've played through the Japanese version already (yes, I can speak 
&#62; and read Japanese very fluently), and although it is a great game, 
&#62; it's far from perfect.
&#62; 
&#62; Its one major flaw is the storyline, which starts off good, but 
&#62; becomes utterly horrible towards the end of the game. I won't get 
&#62; into specifics here, but lets just say that the end of the game was a 
&#62; major disappointment, considering how well done the first 2/3 was. 
&#62; This is something that I really hope is remedied in the American 
&#62; version. Considering all the work that's being put into it (Tetsuya 
&#62; Nomura is designing two new monsters for the American version of 
&#62; FFVII!), I wouldn't be surprised if they beefed up the story a bit. 
&#62; FFVII's linear nature will make it very difficult to for developers 
&#62; to make a drastic change though, and that's really what is needed. 
&#62; 
&#62; All of what I just said was confirmed in Gamefan some months ago by 
&#62; Casey Lo. I'm not making this up, people. This is a real problem that 
&#62; needs to be addressed.

  Yep, I couldnt preach it better than you Junker (one of the lukiest 
individuals that speaks Japanese, I envy you) I own a copy of Final 
Fantasy 7 Japanese Import (wait a minute, what else is there?) but it 
is unfortunate that I use a little electronic dictionary to find 
meanings of MANY (yes, MANY) words in FF7 and I must agree that the 
story lines arent as good as I thought once those words come into 
sense. (maybe I shouldnt have searched for their meanings at all)</pre>
