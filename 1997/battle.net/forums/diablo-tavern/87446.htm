<pre>As you may or may not know I have been talking to some friends in 
Tarot and I may become apart of that guild. 

I had a nice chat with Braveheart last night and so far the guild 
rules sound like things I can live with. As most of you who know me 
know, I have had little interest in joining a guild since mine went 
the way of the Do-Do. But I think it would bring a little interest 
back into this game for me if I started being a little more social.

Just because I think its kind of funny how these things happen 
sometimes I'd like to tell you my view of it. 

I was talking to Zaphod about Tarot, mainly because I used to be 
pretty close to some of the members and I wanted to know how the 
guild was doing. The curiosity was based on the fact that I hadn't 
seen much from Tarot members on this forum and didn't know how they 
were doing. I saw a link to their webpage and so I went and checked 
it out. The first thing you see when you get there if the &#34;King 
of Wands&#34;, I about fell out. You just have to see it for 
yourself,   <a href="http://athena.3-cities.com/~tarot/index.html">http://athena.3-cities.com/~tarot/index.html</a> (Yaz, you 
put together a nice page my friend.)  

Anyway, I started poking around and I noticed that Death was 
represented in the major arcana. I knew Tarot was an anti-PK guild so 
I started wondering if a PK would be allowed in if they held the 
office of Death. So I shot off an email to Zaphod asking about it. I 
think Zaphod took the question as a petition to join and ran with it. 
Not that I minded in the least, as close as I am to Snakegod members 
I just never wanted to join Snakegod, I love some of the people who 
have, but I knew they didn't allow PK's to join. At least not 
practicing PK's. &#60;Nod to my bud Kariyafan&#62; And I have liked 
the idea of Tarot since way back, a guild whose offices are fashioned 
from the cards in a Tarot deck. I thought that was a damn original 
idea and very appropriate for this game. And besides, if they can 
teach Valaska to cook, they can't be all bad. 

So anyway, the next thing I knew I was getting introduced to 
Braveheart, Emperor of Tarot. Very cool person that drinks very good 
beer.  O;) 
So we talked awhile and he laid down the laws of Tarot for me and I 
asked a couple questions and eventually I asked him one he said he 
would need to talk to the rest of Tarot about before he answered. 

So that’s where we are folks, I have decided I would be very honored 
to hold the office of Death within Tarot if they will have me.  
Depending on what Braveheart has to say when next we meet you may be 
addressing me as CudaPrime Member of Tarot Keeper of the Office of 
Death.  (Ever read any Piers Anthony?)  O;)


OK, now for something completely different! 

 -=|)elfontes=-. What the heck is up with this |)el, petitioning PoC? 
I hear they are all legit and PK like mad. Well, this does sound 
interesting, at least I know there will be some PK's out there not 
using GM I can go after. And I know Delfontes PK's, but I thought he 
went after cheaters only. What’s up bud? Give me a shout and let me 
know.

And who can tell me what PoC is about? I know some of the members, 
BLZ, Tracy, Sarco, but I haven't heard from any of em. I obviously am 
going to have to scroll back a few pages of the tavern and see what's 
what. Unless someone would like to enlighten me... Please!  O;)

That’s all folks!

Have Fun!
