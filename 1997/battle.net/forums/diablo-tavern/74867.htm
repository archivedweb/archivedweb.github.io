<blockquote>
<pre>Tarasque flew Medea and N’Ian to a castle not all too far away from 
the lake. N’Ian knew someone, here. The green dragon swooped around 
the castle three times while going down slowly. Then finally, just 
before they were feeling so bad that they would have to spew, 
Tarasque landed gently onto the rocks outside the castle.

A person in a big armor walked to N’Ian making a grim face. He had 
several of warriors following him closely, and he was also 
accompanied by a old and wise-looking sorcerer. „I thought you knew 
someone here&#34;, Medea whispered into N’Ian’s ear.
„See that guy in the big black armor? I know him.&#34;

Only a few feet in front of N’Ian the man stopped.
„You have some guts to come here again, kid.&#34;
„What?&#34;

The man suddenly laughed and hugged N’Ian buddy-like. 
„Where the hell have ya been?&#34;
„Everywhere, just not in this stinking hole&#34;, N’Ian replied and 
grinned evilly.
„That dry humor is going to bring us to our grave someday, 
N’Ian&#34;, Medea added with a grin in her face.

They walked together back to the castle, N’Ian and Tyrone talking 
about the old days. Medea looked at Tarasque sternly, a look that 
said sentences if understood correctly. Two of Tyrones guards stayed 
back to help Tarasque to a place where he would be fed and taken care 
of.

Medea and N’Ian stayed the night in Tyrones castle. They had not even 
taken care of what they had came for. They went to bed in separate 
rooms which Tyrone had prepared for them after a big meal in the huge 
dining rooms of the castle.

N’Ian woke up to the chirping of birds. He vaguely remembered Lord 
Tyrone meeting a messenger in black and red. After his resurrection, 
he had forgotten many things that he used to know. And when he had 
seen the messenger, some hidden memory in him was nagging, trying to 
tell him something. He used to know what that meant. But it seemed 
pointless for N’Ian to ponder what meaning it had.

He walked out onto the balcony made of stone outside his sleeping 
chamber. He wondered what Caius, Eric and Shella were doing right 
now. Again he pondered. And then he was scared out of his thoughts 
when two maiden who work for Tyrone pointed up to him and giggled. At 
this point, N’Ian finally registered that he was naked.

He darted away from the balcony back into the chamber and got dressed 
quickly. Afterwards he mumbled to himself and grinned sheepishly.
„Sheesh.&#34;

He went down to the throne room and met Tyrone on half the way down.
„Say....&#34;, Tyrone began.
„What bothers you?&#34;
„I have no idea what you came here for.&#34;
„Yes I was pondering about that earlier..&#34;
„I know that you were pondering about something, the maiden 
told.&#34; After this sentence, Tyrone chuckled. N’Ian registered the 
situation right away and his face turned red of shame. Tyrone laughed 
loudly and his chest moved up and down from the laughter.

„But what have you came here for?&#34;
Somehow N’Ian had the feeling that Tyrone already knew, but of course 
it was only a stupid feeling, as he would usually say.

„We were wondering  how can regain someone’s soul.&#34;
Tyrone’s face went white of fear.
„Give me a day and the court’s sorcerer will have a solution. I can 
guarantee you this.&#34;

N’Ian nodded with a stern face.
„I’m glad that it will go as soon as you say.&#34;

Another day passed.
Tyrone, his mage Seralion, N’Ian and Medea were sitting at the huge 
round table in the dining room.
Seralion began with a serious, old-sounding voice. He said what had 
to be said shortly: „You must travel to the forest of lost souls and 
recapture the soul. Perhaps the soul-guard might be defending it, but 
I’m sure that he will not give you a hard time.&#34;

N’Ian and Medea looked at each other.
Seralion continued.
„This wretched forest of the damned lies in the east of the castle, 
approximately one hundred kilometers from here. But with your 
dragon... I recall that his name is Tarasque... you should be able to 
arrive there quickly. Once you are there you must be aware, for the 
forest is a true labyrinth.&#34;

Tyrone handed N’Ian a strange scroll.
„They call this the map of stars. It shall help you find the way 
through the forest as quick as possible.&#34;
N’Ian stashed the map into his bag.
„We thank you for your help&#34;, was all N’Ian could say.

Before they left, the were wished fare-well and some people gave them 
food for there voyage to the cursed forest.


And that was part 3. The force wasn’t with me, so it took me some 
time to bring this one out. Same will probably go for part 4 & 5. But 
once summer starts, I’m going to spend my time at home and I will 
bringing these stories out more regularly and in shorter time spans. 
The story will take a nice curve in part 4, I can’t wait for me to 
finish it myself.
