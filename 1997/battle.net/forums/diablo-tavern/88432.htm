<pre>Isnt that always the way? Make Contact with an alien civilization and 
no one believes you. I know that feeling. Oh well, anything that 
Robert Zemeckis directs can come from one of two places: outer space 
and Alabama. Either way its pretty much the same I'd say. Jodie 
Foster acting as good as usual. On a scale of 1 to Z this movie gets 
a &#34;!&#34;, along with a &#34;!+&#34; for originality. I wish that 
there was more in the actual contact scene, but I guess writers didnt 
want to spoil the actual real life contact when it happens. 

OK ladies, gentlemen, and others, you're face to face with non-earth 
sentience, what do you say? You know what I'd say, &#34;OY!&#34; But 
I've always said that to most non-earth sentience, or was that earth 
non-sentience? 

If we ever build a something that connects us to other intelligent 
planets, the first thing we should send is a red herring. You dont 
think that they'd take that the wrong way do you? I know I'm always 
impressed by a nicely ripened red herring myself. Then we can send 
VCR's to prove how complex we are as a race of beings. Along with a 
&#34;how-to&#34; video that tells how to operate a VCR, this would 
prove how dumb we could be. Maybe even we could even get our most 
puzzling questions answered, like, does the light stay on when you 
close the door to the fridge? Or, how many licks does it take to get 
to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop? 

Anywho, I liked this movie, maybe the sequal could be Contact 2: The 
Line is Busy, Please Hang Up and Try Again. Or, Contact 2: The Bill. 
Should we use 1-800-COLLECT? I bet we'd get fined roaming charges 
though. oh well, such is the nature.
