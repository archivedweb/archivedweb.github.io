&#62; Most of you may recognise at least one of my names; Wiseman. Many of 
&#62; you, of course, may not. Of course, we can forget the name thing. It 
&#62; does not really matter who I am, or indeed who any of us are. Well, 
&#62; it seems that way. Just a warning - anyone who'll be offended if 
&#62; this post isn't really about Diablo better leave now.

  I don't know you, but I know some things about you.  I know you 
are a talented writer, and I know you post these stories you've 
worked on in exchange for nothing more than a kind word.  
  I'm one of those that believe the good things in the world are 
the result of a lot of small actions.  I can't change the 
amount of money that is spent on advertising, but I can be a 
responsible consumer and buy my products on the basis of the 
quality, not the glitz, or learn about the company and support
those that are environmentally responsible.  
  I can't rid the streets of crime, but I can get involved in 
youth groups and just perhaps make a tiny amount of headway 
against it.  

  I don't know what to say to you... I wanted you to know another
person out here heard and cared.  So each of us are taking a small
amount of time to let you know you're not alone... maybe we're 
making a difference, maybe we're not, but you have to keep trying.

  Esac mantioned that he was a parent, and that his time is taken
up in supporting and caring for his family, leaving the impilcation 
that therefore he didn't have time to try and make the world better.  
I am also a parent, and I feel that providing a caring environment 
for my family IS making the world better.  Hopefully my kids have 
learned that other people are important, and they will in turn care 
for the people in their future.  

  The one thing you should not do is look at the problems of the 
world and despair.  If it a great concern of yours, then pick ONE 
problem and work on it.  Find organizations that support your view, 
and participate in trying to solve the problem.  Find politicians who 
agree with you and support them.  The fact that these organizations 
and politicians exist are a positive sign.  

  There are always going to be materialistic people out there who 
measure their happiness by how much they own.  You can't worry about 
them.  The vast majority of them will never accumulate enough to 
become satisfied, and will never learn to be happy with what they 
have. 

  Well, I could go on and on about this.  

&#62; Am I the only person out of all the people I know that worries about 
&#62; the world and the direction the human race is heading? How can I 
&#62; presume to say it? What gives me the right to speak?

  You are obviously not... find others who feel as you do and strive 
to make a difference.  

&#62; ceased to care about our environment. We choose to escape from our 
&#62; responsibilities by watching television, or spending endless hours 
&#62; attempting to realign electrons in our character information files, 
&#62; trying to prove our worth by attaining something that does not 
&#62; really exist.

  There are without a doubt people who use television and computer 
games as an escape from reality and responsibility.  But, you will 
not enrich their lives by rubbing their noses in the fact.  If this 
is the problem you wish to address, then help provide alternatives to 
these people.  Work with youth groups and help draw these kids to 
other activities. 
  There are also without a doubt, people who use television and 
reading and computer games as a diversion.  A way to relax, for fun 
and a sense of accomplishment.  There are positive aspects to these 
things.  Take Diablo for instance... [OOTC]  I enjoy the game, it 
fits well with my temperment and capabilities.  What am I proving by 
playing the game?  Well, that I can stick with things, that I'm 
willing to invest time in a goal I've set for myself.  If you are a 
coop'er you can help increase someone else's enjoyment, or just share 
it.  And I think these are worthwhile things.  
  My self worth is not tied to accomplishments in this game, but I 
can enjoy a sense of accomplishment in recovering my equipment from a 
sticky situation, or recognizing the futility of attempting, and 
going on to rebuild.  

Geez!  I really am starting to ramble on... perhaps someday we'll 
have the opportunity to sit down and discuss these things...  I'd be 
interested in that.  

&#62; I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this 
&#62; world, you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way 
&#62; to this point. I suppose you are reading this because you logged on 
&#62; today, looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to 
&#62; have disappointed you.

  You have not disappointed me.  If you do not recognize that most of 
the replies following your message are in a way, attempts to address 
some of the problems you mention.  That the feelings of someone we 
have never met are still important enough to us to invest some of our 
time.  That we are not only acknowledging your feelings, but in our 
shared experiences, and viewpoints, and advice, we are trying in a 
small way to help.  
  If the fact that we care has not come through, or that it is of 
little concern to you, THEN I am disappointed.

&#34;And I'm going to spend some time on my vacation playing Diablo, 
because I find it refreshing and challenging and satisfying.  And I'm 
going to come here to try and find someone to share this with.  If 
you read this, and think this is lame, then *you* are in the wrong 
place, not me!&#34;</pre>
