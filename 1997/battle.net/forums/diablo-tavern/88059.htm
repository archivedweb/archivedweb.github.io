<blockquote>
<pre>The night is black. The moon, set against a starlit background 
conceals the army marching below it. No sound emanates 
from the forms slowly marching through the hills. Not even a 
whisper. A curious form drifts out of the sky noticing its prey 
on the ground near this silent column. Swooping down,  the 
form grabs its intended target and starts flying away from 
this unearthly parade. In a movement so quick, a hand shoots 
out grabbing the now struggling form, crushing it. Tossing the 
limb form to the ground, the army slowing moves onward
 towards its destination.

&#34;Sir, there's something headed this way. I've never 
seen anything like it.&#34;
&#34;Is that all you have to report?&#34;
&#34;Yes, Captain.&#34;
&#34;Then be on your way. Tell my sergeants to meet here 
immediately.&#34;
The boy heads out the door in search of his superiors.
What is this thing moving towards my city, thinks the Captain. 
A figure in a leather armour strides in &#34;You wanted to see 
me, Captain?&#34; 
&#34;Please sit down, Garrion. Let's wait for the others to show 
before we start discussing something that may be a threat to 
our very existence.&#34;
Sitting down, Garrion waits impatiently for the other to get here. 
Hearing sounds outside the door, two more figures come in and 
sit down. Only one more, thinks Garrion. Then we will get down 
to the bottom of this.

A light shows in the hills. 
Finally, my time has come. I shall not wait, and I shall not be 
defeated. 
A lone figure stands atop a hill near the silent army. 
This time I will not lose. 
&#34;I WILL NOT LOSE!&#34; , shouts the lone figure standing above 
his army. Insane laughter flows over the forms of the creatures 
he has collected. 


Tell me what you think. This is my second story. I will post
my first story in just a minute
