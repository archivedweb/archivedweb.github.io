<pre>Ok,

We all know what The Man wants.  Power, followers, ass-kissers, 
personal servants.  We also all know how is trying to go around 
getting them.  Through mindless posts calling PoC quitters, losers, 
etc..  However, in spite of The Man's constant drivel, everyone has 
still managed too see through his air-headed scheme.

This is what i think.  If The Man wants to declare war.  Let him 
declare war.  If The Man wants to summon an army and hunt PoC down, 
let him summon an army.  If The Man wants to command massive forces 
of ass-kissers.  Let him have them.

Check out these &#34;numbers&#34;:

When PoC split a huge chunk of INFERNO was taken with it.  Maybe 
around half.

The remaining INFERNO members were weakened but not destroyed.

Then, a few days later, another large chunk of members left to form 
MAYHEM.  

All this splitting has left the NI with about 5 members, give or take 
a few.  Here they are:

The Man
Haplo
Flux
James_HetField
Jaded_Hero
Solar_Flare
A.K._Legacy
Mitchel

Here's my prediction of what will happen VERY SOON.  Flux will leave 
INFERNO.  Where she goes, i don't know.  She probably disappears.  
A.K. and Solar (who are good guys) get so frustrated in their 
attempts to revive INFERNO that they end up quitting and joining 
MAYHEM.

So...here's what's left of INFERNO:

The Man
Haplo
Jaded_Hero
James_Hetfield
Mitchel

My point:  There really is no INFERNO left.  The guild that The Man 
claims to control consists of 5 people.  Let The Man have his 
&#34;imaginary army&#34;.  He will just fade slowly back into the 
pile of BS from where he came.  If by chance he does survive until UO 
he will probably go insane.  Eugene, I, and the rest of PoC will kill 
him so many times that something will *snap* and he'll flee to some 
remote cave in Alaska.

Just my predictions....

Later,
Tibbar-Wons
Animal of Mystery

*snap*</pre>
