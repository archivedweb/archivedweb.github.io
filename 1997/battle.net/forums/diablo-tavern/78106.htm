<blockquote>
<pre>I read some of the posts on putting restrictions on pks.  Around the 
Fall of 96, I was a beta tester for &#34;Legends of Kesmai&#34;.  
They permitted pking, but they but restrictions on it so the game did 
not turn in Quake.  It involved Alignment, and an Underworld.  I 
think Diablo would benefit greatly from incorperating these 
factors(or at least something along that line).


Alignment:  All characters start off Good and with 0 Karma points  
You're number of Karma points determines your alignment(i.e. more 
points, the &#34;worse&#34; your alignment) , which is reflected in 
the color of your name.  When you kill a player, you get 1 Karma 
point.  There are two exceptions to this rule.  You will not received 
a Karma point if, 1. the player is Evil or Neutral 2. the player 
attacked you first with the intent of killing you(Blizzard can figure 
out how to determine when the attack is on purpose).  In any 
curcumstance, if you kill me (and you recieve a karma point), I have 
the can &#34;forgive&#34; you with a command in a chat room.  The 
&#34;forgive&#34; erases that one point.

 So now you're asking, okay what is the point of that?  The point is 
the number of Karma points you have affects what happens to you when 
you enter the Underworld.

Underworld:  You are sent to the Underworld after you die, say for 
instance, 5 times.  In the Underworld, the character is reduced to 
starting stats, and equipment(potions, items, everything) is dropped 
at the site of death.  To leave the Underworld, you must complete 
erands for the demons/gods living there.  The more Karma points you 
have, the more(and harder) errands there are.  If you &#34;die&#34; 
in the Underworld it does not really matter since you won't lose 
anything, and you will just be taken back to the starting point.

So in the UnderWorld, if your are &#34;good&#34;, you have to carry 
an elixir of magic to a wizard.  If you are &#34;evil&#34;, you have 
the same quest, but this time you have to pass through a room with 
about 20 hellspawn at only 50 hp, 0 magic resistance, and no weapon.

I understand you all at Blizzard would have to do some programing for 
this to work, and also find a way to stop cheaters from just editing 
their karma.  But how else can you regualte this?  I don't mind 
pkers, they make the game more interesting, but when you run in to 
one almost every hour, it gets old real quick.

Note: Bounty Hunters will not suffer from Karma points, since Good 
chacters would not be pks, and since killin gNeutral or Evil 
characters does not give you a point.  </pre>
