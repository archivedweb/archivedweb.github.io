<pre>in constant continuation:
I give you 

Saga 11
Though the town seemed to be alive with activity, Snakegod warriors 
running around trying to discern from whence the foe was approaching, 
belows of demonic hordes could be heard at the far outskirts of the 
town. The lords made their way west of the town, across a almost 
shattered bridge which they had used many a time in the hope pf 
finding some good equipment for sale at the wooden legged boys stall. 
Kariyafan sensed the nearby danger, his mind awash with visions of 
the up coming struggle, something was not right, he braced himself, 
grabbing Strelka's shoulder
&#34;I am afraid, I fear this is the last day I see the sun rise&#34;
Strelka stood back, he could sense the danger too, but he had learnt 
to block such feelings, he stood puzzled watching carefully as 
Torquemeda approached a rock outcrop, sinking to a low stance waiting.
&#34;Come, we shall sit by these rocks&#34;, leading Kariyafan they 
moved cautiously, trying to discern the sounds that emmanated from 
the hills to the north of the town.
Torquemeda knew that they would be greatly outnumbered, the strength 
of the Moredrim was evident, they had ripped through the villagers 
they had passed by, and he thought that other strengths lay within 
them.
&#34;We must summon our brethren, prepare yourselves&#34;, Torquemeda 
was stern, but he sensed the mounting fear within Kariyafan, and he 
knew that this fear could be the death of them all, kneeling he 
called forth his mind's eye, feeling Strelka's and Kariyafan's join 
with his, as they soared above the town, flitting through the forest 
trees, onward towards Inferno castle.
Elijah and Curunir sat playing a game, the object of which they care 
not for, they enjoyed throwing past victims ears around the room, and 
felt at ease with the stench of decay. Curunir suddenly seemed set as 
stone, his eyes rolling into the back of his head, as the joined 
minds of his brethren surged into his, melding, passing thoughts. 
Elijah stood quickly, dropping his favorite ear casually onto the 
floor, clasping Curunir firmly, steadying him. When the call had been 
sent, Curunir having regained his composure, turned to Elijah
&#34;We are needed my friend, great danger lies in the town of 
Tristram, we are to ride immediately, call on the others, and great 
battle is to be fought&#34;, a demonic grin passed across his face, 
Elijah knew that look, and smiled openly. &#34;Come let us gather the 
others, I am in need of a good fight&#34;
Curunir bounded out of the room, grabbing Morte as he ran out of the 
door, soon the party was ready and the Inferno sorcerers dressed in 
the ceremonial black plate armor with the Inferno emblem shining in 
red mounted their horses and rode out of the castle at a canter.</pre>
