<pre>&#62; I know it's cheating. It would kill all the fun of the game. But 
&#62;it's 
&#62; really pathetic to be in the catacombs hacking away and some jerk 
&#62; comes along and starts fireballing the hell out you when your trying 
&#62; to get the goatmen off of someone else. Happened to me twice last 
&#62; night. I assume they do that so they can take ALL your stuff instead 
&#62; of just your ear. I realize that your going to get hit occasionally 
&#62; .... it happens, but when someone does it on purpose or even worse 
&#62; when the guy that you just helped does it it really makes it not 
&#62; worth the trouble. What do you do in that situation? Let em die? Grab 
&#62; their stuff and scatter it all over the place? It just doesn't seem 
&#62; to be worth the effort. I'd rather not play than drop down to that 
&#62; level.

Here is what I usually do.  I start a game called Legits only and 
then wait in town or better yet go down and get some exp or gold and 
once someone joins then go back up to town.  Then I check out their 
hit points to see if they are cheaters and wait for more people to 
come in.  If no legits then I leave the game and repeat the process.  
If one or two come then I ask them for private game (most will 
accept) and there you go.  Also you could go to channels called 
&#34;legit&#34; or maybe &#34;legit2&#34; to ask people for a private 
game. Make sure that the op is anti-cheater (if he kicks out cheaters 
then he is and if he kicks you then he is not). Sometimes in those 
rare events when a legit of my level creates a game I make it a must 
to join it (then start a priv game if cheaters are present). Well 
anyway the more levels you gain the less you will be attacked, the 
more chance of pressing esc and then new game and finally the more 
chance of kicking their un-skilled buttocks.
