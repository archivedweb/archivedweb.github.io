Diablo: Quest for Tarot
Chapter I

There has never been so many stories told in a civilization. From 
around each winter's hearth, as well as besides each summer's forest 
bon, tales are told in rememberance of the past. Stars are said to 
twinkel  in delight for each word spoken to an audence of an 
adventure. Mixed in the seeds of time and chorus stands the word 
&#34;Tarot,&#34; which, for one reason or another, seems to echo the 
heathen side.

Gijo knows. He's heard the tales and seen re-enactments of  its rise 
and fall through drunkard's theater. This both angers and saddens 
him, for the sport they play on the memory of his own kind is unjust. 
Had they known, they would dare not play upon the name of 
&#34;Tarot.&#34;

However, this story begins much earlier in time.

In the city of Daleshaw, festivities grew rampant. Word has just 
spread of King Leroic's new born son, Prince Albrecht, and that the 
omens under the new moon proved promising. The crops will be 
pleantiful, the weather will be kind, and the houses will be bleesed 
by their gods. This is a time of rejoice.

The house of Kai was no exception.

Gijo Doi La'Kai is a young man of 20 seasons. He enriches himself 
with mild ale as he walks down the court yard. Several members, such 
as Gijo, harvest the celebration and clamor in audence. A young boy 
approaches him.

&#34;Gijo!&#34; says the boy of  five cycles, &#34;Gijo! Look, 
Gijo!&#34;

Gijo kneels onto one leg to embrace the boy. He then lifts him into 
his arms and stands forth.

&#34;What have you to show me, young Daknit?&#34; he replied. The 
boys gave a wide grin at the call of his own name. Daknit rolled his 
sleeve back on his right arm.

&#34;See?&#34; Daknit said, &#34;I'm just like you now.&#34;

&#34;So, you are, are you?&#34; Daknit bobs his head in agreence, 
&#34;You want to be a knight? Well  then, you have a long ways to go, 
yet.&#34;

Gijo looks around to survay the crowd. There is a slight frown as he 
speaks. &#34;Where's your mother?&#34;

Daknit looked down  at the ground. A bit of life left his eyes. 
&#34;She feel over. They said to come to you.&#34;

&#34;I see. Come then; I'll take you to your quarters.&#34;


A servant moves aside a door of marble to reviel a room dimly lit by 
slender tourches. Gijo escorted Daknit into his dwelling. Daknit runs 
of to his bedside as Gijo pauses to scan the room; you can never be 
to careful now a days.

Flux laid upon her bed, passed out from ale most likly. Gijo shoke 
his head and gave a slight sigh. He never did aprove of her.

&#34;Gijo?&#34; asked a whisper from the shadows. Gijo came to 
Daknit's side and kneeled down to his eye level.

&#34;Yes, Daknit? What is it?&#34;

&#34;Do you have to leave?&#34;

&#34;Don't worry about it, I only live down the hall.&#34;

Daknit closed in of Gijo for a great whisper that held his truest 
secrete. &#34;Mother is different. She's changing.&#34;

There was a pause for Gijo to take in what he might have ment by 
this. &#34;Has she been yelling at you again?&#34; Daknit nods slowly 
&#34;There is nothing I can do until daylight. Your mother cannot be 
reached right now.&#34;

&#34;She wants to kill me.&#34;

&#34;Why would she wish that upon you?&#34; Gijo looks over to his 
new brand of the house. &#34;Because you are one of us now? Daknit, I 
promise she can do nothing to you. Rest awhile.&#34;


In the morning, a messanger came to Gijo as he ate oat meal to tame a 
mild hunger. King Leroic requested guards to his son. Each of the 15 
houses slected thier best and Gijo was summoned. 

The messanger and his escorts hurried Gijo along. Daknit appeared to 
see what the latest news. Flux moved stealthly behind.

&#34;Congradulations upon your calling,&#34; Flux said upon 
enterance, &#34;I'm sure this is a true test of honor for the 
house.&#34;

&#34;Indeed,&#34; Gijo replied. There was somehting about the way she 
said it that un-nerved him.

&#34;Gijo?&#34; Daknit looked up at Gijo, &#34;Take me with you.&#34;

&#34;I would love....&#34;

Flux interupted him loudly. &#34;He will stay behind, I'm afraid. 
Daknit, you will have to deal with him not being here any more. Some 
things are best that way because they were never ment to be.&#34;

&#34;I will return someday. I promise.&#34; He looks at Flux, 
&#34;Might I have a word with you?&#34;

&#34;There is no time, sire.&#34; spoke one of the escorts, &#34;The 
king requests you presence by nightfall.&#34;

Flux smiled. Yes, this journey will pay a heavy ride.

&#34;I shall return, Daknit.&#34; And with that, he left.

In the shadows of night, Flux ventures her way through the alley way 
in the city. She wears a hood cape with a dagger of poison at her 
side. Quietly she strides to the hidden enterance and slides inside.

A small fire takes presidence in a corner of the room. An elderly man 
awaits her appearence.

&#34;The deed is done,&#34; She states. &#34;The House of Kai has 
been killed.&#34; She draws the dagger to glimmer the blood stains in 
the light. &#34;They have all been killed in their sleep.&#34;

&#34;Diablo would have wanted it no other way,&#34; replied the elder 
with a chrisp voice, &#34;We have changed fate. The visions mean 
nothing now. No longer is the concern of that great opposition from 
the house of Kai. To think a hero of such standards whould be killed 
in such a way. Pitiful.&#34;

&#34;So, the envisioned one is dead?&#34; there was doubt behind her 
voice.

A small paused passed for the crackling of the fire. &#34;Burn down 
the house tonight has a symbol of your new loyality. Let it rage in 
an inferno.&#34;
