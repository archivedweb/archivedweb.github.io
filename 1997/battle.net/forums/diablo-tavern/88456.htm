Chapter 3


Dark Genesis


The Void breathes it’s endless eon dust, and in it’s path attracted  
wandering  newborns to exist.
Space and Time growing eternal.
Space was the hard sister, her physical and logical face ignited 
galaxies and multitudes.
Time however, the whimsical brethen, had a more shrouded approach, 
not slave to laws.
Thus it was so that time within it’s own cocoon created the mirror 
into which his fabric became two.
The first image was* Statis * , an eternal purple shadow, even space 
was affected ever so subtly by this temporal anomaly, yet so well 
hidden,
Space remained detached, arrogant in it’s bright suns and stellar 
songs.
Statis brought forth many children, free to roam the harsh laws of 
space.
&#34;Who are these misguided creatures that sprawl the length of my 
being?&#34; cried the stars.
&#34;Hush! dear  Sister not so loud , from the copper tails of comets 
to the ultimate light of Novas the Deamons are carved,and the 
darkness of the Void possess their dreams&#34;.    
&#34;But they are not of my mind&#34; replied a passing cosmic beam.
&#34; Very well I will provide you another cast in which you can mold 
your children.
Make them soft as the earth and hard as Diamond’s eyes, fluid like 
the winds of the fareway moons and bind them in me&#34; 
Space to create accepted the gift and so came Humans , the mortals.
That second facet of time was known as *The Turn*
Deamons, being first, could exist in both times, however Space 
dictated the Turn and so the children of Darkness obeyed the laws it 
imposed. Hate was learned. 
Slowly the races took dominions and sides, then conflicts arised deep 
in the bowels of space.

The Undead’s logics and Unhumanities.
The primal cycle.
By Baltazar First scribe.


Baltazar surveyed the grand room, seated stiftly  the multitude of 
skeletons cracked their fissured appearances with many still glances 
towars the overlords and their leader.
He could not care less about the ebony wimps as he called them, he 
fingered the solid steel he carried and pointed at the skeletons..
He whispered to his beloved cleaver; &#34;Yes I know you want some 
bones to crack don’t you?&#34;
Weaving left and right, back and forth the zombies silently sat near 
the bottom of the marble auditorium.
Silently? Well maybe not, a occasional  squished dropping of body 
parts added a dreadful element to the deamon’s constant  sonorous 
discord .
yet it was rhythm almost a pulse, it echoed broadly within the dark 
underworld giving a rich texture of many coats. 
The walls ,always grey, were shaped by many accounts of violence.
Some crude nicks and scratches, witnesses to mortal attitudes, 
painted the corridors beneath the pale  dancing gold of the torches.
Still the Undead cadence as a heart beating a slow, momentous destiny.
Baltazar looked at them, paused a second to take it all in and 
sighed, aknowledged each sound, each beat 
each purpled shadows.
&#34;Let it be completed&#34; almost a incantation.
&#34;Where is king Leoric?&#34; he questioned to the nearest bones..
Blank looks and dry mutterings , questions of their own.
The butcher did not even pretend to be polite.
&#34;He is probably drunk out of his skull.&#34; He offered, driving 
his meaty elbow into the ribs of a zombie seated next to him.
His poke sank in , deeply and wet. He pulled more meat out than  went 
in.
&#34; Damn should know better, dead meat&#34; said he.
A shy  squeak  barely rose above the deep breathing of the Butcher.
&#34;Sir I know of a king that sleeps the sleep of  tired bones&#34;  
the small voice was coming from above Baltazar’s head.
A  swooping Blink bat , then it was gone.
&#34;The hard pearl monarch I have heard&#34; This time it was from 
behind him and again was gone as Bal turned..
&#34;Stop that&#34; exclaimed the Fallen one.
&#34;I may not for it is my nature&#34; blinked the bat
and added with a  flapping of a disappearing wing.
&#34;I hear him wake and his feet scrapes the floor&#34; this time 
the bat perched on the podium and stared at Baltazar, it’s little 
head turning slightly as if to smell the distant sounds.
Blink..
&#34;I knew it&#34; The butcher jumped up and accused the skeletons .
&#34;Slackers! All of you&#34; and proceeded to chop some butts.
&#34;Do you recall your first passion&#34; a cool voice studied the 
Overlord.
And another probe, &#34; was it blood?&#34;
The  butcher looked around confused and at loss, the coldnest felt 
familiar, intimate...

  
Thank you all for keeping me in touch with my creative side.

Sincerely
