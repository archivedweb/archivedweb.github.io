<pre>PK'ing hmmmmmm you think about it. What is it?
PK'ing is the act of killing a person in any way, shape, or form on 
the GAME (Hear me I say the word GAME) of Diablo. A GAME is a fantasy 
NON-REAL-LIFE device of entertainment. Should we take our games 
seriously? hmmmmmmm NO!!!!! And besides PK'ing does not involve real 
life chopping heads off. It shouldn't hurt you mentally or physically 
and if it does you need to be in the hospital. I recommend if you 
don't want to be PK'ed just avoid the person or get a new game. 
Frankly people on Battle.Net should know that any public game may 
have cheaters and pk's in it. It's a risk you have to take when your 
in a public game. I have noticed that people on Battle.Net don't know 
what the meaning of a passworded game is. I'm sick of seeing people 
having a game and then come crying back out because someone killed 
them and then they start begging for stuff (I'm not implying that 
everyone begs). If you don't want to be PK'ed here is some advice 
find a channel like HONOR or LEGIT or something like that. Generally 
those channels have legits that will be willing to play and I say 
90&#37; of the time won't kill you. Also you people who get PK'ed 
need to get a Diablo Eye so you can see whether people are cheating 
or not. I say that at least 70&#37; PK's do cheat. I'm sick of people 
on forums and chat rooms complaining about PK's. They are another 
part of Battle.Net you will have to live with forever. PK'ing isn't 
morally wrong or anything like that. If it was morally wrong then 
Blizzard would of not put the ATTACK PLAYER button in. I suggest that 
99&#37; of the people on Battle.Net and on here need to look up the 
definition of COMMON SENSE and REAL LIFE also FANTASY and then think 
about those terms and put them into use.

If you plan on flaming me please think about what your going to write 
and I'll let you know now that I'm mature enough to not let little 
petty stuff like this bother me.
