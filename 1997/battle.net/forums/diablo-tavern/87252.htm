&#62; &#62; Cheating is wrong because it ruins fun for NONcheating players as 
&#62; &#62; well as for cheater, except when cheater is best student in school,

&#62; There ya go Shut you ass up fucken cheater!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Talon AKA Sexy-Rogue,


Here's my counter-attack, no flames or spams on you.


When I started my Diablo Career in early Feburary, you can enter a 
public game without any worry from hackers and cheaters. During the 
&#34;Golden Ages&#34; (Old Days), you can PK a player, Hunt down a 
PK, and co-op together. In those days, Battle.net was hot then. The 
number of people that logged on was around 8000. On a Saturday night 
was over 9000 users. In those days, legits ruled b.net. When TK was 
around, there were legit hunters and pkers too. 

The next part is about the dark ages (1.03v). When the patch that 
destoried TK came out, the cheats started to increase, and at the 
same time, duping was born. When the dreaded 1.03v came out, ghost 
and god mode was born. These cheats destoried public games and many 
guilds (Co-oping, pkers, and b.hunters). When the person founded and 
used the duping bug as an cheat, the person destoried trades. The 
loyal diablo legit players now hid in private games during 1.03v 
because of ghost and god mode. 

The last part is up to today(1.04v). When this patch was out, it was 
all too good. This patch got rid of ghost and really high level 
players in games. The cheats came back in 3-4 hours of the patch. The 
Golden ages were nothing more than a faded memory. Now everyone has 
god mode in public games. Now newbies wear dupes and hacks. Now 
Cheater/PKers have god mode to kill legits. The latest trainer not 
only edits your own stats but another player (Talk about invadition 
of privitcy). You see Talon, the cheaters are ruining a good game. 
There are less Legit co-opers, Pkers and B.hunters in public games. 
The cheaters ruined a good game. 

Read this Talon and think about it. 

Darkwing (AAF)

PS- Talon, each time a new cheat is out, it kills the game even more.</pre>
