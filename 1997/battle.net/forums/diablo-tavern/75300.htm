&#62; I am stuck on level 15 and don't know where to go from here :-(
&#62; can anybody help ?
 If you are playing on Single player, here's what you do:
(this is an excerpt from Diablo's Lair at 
<a href="http://www.dreamflyr.com/~sdformo/lair.html">http://www.dreamflyr.com/~sdformo/lair.html</a>  This is a great site, 
and as I know little about single I firgured I would copy and paste. 
If this is a copywright violation email me from above)

 Lazarus's level is a difficult one. Once you reach level 15, you 
should immediately notice Lazarus's staff on a 'Vile Rack' next to 
the stairs. Grab the staff and bring it back to Cain, he'll tell you 
a story and all that and take the staff off your hands. (Lazarus's 
staff does absolutly nothing, by the way.) Go back down to level 15 
(after stocking up on everything, and grab as many fire spells as you 
can) and look around for a red portal.
Step in it. It should take you to a place with the church tile set to 
it. This is Lazarus's level. In here is mostly hell spawns and mages. 
This level is VERY small. Not far to go just to circle the place. 
Now, go out and kill everything before using the books you find. This 
includes killing the hell spawns behind the iron gate walls. They 
will piss you off later if you don't... Now, walk onto one of the 
gray circles you find and touch the book. This will teleport you 
inside the iron gate area where those hell spawns used to be. A new 
room should be opened up as well, more hell spawns will walk on out 
and shoot you. Kill them and go to the second circle and do the same 
for the first. Once everything is dead, prep all your fire spells 
especially fire wall spells. Go back to the circle you appeared in 
the dungeon on, and step on it. This warps you to Lazarus's room and 
shows you a short but nice cut-sceen of Lazarus. When he's done doing 
his talking, run from his room, otherwise he's going to kill you 
while you worry about the other hell spawns. Kill all the hell 
spawns, then go back and kill Lazarus. A nice stone curse spell works 
great on him. Once he's dead, a red portal will open up where you 
entered his level. Now your free and done with him.

OK.. On multi-player (this ones my own... not an excerpt).
  On multi player Lazarus is an easy quest. His room is in the top 
corner of lvl 15, and usually has many knights and witches 
surrounding it.  once inside the room, you will find:
2 hell Spawns
Red Vex
(Black?) Jade
Lazarus himsef
4 or so mages

Red Vex and Black Jade are succubi mini bosses.
Try to kill the mages and hell spwns first. The unique enemies are 
tough, and you want to take as little damage as possible when you 
take the time to kill them.
Once the room is clear, look around for a big red pentagram which 
comes with a roomfull of baddies. You may have found this before, but 
it looked like part of the scenery. Now it is a portal to 16.

I hope this helps,
