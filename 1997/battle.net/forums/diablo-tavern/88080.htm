&#62; This damned hat.  Its costing me more then i thought possible.  How 
&#62; so?  Well for starters, it has now munched on eight Hidden Shrines.  
&#62; Pay-off for this?  A duration of one. ONE!!!
&#62; Yeah, i guess that is enough to be pissed about, 'cept i got one more 
&#62; gripe with my hat now.
&#62; 
&#62; The other day while out leveling DarkWalker i found a shrine.  Good 
&#62; thing there where several other Tarots in the game, so i left and 
&#62; came back as nIGHT.  I bought a sword from Gris and went to visit the 
&#62; shrine.  I removed everything from my person, save for my cap and a 
&#62; sword.  Unfortunately i did not have enough room for my Stormshield, 
&#62; so i laid it at my feet.  At that moment that my modem chose to go 
&#62; &#34;click&#34;.  &#34;Click?&#34; i thought to myself.  Uh-oh, 
&#62; better use the shrine before i disconnect.  I used the shrine...  
&#62; Well that sword better appreciate the effort i put into raising its 
&#62; dur. by 10.
&#62; I stooped to pick up my shield only to discover it was lodged into 
&#62; the floor of the catacombs.  Damn thing wasn't coming up.  No matter 
&#62; how hard or many times i tried, the shield remained put.
&#62; I left the Cats, then returned thinking my departure might loosen it. 
&#62; Nope, stuck.  I left the game a rather pissed nIGHT.
&#62; 
&#62; So total cost for a cap dur. 1/1.  Eight Hidden Shrines and one 
&#62; StormShield.
&#62; 
&#62; Pls, someone post here and tell me they have seen worse.
&#62; 
&#62; later.

At least you have one! I can't find one for the life of me. Actually, 
Mandrake of the Triad had a similar horrible experience with a hidden 
shrine recently. On battlenet he found a hidden shrine, and his cap 
was currently duration 11. Well, then he made a somewhat foolish 
mistake...he bought junk items to take with him to the shrine, but in 
order to carry them, he hid his Royal Circlet in town I 
think...anyway, when he used the shrine he immediately noticed the 
horrible sight of the cap icon that tells you that it is near 
destruction (because the Thinking Cap was now durability one)...but 
then, the worst part happened..he timed out of the game..lost his 
Royal Circlet. You can bet he won't be sitting one of those down 
again(when he finds another one).</pre>
