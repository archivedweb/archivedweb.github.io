<pre>Since everyone in Ogden HATE cheaters (except me), we should have a 
vote!   I think we should post our votes and concerns about cheaters 
on the forum, so everyone can see why cheat is bad/wrong/whatever.  I 
think we should clear this fair RIGHT NOW!  

We should have a vote against CHEATING.  If you guys have more than 
20 votes on this messages, I will shut my mouth about CHEATERs.  But 
there is one condition, if there is more than 10 vote for cheaters, 
you lose.  (that counting me on, too)

Isn't this a great idea???  We can settle this cheater discussion on 
ogden for good.  

*Caution for All who want to vote*
1.  Remember to put your name and guild name(if you have one.)
2.  Please, put some counterattacks for CHEATERS, (NT) doesn'y count 
for vote.
3.  Do not ask about my IQ or my grammar or anything about me, just 
put your thoughts/belief about cheat, then vote.
4.  Do not attack anyone with racial language.  (for:EUGENE)
--My rules for voting--
(This is fair, since you can only discuss about cheaters.)

Here's my example for vote.

---CHEATERs MANIFESTO---
(Vote YES to cheaters)


I believe that cheat is one of your(cheater's) right.  Even Blizzard 
said that you are allowed to cheat in B.net.  Some may say you are 
wrong, but you have a right to cheat.  The most people who comlplain 
about cheat are PKs.  Pkillers are getting mad these days, because 
they can't kill no more.  

There is no right or wrong for Pkilling.  Pkilling is just part of 
the game, even if you cheat to kill others it doesn't matter.  Only 
thing that people lose will be their ear.  Some say about moral 
behind the CHEAT, but I believe that moral of PKilling is just the 
same.  Final results are the same, &#34;You KILL, You Happy!&#34;  :) 
 There can't be a moral, remember Cheat to kill or not cheat to kill 
is the same.

DEFEND YOUR --RIGHT-- to CHEAT!!!  
Others being legit or non-legit is not your business, the people have 
right to chose their will.  You can't force them to do things that 
you want them to do.  Unite, and Down with our RIGHTS.
