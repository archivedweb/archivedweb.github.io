<pre>On Fri Jul 18 04:29, THE MAN CAUGHT.  PROOF FROM HIS OWN MOUTH! wrote:
&#62; Guess what folks.  I have actual proof The Man is a cheater, words 
&#62; from his own mouth.  I thank CARDINAL CURUNIR for his unknowning but 
&#62; important awaking of this evidence.  Now, this is how I came up with 
&#62; it.  On our PoC board, we started playing a little game.  It was 
&#62; called, end out posts with the lame comments that The Man has played. 
&#62;  Several PoC played, including Cardinal Curunir.  Well, he provided 
&#62; me the evidence from his quotes that caused me to check on it and 
&#62; secure evidence from the horses mouth that, well..HE IS A CHEATING 
&#62; BSER.  Now, here is the evidence.
&#62; 
&#62; On Mon July 14 at 15:04(pacific time I do believe) The Man posted in 
&#62; this very tavern:
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
&#62; I am not going to apologize to quitters.
&#62; 
&#62;               PoC, I am growing tired.
&#62; 
&#62;               Tracy, we can duel, arrange a time sometime Friday, I 
&#62; am busy the 
&#62;               rest of the week.  That is, if you don't chicken out. 
&#62; :)  I mean, you 
&#62;               are PoC...how good can you be?
&#62; 
&#62;               And, to PoC....
&#62; 
&#62;               NO offense, but I am angry at quitters who quit and 
&#62; then expect the 
&#62;               guild they left to be friendly.
&#62; 
&#62;               And, I am requesting to INFERNO to have you guys banned 
&#62; from the 
&#62;               channel.  Because of one person.
&#62; 
&#62;               Pyro forced Fusion to quit.  And Pyro?  I may duel 
&#62; you..when you get 
&#62;               good, and when you can talk without sounding like white 
&#62; trash in 
&#62;               every word you say.  
&#62; 
&#62;               So, I say this for PoC...
&#62; 
&#62;               You guys can act all tough and big, but I still see 
&#62; right through 
&#62;               you. You are all 13-17 year old kids trying to be big.
&#62; 
&#62;               So, PoC, you guys can stay out of INFERNO's way, 
&#62; period.  
&#62; 
&#62;               But, TO make decisions in INFERNO, so they are the ones 
&#62; to decide.
&#62; 
&#62;               And to the PoC who call me a pussy, I may have cared, 
&#62; but you guys 
&#62;               are just chopped liver also rans.  Shlonglor's 
&#62; Barbarians could beat 
&#62;               you guys.
&#62; 
&#62;               And Tracy?  Duel me on Friday. No ref.  If there is a 
&#62; ref, then just 
&#62;               forget about it.  That way, we can settle it between us.
&#62; 
&#62;               And to Elijah and the other ilk, you guys can TRY and 
&#62; get me in UO.  
&#62;               I just hope for your sakes I don't have some 
&#62; &#34;advantage,&#34; 
&#62;               like stones. :)
&#62; 
&#62;               Because this is not a threat to PoC.  Nor a Warning.
&#62; 
&#62;               This is a promise.
&#62; 
&#62;               You stay away from INFERNO, and get lost.  And if you 
&#62; do not....
&#62; 
&#62;               Then I may need to stop being as kind to you as I have 
&#62; been.
&#62; 
&#62;               And SnowRabbit?  When you officially stop being a 
&#62; coward and come 
&#62;               back, we can talk.
&#62; 
&#62;               And now, I am off to gain the last two million 
&#62; experience and become 
&#62;               level 50.
&#62; 
&#62;               See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.
&#62; 
&#62;               The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62;               P.S.  Flux?  Say one word about this....I dare 
&#62; you.&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&
&#62; #60;&#60;
&#62; 
&#62; The thing to remember what the man says here is &#34;And now, I am 
&#62; off to gain the last two million experience to become level 50&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62; NOW, this is what he posted on the PoC board, on Monday July 14 at 
&#62; 19:17 est.  Now, because of the difference between time zones, that 
&#62; is exactly ONE hour pretty much later.  Here is the post.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
&#62; Well, Quitters of Chaos, a few things. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Flux, we need to TALK. You are FAR from leader of INFERNO, 
&#62; and do not
&#62;          even begin to THINK you are. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Now then, for you, PoC. 
&#62; 
&#62;          If you gentlemen, and I use that term loosely, know what is 
&#62; good for you, forget
&#62;          about INFERNO and stay away from us. End of story. No 
&#62; alliances, no
&#62;          friendships, you are traitors...stay out. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Pyro? Interesting conversation with Flux today...very 
&#62; interesting stuff going on
&#62;          between you two. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Eugene? Get over yourself. 
&#62; 
&#62;          And Tracy....we duel on Friday. No ref. If you want one, and 
&#62; insist, then we
&#62;          don't fight. Those are the terms, if you want any others, 
&#62; email me. I doubt I will
&#62;          post on this forum again. Nice work on the page, I must say, 
&#62; Morte. Excellent
&#62;          forum. 
&#62; 
&#62;          And to those who doubt me, I do not care. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Now then, I am off to gain the last 750,000 exp until level 
&#62; 50. 
&#62; 
&#62;          Bye. 
&#62; 
&#62;          The Man (UO-INFERNO) 
&#62; 
&#62;          'What can I say? I'm a jerk..but NOT a quitter unlike a few 
&#62; special people.' 
&#62; 
&#62;          P.S. I am not Sexy-Rogue...I can guarentee that. Unlike her, 
&#62; I can be rational at
&#62;          times. 
&#62; :)&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;
&#62; 0;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;
&#62; 
&#62; Now, HERE the man says he is off to get the last 750,000 exp.  Ok, 
&#62; that means that in exactly ONE hour of time, The Man got 1.25 MILLION 
&#62; EXP.  Everyone remembers what The Man said below correct?  He said 
&#62; you get 10 exp from a monster, and that ONE HELL RUN gives you 10K of 
&#62; EXP.  HMMM, lets do the math shall we?  Ok, 1.25 million exp at 10 
&#62; exp per monster = 125,000 monsters killed in ONE HOUR.  Lets 
&#62; continue.  The Man said in one hell run levels 13-16 you get about 
&#62; 10K of exp.  Now that means that in order to get the needed 1.25 
&#62; million exp, the man made 125 Hell runs in ONE HOUR.  HAR, lets 
&#62; continue!!  With 125,000 thousand monsters killed in one hour, that 
&#62; means the man killed roughly 2073 monsters a minute, and 34 monsters 
&#62; a SECOND. HAR.  Now, we know for sure the man is lying cheating piece 
&#62; of crap.  However, we can even take this further yet.  Lets say for 
&#62; arguement sake that The Man was mistaken on his post on our board, 
&#62; and he still needed to get his 2 million EXP.  Ok, for 2 million exp 
&#62; the man would have to kill 200,000 monsters.  Lets say the man is a 
&#62; god, and he can kill a monster a second, so that makes 60 monsters a 
&#62; minute.  Now, divide 200,000 by 60 monsters and you get 3,333 
&#62; minutes.  Divide 3,333 by 60 for hours, and you get 55 hours of non 
&#62; stop play.  That would of taken the man 2.2 days of playing, and 
&#62; would equal 200 Hell runs from level 13-16.  Seeing how the man plays 
&#62; 8 hours a day, it should have taken him about 1 week.  1 week of 
&#62; killing a monser a second, 8 hours straight a day.  HAR HAR HAR.  
&#62; Now, we all KNOW it is impossible to kill a monster a second, let 
&#62; alone complete 200 hell runs in 2 or 3 days.  Anyway, The Mans post 
&#62; where he describes how much exp he needs are still on the PoC board 
&#62; and here on Ogden's.  I don't wanna go post the url to them cause I 
&#62; already pasted the entire things in this message.  I just wanted you 
&#62; all to see for yourself what a fool the man IS and always has been.  
&#62; The Man, you are a cheater, with evidence taken from your own BSED 
&#62; posts.  One thing about BSing liars, is at some point they get 
&#62; overwhelmed with their own lies, and caught, just like the man is 
&#62; right now.  Later.
&#62; 
&#62; Tracy Lords

The experience needed for Level 49 is 1,082,908,612 XP.
                            The experience needed for Level 50 is 
1,310,707,109 XP.

                            Therefore, the XP needed to go from Level 
49 to 50 is
                            227,798,497 XP (it's late and I just did 
that without a calculator,
                            so I may be off).  Being generous, let's 
say 225 million XP.

                            Assuming 10 XP/kill, achieving Level 50 
would require 22.5 
                            million kills.  Assuming 1 kill/second, 
this is 22.5 million seconds,
                            or 375,000 minutes, or 6250 hours, or 
approximately 260 days of
                            actual playing time (playing around the 
clock).

                            Assuming 10,000 XP per Hell/Hell run, and 
being generous and
                            estimating 1 hour per run, achieving 
Level 50 would require 
                            22,500 runs, or 22,500 hours, or 
approximately 168 days of actual 
                            playing time.

                            Using these assumptions, going from Level 
49 to 50 in only two
                            weeks appears unlikely.  Of course, the 
assumptions about
                            XP/kill or XP/run could be off by one or 
more orders of 
                            magnitude (I have no way of knowing until 
I reach level 48 or so
                            myself).  I receive approximately 1.2 to 
1.4 million XP per Hell/Hell
                            level now at Level 46.  If TheMan 
received 1 million XP per
                            Hell/Hell run, for example, achieving 
Level 50 would require only
                            225 runs.  Assuming 1 hr/run, this would 
require 225 hours, or
                            9 to 10 days of around-the-clock playing.</pre>
