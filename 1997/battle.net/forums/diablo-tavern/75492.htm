<pre>         hello,
   Well the forum is looking a bit rough lately and bnet is well, we 
all know how it is. Alot of folks are sort of new to this whole thing.
Others, well this is a reminder of how things have come so far.So, 
here is a little history, since I have been playing..and a little 
before.(this is kinda long....but i think you will like it..hope so)

     The first time I came to Ogdens was when I got the Diablo demo,
the original one, on a cd from a game magaizine. One of the big topics
of discussion was, of all things, the pentagrams in the game. Some 
people were offended by them and wanted them taken out. These same 
people had no problem chopping things into a bloody pulp though.
     I did not return to Ogdens for a while.
It was a bleak cold day,in early January, as BLZ_BOB lvl 1 warrior 
entered the realms of Battle.net. I asked all the newbie questions. 
    What are the bars by my name?
    How do i join a game?....etc. Dots, were a rare and wonderful 
thing then.
     I joined my first game and went adventuring. I had a blast!
I fought side by side with people I had never met. WE all got excited
by every blue lettered, and if you were lucky, yellow lettered thing 
we found. I had glorious armor back then..ac 12 + some &#37;.  Plate 
armor was an amazing thing. Anyone who had it, to me looked like a 
god. Something you could only dream of having. 
     Game names were simple. &#34;Goin to catz&#34; &#34;church&#34; 
and &#34;new guys here&#34;. I can't remember the last time I saw a 
game named Catz or Caves. I wonder I anyone plays there anymore?
     Well, I join my first catz game at level 13. Still in my plain 
looking armor and with my sword of power, and shield of structure(I 
guess the GAP wasn't selling swords yet..ehehe)..I had no rings or 
amulets. Anyway, me and two other hit those must catacombs. About 10 
minutes into it I killed a unique monster and heard a clink! 
WOW...splint mail!!!MAGICAL!!! I rushed to town as my two new friend 
typed their amazement. One had ring mail the other plain leather. 
Neither had seen Splint Mail. I was so excited. I ran to kain....MAIL 
OF THE WOLF. It gave me more hp...we all were jumping for joy. My AC 
grew to 46!  We played through the catz...I gained 3 levels! Well I 
flew back to the chat to tell of my new find. Many were amazed. It 
was great.
      Soon I found more stuff. Sword of speed...etc. WE would trade 
and buy stuff from each other. Gold meant alot. And trading was an 
art. My levels grew. Then one day i hit level 20.
      Nitemare level. I asked other 20+ levers what it was like. They 
all said...You will see....with a grin I could see though my monitor.
So got one other fellow to join me in the dreaded Nitemare Church.
Well at first it looked like the same old church as Normal level.
Then the monsters came. That skeleton that I could break in to pieces 
before, now restisted my blade. But, I kept at it. Then I saw the 
gold. It seemed to rain down from above. 200 pieces at a time!!!!
After one level I had over five thousand gold!!!!I never saw more 
thatn one pile of gold in my inventory before...this was great.
     Griswold started selling good stuff. All types of prefixes and
suffixes I had never seen before. I soon was heading into the catz 
alone ,as my AC rose to 56.
     Then I was given a gift. Two actually. I was playing in a normal 
catz game,maybe even stepping into the caves, and two higher level 
characters, upper 20's entered. They were clad in full plate and were 
going to hell. HELL!! I said..wowo!
  A while later one asked me to come to town he had somethings for me.
WOW..stuff from hell...where you could find the mythical Zodiac stuff.
What he gave me was BLESSED MAIL OF THE TIGER and BLESSED HELM OF THE 
WOLF. WOWOWOW...my AC broke 100 and I had at ton of hp. These guys 
were great. Then before they went down to hell for the last time they 
gave me one more thing. A ring. I had one ring now..ring of vitallity.
But they gave me a ring of stars. +10 to all. The best thing I had 
ever seen. Soon I saw that PLAYER HAD KILLED DIABLO AND LEFT THE GAME.
I thought..hey they actually killed diablo. WOW.
  Then one day, something strange began to happen. A level 29 guy 
joined my game. He asked me where I was. I said in the catz. You want 
a portal? He did. Well hey, I can use the help I thought. He came 
down. Then without any pretense..Chopped me to bits. I had been PKd.
Well, he left right away, and took my ear. At first I was confused.
I lay there on the dungeon floor, face down in my own blood, looking 
at a red screen. All I could think was. Damn, well I'll never do that 
again. I restarted and went to the chats.
    I related my story to my friend in good ol CHAT 5..no usa or 
whatever then..just chat 5....They all shared their pk expierinces
and we all swore to be smarter. Then someone asked if I read the 
forum. I said 'forum'? Then I remembered Ogdens Tavern. I made a 
quick trip to this mysterious place.
    When I got here what did I see? WOW...this game hade guilds. 
People were posting there characters lives day by day. It was a 
wonder ful place. Some guy named PEGLEGBOY from something called 
INFERNO..claimed they would kill us all...and some other guild called 
NOVA(anyone remember this?) waged flame wars back and forth. My first 
post on this forum was a flame to PEGLEGBOY.(heheh)
     Well I began to visit here more often as my levels grew and 
slowly Bnet changed.
     DUPING. Well it seemed there was a bug in the game that allowed 
you to duplicate items. I thought..this is cheating isnt it? Well
noone was going to force you into duping so I figured it would not 
affect me. I was wrong.
     One day someone joined a game I was in and asked who needed 
armor. Well my Blessed stuff was some fine stuff so I said I'm ok..
the other guy in my game needed better stuff. Boy did he get it.
GODLY PLATE OF THE AGES. WOW....atleast i got something out of it.
Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac. Damn what a nice ring.
     Soon I discovered it was a dupe. I hated it! Damn. I dumped it.
In truth it was a hard thing to do. It gave me my only resistances.
      Well, I soon was playing in hell. Had great plate(BLESSED) and 
shield and helm. Then with the help of a rouge named BATTLETHONG.
I killed Diablo!!!! My heart was pumping as I watched the end movie.
I cryed out &#34;YES!!!!&#34; I watched diablo crumble and then just 
freaked out when I saw what happens. Now I knew the sectet of the 
dots.&#60;hehe&#62;
      Well, soon I was into my 30's had all three dots with the help 
of friends and strangers. And well, started to get bored. I didn't 
have the best stuff. So I still looked for more. Then one day I 
decided to visit the INFERNO chat.......
       WOW...all the names I had seen on Ogdens posting about their 
kills. This was interesting. I thought what it would be like to do 
that. Kill someone. It had happened to me, and I didn't like. But hey 
Blizzard put that button there for a reason. I politely inquired about
how this was done. I actually got good advice. So I gave it a try.
       Well, the guy never saw it coming. We were playing then poof.
I killed him. I didn't even take his ear. I just looked at him. He 
left the game. I went back to the chat. Chat 5 . People could not 
believe what I did. I tried to explain. But most just said BAH!
Well my days of newbie helping was over. I was now a very bad boy.
      I didn't kill thousands or even hundreds, just folks that 
ticked me off usually. People with foul game names and such. Or 
people who tried to kill me. I started to linger in INFERNO more 
often. 
      THEN the cheaters came out of the wood work. 
     Townkill. I still hate that. Then autokill. Then the rumor of 
monsterkill...a program that could let you kill people and take there 
stuff..that one was a rumor. But, MK became a reality.
      In Ogdens I started to post. At first not even giving my name 
or email. The cheaters were an easy target to post against, trying to 
justify what they did.
       Well, the hacks soon followed and Blizzard made patches. Which 
as we all know were a bandaid on a gaping flesh wound.
        Though all that I had tons of fun. Tons.
    Well, I posted more and more here as people seemed to enjoy my
twisted little wit and replied with kind words. Battle.net was going 
into the can but the forum was still fun. Then that changed too.
    Half the post became &#34;get your cheats here!!!&#34; and such. 
The stories began to fade and many tried to save the sinking ship. 
People
doubled their efforts to make this place fun and interesting.

     Well this weekend the forum has a sleezy feel to it. I won't 
even get into it. Thanks to those of you who post the funny and 
intersting stuff..AND DONT STOP!&#60;thanx&#62;.
     Bnet. Well the INFERNO chat used to be so much fun. Now, well it 
rarely is the INFERNO chat other than in name. So, I seek solace 
elsewhere. Thanks to the somewhere else for letting me hang out.
     Anyway, to all those who have no idea what the it was like way 
back when, I hope this gave you a little glimpse into the past. To 
those who were, I hope this reminded you of how much fun it was then.
      SO, I still hang out and chat. And even play a bit. Ironman is 
alot of fun.&#60;just don't let the butcher out...eeheeh&#62;. and 
well I still hunt for unsuspection toursist in Tristram.
       Well, sorry this was so long. If you got this far. Thanx for
 your time. If anyone has any little things from the past to add,
 please do!
             -BLZ_BOB&#34;LLAMA KING&#34;
&#34;&#60;sigh&#62;...the good ol days&#34;</pre>
