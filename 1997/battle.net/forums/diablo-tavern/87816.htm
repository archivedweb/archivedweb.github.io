&#62; WHERE IS THAT SCUM DARKAND GLOOMYNAME! boomed a voice from above. A 
&#62; few townsmen scurried away in terror.
&#62; 
&#62; Oh no! I recognize that voice cringed YukYuk, Its Sir CheatsAlot 
&#62; and he is going to add our ears to his collection.
&#62; 
&#62; SEND ME A PORTAL! NOW! I AM GROWING IMPATIENT boomed Sir CheatsAlot.
&#62; 
&#62; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&#62; CHAPTER 3
&#62; 
&#62; Why should we send you a portal, when you will only come down and 
&#62; kill us? shouted Darkand up through the air shaft.
&#62; 
&#62; WELL PUNY MORTALS, I CAN ALWAYS JUST STAY HERE AND KILL YOU HERE IN 
&#62; TOWN OR STRIKE YOU DOWN FROM WHERE I STAND WITH MY AUTOKILL CHEAT!!! 
&#62; SEND THE PORTAL NOW!! SIR CHEATSALOT HAS SPOKEN!!
&#62; 
&#62; Doesnt look like we have much choice do we? asked Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; YukYuk nodded, and cast the portal spell. Within a  matter of moments 
&#62; a mage pushing a large wheelbarrow arrived.
&#62; 
&#62; NOW STRIP EVERYTHING OFF AND PLACE IT IN THIS WHEELBARROW, THEN SING 
&#62; A HYMN IN MY HONOR, AND THEN CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FACE THE WALL 
&#62; boomed Sir Cheatsalot.
&#62; 
&#62; Why do you use a wheelbarrow? asked Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; MY EGO OCCUPIES ALL MY SPACE IN INVENTORY replied Sir Cheatsalot.
&#62; 
&#62; What cheats do you have? asked Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; A whistfull expression lit up on Sir Cheatsalots face. TOWNKILL, 
&#62; GHOST, TOWNKILL, UNLIMITED BELT.....  
&#62; 
&#62; Do you have the Virus cheat yet? asked Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; VIRUS? demanded Sir Cheatsalot.
&#62; 
&#62; Yes its rather clever. When you turn it on, any object you lose to 
&#62; pk becomes a virus carrier and which reformats the hard drive of the 
&#62; killer. Its really good. I am running it now. Can you tell? Want to 
&#62; see it in action? Here let me show you, first I need to toggle my 
&#62; posture to...
&#62; 
&#62; *Sir_Cheatsalot (99) has left the game*
&#62; 
&#62; Quick thinking, Darkand said Yuk Yuk, I thought we were dead.
&#62; 
&#62; Yeah, well he lifted the idea from an Ogdens tavern post. Why just 
&#62; the other day I read the same thing there said the Narrator.
&#62; 
&#62; I did not. Really. Its original. Hey, whats that huge list you have 
&#62; there? asked Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; Oh, its just a survey of sorts. The latest rage at the tavern is to 
&#62; post huge surveys and see how much of the tavern wall you can cover 
&#62; with responses. My survey is a List of your top 10 favorite 
&#62; surveys, stated the Narrator. I hope to get at least 50 responses, 
&#62; and by sheer volume become the most acclaimed in the Tavern. From 
&#62; there I will repost it on another forum, and then another to roll on 
&#62; and on until....
&#62; 
&#62; Look, if you could pry yourself away from that metadrivel, could you 
&#62; narrate us out of this Mobius strip and into a decent plotline? 
&#62; asked Yuk Yuk.
&#62; 
&#62; There is no need to be snotty, huffed the Narrator in an injured 
&#62; tone.
&#62; 
&#62; *DeathMorteKillKill(5) has entered the game*
&#62; *Undertaker(4) has entered the game*
&#62; 
&#62; Where are you guys? Does this portal go down to you? asked 
&#62; Deathmorte.
&#62; 
&#62; Hey could you sent me a portal? asked Undertaker.
&#62; 
&#62; I have a bad feeling about these guys whispered Yuk Yuk.
&#62; 
&#62; Me too replied Darkand. Hey you guys arent killers are 
&#62; you?shouted Darkand.
&#62; 
&#62; Nah, we love cooperative games replied Deathmortekillkill.
&#62; 
&#62; Certainly not! shouted Undertaker.
&#62; 
&#62; As Darkand began to cast portal, the world slowed down  and stopped, 
&#62; then went black. 
&#62; 
&#62; Darkand: Where are we?
&#62; YukYuk: I dont know.
&#62; Narrator: Diablo Retail USA-9. Its a chat room of sorts, where you 
&#62; can meet everyone else.
