<pre>  Uh, could you please tell me which Inferno division this would be? 
The only Inferno division that does have a webpage up is Special 
Attacks, and I know there is nothing in there that has anything to do 
with cheats or cheating. The only thing I found there was an 
announcement that cheating is not allowed in Inferno. Get your facts 
straight man. You claim to be an adult, well, act like one. Act like 
you do have some intelligence in that little brain of yours. If you 
think you're a threat to us..... well, you're not. I don't know where 
you got this idea that Inferno is sending spies to you, maybe you're 
just paranoid. Inferno could care less for these &#34;Cheating to 
kill PK's Guilds&#34;. We just laugh at them.

&#34;Let he who has not cheated cast the first stone!&#34;

&#62; Well Puzzlebox, or whoever you are, you did prove one thing to the 
&#62; Order today. You are not worthy. You still don't see the point. It 
&#62; does not matter whether you cheat or not, many members of your guild 
&#62; do. I have fought them myself so I don't need heresay. Cheating isn't 
&#62; even the issue here. PKing is. And you are a guild of PKers. That is 
&#62; your crime. Face it, inferno has grown so large that you cannot 
&#62; control it. I could care less if you cheat or not, you PK innocent 
&#62; people, and the Order will not allow you to run unchecked. We may not 
&#62; be able to stop all of you, but we will try. I personally welcome a 
&#62; game without cheats, but i will not tell one of the Order's members 
&#62; not to protect themself. You are as thick headed as your inferno 
&#62; cohorts. Hell one of your silly little divisions has a web page up 
&#62; telling everyone how good cheating PKers they are. So you are a liar 
&#62; as well as a moron. One last thing. Pass this to your guild: Stop 
&#62; trying to infiltrate the Order, you won't succed. If you guys aren't 
&#62; worried about us, and we &#34;are not a threat&#34; why does your 
&#62; guild need to place spies...???
