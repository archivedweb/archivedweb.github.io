<blockquote>
<pre>I offer this re-post of a infamous KAIRAEGA message:

okay sexy rogue, claritin, whatever you call your lame loser licking 
a$$, and TGS, eugene, and all the tiny children that pop in, here 
comes the answers to ALL your questions....

the TRUE meaning of snakegod:

i joined this guild back when their were only what, 5 members 
including myself.we went unnoticed, and had so much fun i thought it 
was illegal, but now we have no less then 5 clan games running a 
night, and have members on constantly (usually in a game).
snakegod EXISTS FOR ONLY ONE REASON....FREINDSHIP.
we are freinds, and allow others in this crazy world to have a bunch 
of close freinds as well. thats the secret of life people..freinds. 
without freinds we get bitter and resentful, like sexy rogue and 
eugene, or we get very stupid and arrogant like the:godly:soul/mage
snakegod is a group of very close, very loving people that play 
diablo to socialize and interact in this vast virtual society we call 
B.net.
freindship...thats what snakegod is ALL about..NOTHING 
MORE&#62;&#62;&#62;PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!


2:salmissra

i met salmissra one day in late febuary..in the town square channel. 
i was laughing my butt off as she insulted a small group of channel 
spamming babies who could only respond by saying  &#34; you sux&#34;
i saw she was level 40, and my teacher sonikboom always told me, 
watch out for cheaters, anyone above 36..its impossible to 
reach....so i thought she was a cheat, and therefore tracked her 
account number,hoping to report her to clan excalibur (but 
excalibur..the cheat hunter guild, disbanded soon after)  salmissra 
played alongside me, and i saw she was NOT a cheat, she told me the 
trick to gaining such high levels, and i thanked her. for the next 
two days, i would run into her in the public channels, until she 
eventually told me to come to snakegod.salmissra is a woman....and if 
i were you, which thank god i aint, i'd show this fine young lady 
some respect....but then again, their aren't many REAL men left in 
the world, so why even bother talking about respect when NO ONE  
understands it anyways.


3:web site: almost done, its up, but only viewable by me, salmissra, 
and synergy cyber concepts..the single most powerful presence on the 
internet today.... (my shameless plug for SCC) the guy making it is 
my best freind in real life and is too bust getting screwed by his 
new girlfreind to be messing around with a page for now, so excuse 
him for living if it isnt done yet. (directed to the geeks, not 
fellow members or other honorable guilds)


4: storytelling:

guess what? im a REAL WRITER!!! thats right, in 2 years, my first 
published novel should be out. then you'll look back on the name 
kairaega and see who it is in my book and go, &#34;damn, so THATS 
what it was...&#34;  anyone who honestly wants a small peice of my 
book, dont hesitate to ask, i'm working on cutting up some small 
parts and making them available to some of my freinds.warning..its 
EXTREMLY graphic..he he he he he he he he he
the rest of snakegod does right too, as you can so plainly see, and 
they are just as good at it. you dont like the stories? shove it.


5:stance on cheating:
you cheat in snakegod, you are confronted, and MADE to stop...if you 
dont, YOUR OUT....no exceptions..we pride ourselfs on being TOTALLY 
clean. ill admit, in my first clan, and my second...AND my third, i 
took items that i now know as being dupes/hacks.but upon entering 
snakegod, i dropped them...not because they told me to, but because i 
WANTED to..they showed me so much, i felt it was time for me to show 
them something as well.....NO ONE in snakegod cheats....and if they 
do, then salmissra will deal with them PERSONALLY

6:SNAKEGOD IN ULTIMA ONLINE:

all of snakegod is going to ultima online....BUT...i and another 
member of snakegod who shall remain nameless have been drafted by 
ultima online's biggest and most feared evil guild. seems they know 
us and our skills..and want us to role play evil for them..i couldnt 
refuse, and neither could he.this guild is seriously 
powerful..already on the hit lists, and already getting respect from 
other guilds, good and evil alike. i WILL be in snakegod UO...but my 
question is...will i be in both guilds..at the same time????? thats a 
matter only i can solve....

7:PKING:

no one in snakegod pk's....at least no one i know.
however, my dueling charatcers, rydia strom and jued davanion have 
taken a few ears of some cheaters....and are curently recieving 
special training to join the saints...a pkilling guild i admire 
greatly. actually, my rogue has a to hit &#37; of 250, and she only 
has a dexterity of 61...she is already invincible to others around 
her level, and my warrior is the best damn legit warrior you can 
possible have..but im going on treasure hunts as kairaega looking for 
items for him. he already has a strange sword and a weird of 
haste.....lets just say, hes a god...and will be much more. ive 
already sent him into public games...with moderate success. until 
that level 22 warrior with 770 hp came by....eeewwwww..that was 
nasty. i just stood there and kept begging him to  &#34;strike me 
down with your cowardice&#34; boy did i piss him off!!!!!!!!!!!

there...i finnally have answered ALL your questions, if you have 
anymore..EMAIL ME..DONT POST THE QUESTIONS HERE.

thank you for your time...

-Kiaraega
my grandfather knows korean...he was a captain in the korean 
war...killed a helluva lot of koreans..he even knows korean.....he 
was able to translate some of the stuff, he says you cant spell.......
