&#62; Just a thought.  Duping is cheating, hacking is cheating, using duped

&#62; 
&#62; Recieving gifts for your low level character?  That is, someone of a 
&#62; higher level offers your low leveler say a Zod and some cool plate.
&#62; Now normally your low leveler wouldn't get his hands on that sort of 
&#62; stuff till at least the caves, but usually not till hell.  This 
&#62; equipment would allow a level one to breaze through both the Dungeons 
&#62; and the Cats,  nothing could touch him.
&#62; Also along those lines, passing equipment down from one of your own 
&#62; characters to a new character.  Cheating?
&#62; I know this is a pretty comon practice, so many of you will say no, 
&#62; its fair.  But think about it.  That low leveler would never have 
&#62; been able to get that stuff so quick.
&#62; 
&#62; Just food for thought.  And not very stimulating thought at that.

Well, I've thought this over for some time, and heres my conclusion:
When I make a character, I will specify (to my self) whether he will 
get hand-me-downs or not. I've got two guys accepting hand-me-downs 
and one mage not doing so.
  Heres a few things I'd like to throw out, food for thought as it 
were. First, it's tempting to say &#34;I found this, therefore its 
fine to give it to a newbie,&#34; but it does confer to the newbie 
more power than he should have, just like duping, and eliminates the 
early challenges of the game. On the other hand, what are we going to 
do with all the Blessed gothic plate of the stars and steel rings of 
the moon we find? They clearly aren't things that most high-level 
characters need, but they are good enough that one doesnt want to 
just toss them.

Another $0.02 for the pot.
