&#62; Well because of certian events this story has been takeing longer
&#62; than it should but in any case here's part one and the next should
&#62; be out no sooner than next week because I'm going away 4 a week to
&#62; the middle of noware(Not a computer for MILES!!).  BTW: Black Magic 
&#62; would repesent Cheating incase you don't get it and I should also 
&#62; mention this story is completely fictional and I tryed useing e-mails 
&#62; and conversations with the people I use as characters to really make 
&#62; this cool.  Hope you like.......
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Part One:  3am, Behind Ogdens Tavern
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Why? For what possible reason do you need me for.&#34;  The Man 
&#62; stood confused at why
&#62; anyone would possible attempt to take over INFERNO.  Yes there were 
&#62; many arguments
&#62; that had been pulling the guild apart for a time but to lead up 
&#62; against Tracy Lords for
&#62; control of INFERNO was just insane.
&#62; &#34;Because you have respect in INFERNO and people will follow you.  
&#62; If we can get you and a
&#62; couple others like Morte, and SnowRabbit there might be a chance 
&#62; others will follow.&#34;  The
&#62; short scrony man said with pride in his voice.
&#62; &#34;You'll never turn Snow Rabbit, shes to loyal to INFERNO.  
&#62; Listen, leading a revolt will
&#62; take a lot more then you me and Morte.&#34;  The Man stood there 
&#62; thinking how this could be 
&#62; accomplished, then he suddenly snapped back realizing how inane this 
&#62; conversation was.  Only it was to
&#62; late, The Man had already given all that Set  needed.  &#34;This is 
&#62; stupid, why would I want to  
&#62; try taking control of INFERNO, plus Tracy isn't the problem Eugene 
&#62; is.&#34;
&#62; &#34;Fine, if you don't want in then you don't want in as long a you 
&#62; remember that this
&#62; conversation never happened.&#34;  Set said covering his a*s.
&#62; &#34;Yea, yea what ever.  Best of luck to you, your going to need it 
&#62; with what your planing.  The Man wasnt one to let something like 
&#62; this go forgotten but he didnt think there was a chance that Set 
&#62; could do it.  And he was right, Set could never pull off taking over 
&#62; INFERNO but he wasnt alone.
&#62; 
&#62; The sword barely skinned his head, cutting of a small peice of flesh 
&#62; form PegLegBoys head.  Only the swipe wasnt ment to merle scalp 
&#62; him, but to separate his head from the rest of his body.  A idea 
&#62; PegLeg preferred did not happen.   With this swing the warrior had 
&#62; exposed himself as his arm was fully extended right above PegLegBoys 
&#62; sword, and with a quick reflection Peg had severed the mans arm.  
&#62; &#34;Arggg!!&#34;  He cried out in pain as his arm twitched on the 
&#62; floor, lying in a pool of crimson.  
&#62; &#34;You little,&#34; Peg spoke with a rage he had felt few times 
&#62; before.  He leaned down and picked up
&#62; the torn flesh that had once been apart of his head.  &#34;You dont 
&#62; deserve to die but I have no time to deal with you.&#34;  With that 
&#62; PegLeg slit the nameless warriors throat, and hastily cutting off his 
&#62; ear.  Now for the other one Peg thought to himself.  
&#62; 	PegLeg had left his position as leader, and founder of INFERNO quite 
&#62; some time ago and now had been residing quietly at his home just 
&#62; outside of Trenton.  Very few even knew of its existence, Tracy 
&#62; Lords, to which he left command of INFERNO to knew and another friend 
&#62; who had retired.  Only somehow these two warriors had found his home, 
&#62; and for some reason thought they could surprise PegLegBoy during the 
&#62; night in a attempt to kill him.  What fools.
&#62; 	PegLeg inched around the corners of his house, soundless.  Then from 
&#62; his bedroom where he had slayed the first one a creek was let out by 
&#62; the wooden floor.  With this Peg turned and ran down the hall back to 
&#62; his room, by the time he had reached it his window was open and the 
&#62; second man was gone.  
&#62; 	&#34;No your not.&#34;  Peg exclaimed as he jumped through the 
&#62; window just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear behind a group 
&#62; of trees.   Now Ive got you Peg though to himself, running at full 
&#62; velocity towards the trees.  When he reached the trees the man had 
&#62; gotten away again, but had caught his cloths on a tree branch leaving 
&#62; a clue to his identity.  Still Peg was upset that he had let this 
&#62; fellow get away, he felt that maybe he needed to get back in shape or 
&#62; even come out of retirement for a while.  The pain from his wound had 
&#62; just began to really set in and Peg turned to go back inside.  He got 
&#62; very little sleep that night for all he could think was that had to 
&#62; find out who had tried to kill him, and take revenge.
&#62; 
&#62; 	&#34;Cronos not like you!&#34;  Ogdens was filled with a more then 
&#62; usual element of filth that night, or early morning what ever you 
&#62; wish to call it.  In a corner sat Cronos, a tall rather good looking 
&#62; she though blond.  Cronos spoke in incomplete sentences, and never 
&#62; made much sense most of the time but those who knew him best had long 
&#62; since realized it never slowed her down in battle.  Next to her sat 
&#62; Sniper a well build, middle aged man that looked up to INFERNO with 
&#62; almost childlike envy, and lastly sat the three SnakeGod members that 
&#62; sat across the table and had just lost at poker.
&#62; 	&#34;You cheated, INFERNO always cheats.&#34;  ---- yelled as he 
&#62; stood leaning across the table as if to pick a fight.
&#62; 	Cronos just sat there a moment and then responded with, &#34;If we 
&#62; cheat why play poker with us?&#34;
&#62; 	Again there was a moment of silence as the group thought it over, 
&#62; and then frustrated that Cronos not only beat him in poker but the 
&#62; argument ---- reached across the table and slapped her, open hand.  
&#62; Sniper jumped to his feet drawing his sword which provoked all eyes 
&#62; in the bar to turn at the corner which the five had been playing 
&#62; poker.  
&#62; 	&#34;It ok Sniper.&#34;  Cronos said as she stood, &#34;they are 
&#62; right we will leave.&#34;  Cronos turned to leave and took one step 
&#62; before snapping back around to deliver a rather powerful blast to ----
&#62;  chest, not only knocking the wind out of him be sending him flying 
&#62; back against the wall.  This sent the bar into a state of chaos, 
&#62; Sniper dropped his sword and jumped across the table arms extended 
&#62; outward so that he would hit both SnakeGod members.
&#62; 	Hordes of people came running in the bars entrance to join the brawl 
&#62; as all Ogden could do was watch and think of what he could buy with 
&#62; the money in damages he would get from INFERNO.  The guild may have 
&#62; been made up of back stabers, and killers but they treated Ogden well 
&#62; and he would be compensated for the expenses.  With this crowd of 
&#62; people was the only two that really mattered, The Man, and Set.  
&#62; 	During the battle it was so chaotic that you barely knew who was 
&#62; fighting who, and this was Sets chance.  He moved to a quiet spot 
&#62; underneath the bar and pulled out his dagger from a hidden sheath 
&#62; under his cloths.  Then Set scanned the for his target, bingo.  He 
&#62; stood and weaseled his way through the bar, then grabbing onto his 
&#62; targets shirt he cut a small piece and left.
&#62; 
&#62; 	&#34;What do you mean Old School tactics?&#34;  Peg was utterly 
&#62; confused with Acidic Overdoses response to his plan for killing the 
&#62; Mage that they had tricked into following them to the Caves outside 
&#62; Trenton.   	
&#62; 	&#34;I mean thats the old way to assassinate.  What we need to do 
&#62; is argue over if you black magic because your hit points are so high, 
&#62; then Ill get him into thinking your out to get him and tell him that 
&#62; Im going to try and take kill you.  This way he trusts me.&#34;  
&#62; Acidic explained acting a little cocky.
&#62; 	&#34;And you dont think we used to pull that kinda stuff, man shut 
&#62; up about your old school and well use your plan.&#34;  PegLeg 
&#62; spoke trying not to laugh.
&#62; 	&#34;So when you going to come back to INFERNO Peg?&#34;  Acidic 
&#62; asked off the subject.
&#62; 	&#34;I dont know.&#34;  Peg said, because he truly did not know, 
&#62; &#34;if Im going to come back at all.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Ok, lets start Peg.  Oh, and remind me to ask you what happened 
&#62; to your skull later.  Thats a pretty good scar off the top of your 
&#62; head.&#34;  Acidic said falling back a little so to stand next to the 
&#62; mage who had been walking behind them.
&#62; 	&#34;Why you are pretty buff for someone who just started working 
&#62; out two weeks ago Kermit.&#34;  Acidic asked Peg in a elevated voice 
&#62; using his fake name that the two had chosen before going out.
&#62; 	&#34;Do you use black magic?&#34;  The mage asked.
&#62; 	&#34;No, of course not.  Its just that I have a magical cap, and no 
&#62; it doesnt use black magic.&#34;
&#62; 	Acidic turned his head to face the Mage and then whispered, &#34;I 
&#62; dont trust him, I say we take him now before he trys to kill 
&#62; us.&#34;  
&#62; 	The Mage turned to Acidic and spoke with out trying to conseale his 
&#62; words from PegLeg at the slightest, &#34;You want to back stab 
&#62; Kermit!&#34;  With this the mage took a step back turning his back to 
&#62; PegLeg, or Kermit as he knew him, so that he could face Acidic. 
&#62; 	&#34;Big mistake!&#34;  PegLegBoy exclaimed as he ran his sword 
&#62; through the mages back.  The silver colored metal just bearly peeked 
&#62; through his stomach sending blood flying onto Acidics loosely warn 
&#62; shirt.
&#62; 	&#34;Ah, man Peg!  Now I have to wash my shirt again.&#34;  Acidic 
&#62; said as the mage collapsed before him onto the floor.  Then Acidic 
&#62; jumped back saying, &#34;hey dont you dare bleed on my new boots 
&#62; dead man!&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; 	&#34;Hey guys whats this?&#34;  Tracy Lords asked looking at a note 
&#62; tacked up to Ogden taverns message board.  All most all of INFERNOs 
&#62; active members had showed up to help clean up their mess at Ogdens 
&#62; and Tracy had taken a break to read all the posts on the board for 
&#62; the day.
&#62; 	&#34;Whats the Problem Trace?&#34;  Snow Rabbit asked with a smile 
&#62; walking over to the message board where Tracy was standing.
&#62; 	&#34;Well it looks like a post from PegLeg saying that there is to 
&#62; be a INFERNO meeting at his cabin just outside of town tonight at 
&#62; sundown.  Could this be real?&#34;  Tracy looked up to Snow Rabbit 
&#62; with a questioning face.
&#62; 	&#34;PegLeg has a cabin?&#34; 
&#62; 
&#62; 	The tip of the sun was just sticking over the horizon so that the 
&#62; sky was lit up in a bright orange.  A group had gathered out side 
&#62; PegLegs home all discussing what this meeting could be about.  
&#62; Almost all of INFERNO had showed up, and Peg was very surprised to 
&#62; all have them on his porch when he awoke from his slumber he had 
&#62; taken after he and Acidic Overdose had finished their little ear 
&#62; collection outing.
&#62; 	As Peg opened his front do with confusion he whispered to himself, 
&#62; &#34;By the secret of the cows what is this?&#34;
&#62; 	James Hertfeild noticing PegLeg was now joining their ranks out in 
&#62; the open field he pointed to him tapping on Flux Babe on the 
&#62; shoulder.  Flux turned and spoke to Peg surprised at his rather out 
&#62; of shape figure.  She always had a thing for PegLeg and she didnt 
&#62; want to see him like this, in anycase she forced herself to look at 
&#62; him and speak.  &#34;Peg why have you called us here,  what has 
&#62; happened?&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Called you here?  What are you talking about, where is 
&#62; Tracy?&#34;  After a moment of scanning the group of forty or so and 
&#62; noted for his good eye site he noticed that The Man had a slight tear 
&#62; off the end of his shirt.
&#62; 	&#34;The Man where did you get that tear off your shirt!&#34;  Peg 
&#62; commanded.
&#62; 	&#34;Huh?&#34;  He answered.
&#62; 	&#34;The tear on the end of your shirt, where did you get it?&#34;  
&#62; He restated his question. 
&#62; 	Looking down at the tear The Man said, &#34;I dont know maybe in 
&#62; the brawl at Ogdens.&#34;
&#62; 	Peg not moving his eyes off of the tear marched through the crowed 
&#62; right up to The Man and felt the material of his shirt.  &#34;You 
&#62; tried to kill me.&#34;  Peg said eyes wide open.  &#34;You..&#34;  
&#62; He had trusted The Man and never thought that anyone in INFERNO would 
&#62; ever try to betray him.  
&#62; After a moment of absolute silence a lone voice spoke in shock, 
&#62; &#34;Holy Sh*t, KoR!&#34;
&#62; All eyes turned from The Man to a hill off in the easts now barely 
&#62; lit skyline.  There stood a good hundred and fifty warriors, rogues, 
&#62; and wizards all fitted for battle.  &#34;It was a trap, you lead us 
&#62; into a trap.&#34;  Peg murmured quietly to The Man as he stood there 
&#62; with out a word of defense for what could he say, and if he did 
&#62; defend him self would anyone listen?  Either way it wasnt the time 
&#62; for this matter now all of the INFERNO could concentrate on was 
&#62; staying alive.
&#62;

&#62; &#34;If this was 'Driveing Miss Dasiy' I'd be honking&#34;
