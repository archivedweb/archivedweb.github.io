<blockquote>
<pre>I don't know how long I was out, but when consiosness returned to me, 
I was inside a tent, laying on a makeshift cot.  I tried to sit up, 
but a shock of pain tore through my body, and I decided against it.  
I was in a room with at least ten others, most of whom were laying on 
similar beds.  A lone figure was tending to the wounded, a tall 
slender mage.  He noticed that I was awake and came over and knelt 
beside my cot.

&#34;Rest my friend.  Your injury is quite severe.&#34;  His voice 
was low and calm.  &#34;I am known as Wiseman, please rest for a 
while.&#34;  He played the part of a compassionate healer well, as if 
it was what he truly was.  He placed one of his hands on my broken 
breastplate and chanted strange words.  His hand glowed a soft white 
for a moment, and the pain seemed to subside a bit.

I managed to smile for a moment before the pain that stayed sent a 
jolt of agony through my body.  I looked up at the stranger.  
&#34;Thank you.&#34;  I was about to close my eyes and try to sleep 
when a warrior, clad in glimmering silver plate barreled into the 
tent.

&#34;Baal has appeared on the battlefield!&#34;  He was a bit out of 
breath, his sword and shield slung over his back.

Wiseman looked at the knight and stood up.  &#34;You are certain?&#34;

&#34;Well, I didn't go and ask him personally, but when you see a 
twenty foot tall skeletal nightmare standing on the other side of 
your lines summoning undead creatures from the ground itself, you get 
a pretty good idea.&#34;  The knight was being a bit sarcastic.

&#34;Very well.&#34;  Wiseman said calmly as he walked towards the 
exit.  Before leaving, he turned around.  &#34;I will be back in a 
moment, please rest.&#34;  He and the knight disappeared from view.  
I glanced around the room, trying to see if Kal was among those 
resting, but I could not see him.  It was either foolishness or 
something else that drove me to stand up, which was a painful 
experience, I assure you of that.  I managed to stagger to the exit 
of the tent and out into the cool breeze of the night, one hand on my 
shattered chest.  The night sky was illuminated by the arcane magic 
that was being used by each side, on each side.

As I limped closer to the battlefield, I began feeling the earth 
below me tremble, just a bit.I stopped for a moment and turned 
around.  I found myself face-to-face with a rather large, pale yellow 
dragon.  With the pain I felt, I had little energy left to be 
surprised.

&#34;Hello little one.&#34;  Its voice was soft and gentle as a 
mother's voice.

I looked up an winced in pain before being able to smile.  
&#34;Hello.&#34;

&#34;You seem to be in a lot of pain, little one.  May I help?&#34;  
Although I knew it was a dragon, it was not one like K'tana.  It was 
a lot smaller, or so it seemed, and its scales were dull and pale, 
unlike K'tana's majestic looking purple coat.

&#34;That would be...&#34;  Another jolt of pain ripped through my 
body, stopping me mid-sentence.  &#34;...nice.&#34;

The strange dragon reached out with one of its massive claws and 
barely touched my chest.  Its claw glowed bright blue for a moment 
and then the light faded.  The moment the light began dimming, the 
pain began lessening in intensity.  I looked up at the dragon before 
me, my wound healed completely.  &#34;Who are you?&#34;

The dragon pulled its head back and looked at me cock-eyed for a 
moment and then smiled.  &#34;I am K'thar, a healer, and you are 
Suzanne, a Deamon in the service of K'tana.&#34;

&#34;You are a...&#34;

&#34;Female?  Yes, but we are not like you humans.  Our gender is 
related to our caste, and little else.&#34;

&#34;Oh...&#34;  I looked over towards the battefield and saw what 
the knight that barged into the tent was talking about.  Despite 
being at least a league away, a lone beast stood out - a towering 
nightmare of bone cast in an unearthly red glow.

&#34;Do not worry, little one, although we cannot interfere directly, 
there are many ways left to us.&#34;  K'thar spoke softly as she 
walked up beside me and looked out to the battle.  &#34;Stay here, 
and watch.&#34;  She continued towards the batte lines.

I heard a familiar grumbling coming from behind me and looked back, 
it was Kal.  He was hobbling along with his staff doing most of the 
work.  He smiled when he saw me look at him.  I think we were both 
relieved to know that we were still alive, despite what had happened 
the next day.  He staggered up beside me and kissed my forehead.

&#34;Glad to see you are awake.&#34;  He was weary, but not from a 
lack of rest.  &#34;I just managed to crawl out of a cot a few 
minutes ago and though I'd go look for you.&#34;

I wrapped one arm around his waist and rested my head on his 
shoulder.  His arm found its way around my shoulder and we stared off 
into the battle for a few moments.  K'thar had stopped a few hundred 
paces from the rampart and appeared to be waiting.

&#34;The dragon there is K'thar.  She has something planned for Baal, 
but I don't know what it is.&#34;  I whispered.  It was good to be 
near Kal again, even for just a few moments.  I learned long ago that 
each moment is a treasure in its own right.

&#34;She?&#34;  He asked curiously.

&#34;Yes, she didn't really explain much about it other than it had 
something to do with the caste she belongs to.&#34;

&#34;She isn't alone anymore.&#34;  Kal said, pointing his staff 
towards the sky.  A trio of bright red dragons shot from the sky 
towards her like lightning.  The three split up and opened their 
wings a few moments before they would have hit the ground.  As if it 
were some form of eloquent dance, the three twisted and turned just 
above K'thar then landed softly around her; one to the left; one to 
the right; and one behind her.  She looked back at me for a moment 
and as she turned back towards the battle, she opened her mouth, as 
if to roar.

It wasn't what I expected - it was like a voice of an angel; a poor 
description, I admit, but a very fitting one.  Her angelic voice, 
singing a strangely enchanting song, filled the valley.  The cool 
mountain breeze seemed to calm to barely a whisper, as if it was 
bowing out for the dragon's song to be heard clearly.  The other 
three joined in, their deep voices filling the few pockets of empty 
air with their strange song.  The words, although their meanings were 
unknown to me, I seemed to understand what they sang about, but I 
cannot put it into words.  Kal seemed closer to me than ever before, 
as if were indeed one, as did the grass beneath us, the air around us 
- it was like we simple were.

I didn't notice at first, as I was captivated by the engimatic hymn, 
but the ground beneath the four dragons began to shimmer with a pale 
green light.  As they continued to fill the valley with their melodic 
poem, the shimmering light grew, slowly engulfing everything around 
us.  As the glow washed over Kal and I, some things seemed to slow to 
a crawl, while others continued at their normal pace.  Whatever the 
four dragons were doing, it was helping our forces.  The undead 
creations appeared to be the only things slowed to a crawl, while the 
Watchers, Deamons, and other mortals were moving normally.

&#34;You think your song can stop me?&#34;  Baal's voice echoed 
through the valley, marring the dragons' melody for just a moment.

A shadow appeared far above the battlefield, and circled above Baal's 
position for a few moments before dropping like a stone.  K'tana 
raised his massive wings, blocking our view of Baal, and landed right 
in front of the unholy beast.  The guardian dragon's body was bathed 
in a pale blue light - the same blue light that I saw him use on 
Diablo.

&#34;No, but I can.&#34;  K'tana boomed back at Baal, oddly enough, 
his voice did not disturb the mysterious tune that the other four 
dragons wove.  He brought a claw up and was preparing to strike the 
prime evil, but stopped mid-motion.  The blue light faded to 
nothingness, and he bowed his head and turned back towards our lines -
 Baal had fled to safety, wherever that may be.  K'tana took to the 
air and disappeared into the night sky.  

The other four dragons, knowing that their opportunity had passed, 
slowly stopped their song, one at a time.  At first, it was one of 
the red dragons, then another, then the last red dragon.  K'thar 
bowed her head as she began the end of the song; the pale green light 
that bathed the landscape faded to nothing, and time seemed to adjust 
itself back to normal.  She looked up into the sky and let out a cry 
that echoed through my soul, as if she was crying for all those she 
could not help or heal.  The mountain winds that had died down for a 
while returned, my long bloodstained hair danced with it.  K'thar 
curled up on the ground, and rested her head on top of her claws.  
One of the red dragons beside her placed its claw on her, and in a 
flash of light, the two disappeared.

I looked up at Kal.  &#34;I think its time we got ready to go.&#34;

He nodded.  &#34;I think so.  One of the Deamons I spoke with earlier 
said that she had some armor you could use, as I'm sure that 
breastplate is of little good now.&#34;

I looked down and examined my amor for the first time with a clear 
head.  It was damaged beyond repair, the maul that struck me had 
cracked it in many places - not even a blacksmith of Griswold's skill 
could fix it.  &#34;You are quite right, Storm.  Do you know where 
Rat is?&#34;

&#34;Yes, she is resting in the tent over there, I managed to find 
her before I found you.  That shield we gave her is ruined, but one 
of the Watchers replaced it while she slept with a large kite 
shield.  She should be awake in a few cycles.  They told me she 
fought like one of them in the battlefield, they were rather surpised 
that a young girl could fight as well as she did.&#34;

&#34;I think Retribution has something to do with that, but none the 
less, I don't know if I'd be here if we left her back in Nestor.&#34;

Kal took his arm off my shoulder and took a step towards the 
battlefield.  &#34;I heard that.  Please try to be a bit more 
careful.&#34;

&#34;I will.&#34;  That was his way of saying he cared.  He never 
said anything directly about how he felt, but I knew what he ment.

Kal turned around and smiled.  &#34;Good.  The Deamon's camp is just 
over there.&#34;  He pointed westward, towards a small group of light 
brown tents.  &#34;We can get you suited up, and then I guess we'll 
have to find our way towards the mountain that undead mage told us 
about.&#34;

&#34;You go get Tasha, I'll meet you two back here, I shouldn't be 
too long.&#34;  I started walking towards the brown tents Kal had 
pointed out, but stopped before I got too far away.  &#34;I forgot to 
ask, do you know who came into the battle last night?  I remember 
hearing the name Ordo Rosae Moriatur, but I never heard who else 
joined in.&#34;

Kal turned around, as he too had begun walking away.  &#34;Well, from 
what I have heard, there are four clans here; Snakegod, Tarot, Ordo 
Rosae Moriatur, and one called Arch-Angels Force.  The last one has a 
rather strange name, given that they are made up of mortal men, but 
they fight well and have swelled the ranks of those opposing Baal 
quite a bit.  Anyone standing against Baal I would consider a friend 
of mine.&#34;

&#34;Thanks, I'll be back here in a few cycles.&#34;  I returned to 
my trek towards the Deamon's encampment.  It felt strange walking 
into a place where I would be among unmet comerades.  Maybe I would 
recognize someone.

&#34;When you born, you must choose to be either a god or man.  
Choose wisely, for neither have forgiven each other.&#34;

I know this one took a while, but alas, I was busy :)

Stonehaven, Wiseman, and Morteleux - I'm saving the lives of 
defenseless electrons by saying this in one line rather than three - 
impressive works I have seen from all of you over the past few days.  
I rarely reply to them as I am either at work (and can't post) or I'm 
in a mad rush, but have enough time to read them :)  Please don't 
stop...

Shameless plug for an impressive page, and then one for my own ;)
