<pre>Hiya Mad!

  I'm glad to see someone else here can pick a nicely aged song to
parody!  For some reason the tune came back much eaiser today, and
I was singing along in my cubicle.  Luckily I get here early enough
that I'm not bothering anyone who is sane!  Hehehe..

  That's a tough song to put words to, you did a great job.  I 
still think we should put out a tape... Snakegod tunes of Diablo!

  Also glad to see you're getting back in fighting shape.  You know, 
we don't like to see anyone have a misfortune, but we sure do like
to help people out.  Thanks for being there when we needed to help!
;^)

  I was almost the next customer for the Salvation Armory.  I decided
that as a level 43 I should be able to solo hell/hell.  In addition
to this astounding cockiness, I didn't have the sense to use a 
clan game to try it, IPX.  Well, you can probably guess that it
didn't go too well.  I ended up over my head with Steel Lords
and Azure Vipers, and aaarrrrggghhhhhhh!  Tinkle, clang, ping..ping
...ping..   Yep all over that horde of nasties.  I had also never
rebuilt any backups after losing them to the Lag Demon, so I needed
to play naked mage to get my stuff back.  Let me tell you, naked
mage in hell/hell is tough for a warrior!  I made a few interesting
discoveries I'm going to pass on to Rincewind, but after about an
hour of cast/quaff cast/quaff run... die start again... I got my
stuff back.  Then just to preserve my self respect, I finished 
clearing the level.  Next level down was Soul Burners and puppies,
so I took my preciously recovered equipment and called it a night!
Momma Barbarian didn't raise any completely stupid sons!

  Anyway, congrats on hauling yourself up by yer bootstraps.  Hope
to meet you in a game sometime... Or perhaps just tease Ransyn in 
chat!  

Seeya... Nice Parody!

&#34;Someday I'm going to take the time to solo hell/hell.  There 
should
 be special color dots for doing it that way!&#34;</pre>
