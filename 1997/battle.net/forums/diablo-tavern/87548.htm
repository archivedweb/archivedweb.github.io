<blockquote>
<pre>I originally posted this message under the name Ghost:

&#62;I have been playing Diablo on and off for several months on 
Battle &#62;Net. I think it is the single most interesting on-line 
game to come out &#62;in a long time. Not so much for the graphics 
and gameplay, which are &#62;quite good, but for its most fascinating 
aspect, the cheating. &#62;Cheating in Diablo has become a true arms 
race where weapons &#62;(hacks) and counter-weapons (anti-hacks) are 
created seemingly &#62;every week. First came the trainers and 
duping, then townkill, then &#62;autokill, then ghosts, now anti-
ghosts, and let’s not forget all the &#62;patches from Blizzard. How 
many man hours do you suppose have &#62;been spent on creating these 
cheats and anti-cheats? A hundred, a &#62;thousand, more? The game 
and its accompanying cheats when &#62;viewed as a whole are like some 
living organism, actually evolving as &#62;you watch. In the 
interests of continuing this grand experiment, I &#62;think we all 
should redouble our efforts and create many more new &#62;and 
interesting cheats. Also, we need to think of new and interesting 
&#62;ways of using the ones we have. In the race to create invincible 
&#62;characters perhaps we have overlooked the possibility that we 
might &#62;affect other aspects of the game such as the monsters or 
the &#62;scenery. I offer the following suggestions:

And many more cheat did arrive....

&#62;Suggestions for the current cheats:
&#62;
&#62;Invincibility (a.k.a. God Mode):
&#62;Stand in a doorway to a room and stay put so a players can’t get 
out. &#62;Claim that you are stuck.

I admit this is quite boring, but it is pretty annoying if done at 
the right moment.

&#62;Duping:
&#62;Most people just give stuff away. Too simple. Try this. Using 
the &#62;teleport spell., dump a number of huge piles of gold or high 
level &#62;treasure items around without killing any monsters. You 
know, in &#62;those rooms that have several piles of gold just laying 
there. Can’t &#62;you just hear them exclaiming to their friends: 
&#34;Whoa! Cool! Like I &#62;found 23,834 gold pieces and this here 
Vampire Sword on level 2 the &#62;other day. No really, I swear.&#34;

Tricky to pull off, I did do it successfully in 2.03 a couple times. 
I also have heard of others doing it Did they read my original post? 
Wish I knew.

&#62;The Ghost:
&#62;Being a Ghost in Diablo offers a player many possibilities to 
create &#62;mayhem. The obvious ones are snatching items and outright 
player &#62;killing, but there are many many more devious and subtle 
tricks at &#62;your disposal. For example, you might try some of the 
following:
&#62;1. Let monsters like the Butcher out at inopportune moments 

This had worked for me and countless others. Great fun along with the 
good ole &#34;portal in the Butcher's room&#34; trick. And of course, 
the &#34;portal to Hell&#34; trick.

&#62;2. Attack a player at the same time the monsters do, he might 
not &#62;figure out there is a ghost

I never did this subtly enough. You would need to tune your 
characters damamge to a believable level. A one chop death is a dead 
givaway. &#60;pun intended&#62;

&#62;3. Attack a player at the same moment that he meets a new guy. 
He &#62;will probably think the new guy killed him.

You would be surprised at how often this worked.

&#62;4. When he opens a chest drop a huge pile of gold or some super 
&#62;item. See Duping above.

Tricky to pull off, I did do it successfully in patch 1.03 a couple 
times. I also have heard of others doing the same or suspecting that 
it has been done to them. It is worth noting that since no attack is 
neccessary, this can still be done today. Ghost mode is available for 
the 1.04 patch, but if it is active you cannot do damage to other 
players. Additionally, with an item hacking utility you can probably 
switch items back to an unidentified status. Hee Hee.

&#62;5. Use area spells like Armageddon to kill all the monsters 
before the &#62;players can get to them.

Oddly, few players seemed to care about this, even when you do it for 
10 minutes or more. I don't think they realize that they are not 
getting experience.
.
&#62;6. Keep closing the doors behind players in an attempt to pen 
them &#62;inside of rooms.

It was funny to watch those who were unaware of ghosts just stop and 
stare at the door as you rapidly opened and closed it.

&#62;7. Here’s a thought, use a strait man. Have a friend play in the 
game &#62;as a visible player and then for newbies he can make up 
bogus &#62;explanations for all the ghostly occurrences. &#34;It must 
be those new &#62;invisible monsters that blizzard put in with last 
patch, right?&#34;
&#62;

Never did this, but I have heard of people using 2 computers so that 
they could be in the same game as 2 characters in order to trick 
people into a portal to Hell.

Here are some suggestions I had made for cheats. Some came true some 
didn't.

&#62;Suggestions for new cheats and hacks:
&#62;The hack experts out there need to move their focus off of just 
&#62;creating super characters. Create excitement. Consider the 
following:
&#62;
&#62;1. Make monsters become invisible, invincible, or both.

An Invisible monsters hack did come out, but the monsters were only 
invisible to you. Oh well...

&#62;2. Make players look like monsters. I would love to walk around 
&#62;looking like the Butcher.

We got the Golem Morph hack. Not really as good. What I really want 
is for the other players to see me as Diablo or a skeleton. You know, 
just lurk on the level and give em a big surprise.

&#62;3. Cause monsters to be duplicated/spawned or changed. Think of 
&#62;it, dozens of Butchers on level 2.

There is a hack to change the monsters that show up on a level. Never 
tried it myself. I am not sure if it works in multi-player.

&#62;4. Make something that can effect the dungeon walls, chests, 
stairs, &#62;graphics, etc.

Never happened.

&#62;5. Something to affect other players statistics. You would want 
to do &#62;this just as they enter a level or touch a shrine. 
&#34;Hey!, my Dexterity &#62;just dropped to 3.&#34; Ouch!

Hey, get with it hackers. This could be bigger than the Crash Code. 
Isn't there a shrine effect that raises one of your own stats and 
lowers all the other player's stats. If this could be linked to the 
Heal Other spell....Well, just a thought.

&#62;And now for my final suggestion
&#62; I hesitate even to write of it. It represents the true doomsday 
device &#62;of cheats. I wouldn’t want to give anyone any ideas or 
anything, but &#62;consider this. Many of the current cheats can 
create odd and &#62;unstable side effects. In light of this, it seems 
like it would be very &#62;possible to create a hack that would crash 
a whole game and/or &#62;kick everyone out of a given map. One could 
quickly bring down a &#62;great number of games doing this. Just a 
thought...

Remeber, I wrote this before the Crash Code came out. I have always 
wondered if the creator of Crash Code got the idea from my post.

&#34;Those were the good ole days...Those were the good ole 
days...&#34;
