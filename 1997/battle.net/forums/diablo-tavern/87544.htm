<pre>First off, 
I wish you luck with the Tarot thing.  That is an interesting twist, 
we can still be friends if you end up hunting me can;t we? hehehe Not 
that I want to risk that arrow in my back.... how many weird shrines 
did you sat you had hit? :)



&#62; OK, now for something completely different! 
&#62; 
&#62;  -=|)elfontes=-. What the heck is up with this |)el, petitioning PoC? 
&#62; I hear they are all legit and PK like mad. Well, this does sound 
&#62; interesting, at least I know there will be some PK's out there not 
&#62; using GM I can go after. And I know Delfontes PK's, but I thought he 
&#62; went after cheaters only. Whats up bud? Give me a shout and let me 
&#62; know.


Well, 
           I didn't mention PoC in my post, but I guess everyone 
assumed that. Maybe it is because it is the only PK guild that is 
growing at all, or that looks cool.  I stopped by their web page, and 
I realised that I knew practically everyone that was a founder of the 
guild.
            So, basically, I miss random killing.  It really kept the 
game fun a few months back.  I want to hunt again.   I know that I 
have only been killing cheaters for soo long now, but the business 
has gotten too hazardous.
           I always love the feel of killing a cheater, but my ratio 
of kills to lying on the floor is like 1 for 5.  Maybe if i choose 
more random targets, the ratio might go back up some.  It also would 
be nice to have partners in crime. Hhehe.
           Here is a link to Morte's page on the guild, check it out:
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/1117/">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/1117/</a>
           Hope you don't mind the plug :)
           Anyhow, I read all about it, and I like it!
           Look for new stories, perhaps a bit darker... but just as 
fun to write.  Well, hope that answers your question., See you online 
;)

P.S.  I am not yet affiliated with PoC, I haven't been accepted.  
They need 75&#37; to vote me in... So this all might be for nothing.
