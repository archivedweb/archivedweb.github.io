&#62; This was posted on LaWizards Chatzone by a person named SF. I found 
&#62; it very interesting. Maybe you will too.
&#62; 

&#62; 80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.

  Not me.

&#62; 97&#37; were male

  Yep.

&#62; 75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.

  Hmmm, define social life.  I have friends and we go to concerts and 
see movies and stuff, so I guess I have one.  Girlfriend, no, but 
only by choice, not for lack of willing candidates :)

&#62; 85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
&#62; cards taken from parents wallets.

  Hell no.

&#62; ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
&#62; paranoia.

  Paranoia?  Who wants to know?  Why are you asking, huh??  You're 
from the CIA aren't you?  WELL I'M NOT TELLING YOU IF I'M PARANOID 
YOU GOVERNMENT SPOOK!  (hehe)

&#62; 80&#37; leaned towards depression. 

  Yeah, so?

&#62; 70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 

  Er, speeding ticket?

&#62; Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
&#62; instability, even to the point of needing
&#62; mental treatment. 

  SO WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM??  You wanna make something of it 
man?  Why are you looking at me that way?  SPOON!!!  No I won't take 
you to my leader alien scum!  I DON'T HAVE A LEADER!  Just, just, 
just, leave me alone man.....

&#62;Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
&#62; feelings through this use of virtual killing.

  I'm sure I have feelings somewhere around here.  Now where did I 
put those damn feelings?  HERE FEELINGS, COME HERE! *whistles*

&#62; It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
&#62; they feel this release from real life. 

  That's the whole point of computer games, isn't it????

&#62;If they die.. it
&#62; means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
&#62; again.

  Not true in UO.  It's a serious setback and one that I would very 
much like to avoid.

&#62; One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
&#62; makes it more costly to perform PK, the
&#62; problem will just become greater. 

  Who says it's a &#34;problem&#34;?  Is role-playing an evil 
character a problem?  Oh, sorry.  I thought this was a role-playing 
game.  My mistake.

Who says I'm unstable?</pre>
