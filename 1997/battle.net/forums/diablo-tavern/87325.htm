&#62; Good evening dear tavern:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I am not sure of the quality of this part
&#62; It was rushed out way too quick for my taste,But I always stay true 
&#62; to my Poetry
&#62; If it was written then it will be read ( I hope)
&#62; 
&#62; Also exit King leoric;
&#62; I have included a poem that Leoric wrote..
&#62; 
&#62; Relax and drink of my words..
&#62; and thank you all for giving me the inspiration to create.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;My dreams are no more,
&#62; I see not the dancing sun 
&#62; nor the sparkles of the stars
&#62; Nightmares, evil to the core
&#62; I am hounded  and must run
&#62; But where? All are fresh scars.
&#62;  
&#62; 
&#62; All I see are bones 
&#62; and kingdom nothing
&#62; 
&#62; Chapter 11
&#62; 
&#62; Bone Madness.
&#62; 
&#62; The flame receded and the madness waited.
&#62; Lurking into the fertile dark of his mind
&#62; It hissed, it barked, a mad dog hoping to find.
&#62; A bone.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Who am I?&#34; he asked  to the panes frosted
&#62; &#34;Not a king nor a man!&#34; just to remind.
&#62; &#34; But look at your finger! and tell me how fine.
&#62; shines.
&#62; 
&#62; Horror entered his soul and it screamed .
&#62; And it never stopped, that terrible yell
&#62; To this day I still hear it, a touch of hell.
&#62; I have seen his madness, it  gleamed 
&#62; of crimes.
&#62; 
&#62; Where the mortality of his small finger held.
&#62; The immortality of bone crackled and led.
&#62; Pointing at his sanity, the last shred
&#62;  shone
&#62; 
&#62; And then! was gone
&#62; 
&#62; The last I have seen 
&#62; was the scream keen 
&#62; into the night
&#62; Forever.. 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; King of Bones:
&#62; 
&#62; Bony fingers pointing weakly away.
&#62; From their deseased guilt.
&#62; sunken words.
&#62; drunken herds.
&#62; On the virgin morn, first ray.
&#62; Awaken the ivory fleet.
&#62; They said we had to be heard.
&#62; mute and deaf
&#62; it never occured.
&#62; 
&#62; At noon, burning brows.
&#62; Bloody sows.
&#62; Quickly I look back
&#62; beyond the torture rack
&#62; To hazed visions and shadowy dreams
&#62; I stare arrogant and proud.
&#62; And what do I see?
&#62; Bony fingers, broken words
&#62; Trembling at me..
&#62; 
&#62; Man it the guy mad or what...
&#62; 
&#62; See you all
&#62; Morteleux
&#62;
