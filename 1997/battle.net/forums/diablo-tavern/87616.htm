<pre>Ok, Lemme tell ya what happened :(

I was building up a warrior was about lvl12 and in a public game 
called &#34;Legits only&#34; or something like that I had just bailed 
from the Skeleton King to get more potions etc and this cheater came 
in..I asked him to leave and we got into a bit of a fight about 
ethics etc the usual stuff :)and he threatened to ruin my character 
&#34;Yeah yeah&#34; etc i said Anyways next thing i know BLAM..I was 
crashed frozen up in Win95 and when i rebooted and logged back on i 
created another game didnt think nothing of it and i noticed in my 
inv the &#34;red stuff&#34; i was keepin until my stats were high 
enough was all useable ..?!?!?! Confused i pulled up my stats screen 
and they were all maxed 250 str 50 magic 60 dex and 100 vit Holy F**K 
I thought so i rebooted and tried again..still the same :( I mean i 
knew some cheat progs were clever but this blew me away...Luckily it 
was only a lvl12 guy not lvl30+ with dots so deleting and restarting 
wasn't too bad (a pain but not too bad) I was wondering if anyone 
else has had anything similar happen to them or has heard of this 
before please let me know this is scary stuff a character ruined that 
easily ....Thankx in Advance and watch who u argue with :) the guys 
name was Lanc..something or other. 

Mippet (now lvl1)Warrior

If at 1st u dont succeed.......FORGET IT dont waste ya time </pre>
