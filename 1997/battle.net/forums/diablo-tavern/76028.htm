&#62;     hello slaves!
&#62;   First, Ishap..SHUT UP! You cheated to kill BLZ_BOBO and 
&#62; FLUFFY_BUNNY will not stand for your stupidity!!!!!!!
&#62;     ps. YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!
&#62;     NOW slaves, that the that is out of the way. FLUFFY_BUNNY, supreme
&#62; ruler of battle.net, has made a helpful guide for newbies.
&#62;   
&#62;     *******THE BOOK OF FLUFFY_BUNNY*******
&#62;          &#34;for convienient worshiping&#34;
&#62; 
&#62;   You must first recognize that FLUFFY_BUNNY is your master!!!! or
&#62;   YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!! Then the rest is easy.
&#62; 
&#62;    Now when you log on to my domain you will enter the chat area. You
&#62;  will meet other slaves and learn how to do my bidding. On the left 
&#62;  side of the screen are some buttons.
&#62;    THE CHANNEL button lets you roam to other chats to talk to other 
&#62; slaves.
&#62;    THE CREATE button lets you make your own game. This game must have 
&#62; praises to FLUFFY_BUNNY in the title. 
&#62;    THE JOIN button allows you to join other slaves in games all ready 
&#62; created. Pick one with the best praising title.
&#62;    THE QUIT button allows you to leave my domain. But why would you 
&#62; want to do that!!!!
&#62; 
&#62;     You will notice that all the slaves have a character icon next to 
&#62; their name. This tells you what the other slave's class is. Now on 
&#62; the other side of the name are little colored bars. These bars are 
&#62; the worship indicator. Slaves in good standing will have less bars. 
&#62; The colors stand for the following.
&#62;      Green = good slave, does much praising of FLUFFY_BUNNY.
&#62;     Yellow = Average slave. Needs to work on his worshiping.
&#62;        Red = BAD SLAVE.YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!
&#62;     Some slaves will have one to three little red dots over their 
&#62; character icon. These represent how many times FLUFFY_BUNNY has 
&#62; brought them to their knees, begging to be spared. One dot for every 
&#62; 100 times.
&#62; 
&#62;     
&#62;    There are terms in Diablo that you must understand in order to 
&#62; better worship FLUFFY_BUNNY.
&#62;    Guilds. Guilds are groups of slaves gather together so that they 
&#62; may worship FLUFFY_BUNNY.
&#62;    PK. PK stands for Peace Keeper. I someone who is a PK enters your 
&#62; game he will help you lighten you load. To make your trip easier. 
&#62; Some of the best Peace Keepers FLUFFY_BUNNY will recognize are slave 
&#62; TRACY_LORDS and slave MORTE. If you see them in you game. Invite them
&#62; down to keep the peace.
&#62;    Duping. When you duplicate and item. So he drops his stuff in 
&#62; front of the cows and presses alt+f4. FLUFFY_BUNNY will only 
&#62; encourage this specific type of duping.
&#62;    Hacks. Hacks are items which those who oppose FLUFFY_BUNNY use to 
&#62; try to make themselves worthy of challenging FLUFFY_BUNNY. YOU WILL 
&#62; ALL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!!
&#62;    ISHAP. A new term FLUFFY_BUNNY has coined to be used to describe 
&#62; anyone who cheats in a duel. ALL my slaves shall from this day forth 
&#62; use this term for that situation.
&#62;    
&#62;     In order to comunicate quicker in the chats. Slaves use short 
&#62; hand typing codes to save on time. Here is one more to be used from 
&#62; this day forward.
&#62;      PBFTB. &#34;PRAISE BE TO FLUFFY_BUNNY&#34;. In order to get the 
&#62; maximum amount of worship in the least amount of time.
&#62; 
&#62;     Well slaves!!! WORSHIP ME!!!!or PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62;           -FLUFFY_BUNNY(KBC) - Supereme Ruler of Battle.net
&#62; 
&#62; ps. ISHAP! SHUT UP! YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO BE MY SLAVE!
