<pre>Well, I finally got my Cd today. I was happy.
I then found out the full installation, the one to make it run like a 
beauty, takes approximately 420 megs. I was sad.
So I had to look at my hard drive. I decided to screw that and 
install it on a mininmal setting. Can you say turtle with 3 limp 
legs? This is a great idea to upgrade your hard drive, I'm upgrading 
mine tomorrow.
Well, I still had it installed and got to look at some of the 
features. First of all, the game took 3 hours to load becuase you are 
first required to download a million patches. That wasn't that bad. 
But then it said I couldn't play, cause it needs to be run in 16-
color. I go ack. So I put it in High-16 color. That kicks ass. So it 
finally ran. I got to watch the cool opening movie, but it's slooooow 
cause I'm running it off the Cd. Another reason of the update hard 
drive part. Now, dig this. It kept minimizing the window 
automatically. So, I had to go back to good old 640x400. God, 
everything is so big. The answer to this quandry, according to UO 
support, is to edit my Uo.cfg file. Umm, ya.
Well, I still got to play character creation. Yes, that is fun. You 
can choose from multiple templates, like warrior, wizard, assassin, 
thief, bard etc. I chose the wizard template, cause magic is cool. 
When you choose the template, it automatically chooses your strength, 
magic and agility (I think that's it) and chooses your skills. You 
are able to still modify these thoughs. Among these attributes and 
skills, you get to distribute 100 points among the three in each 2 
things (skills and attributes). The attributes affect your hp, mp and 
stamina.
1 Strength - 1 Hit point
1 Magic    - 1 Magic point
1 Agility  - 1 Stamina
For my guy, the template offered that it would be Strength 25, 
Agility 25 and Magic 50. I thought that sounded cool, so I agreed. On 
to my skills.
For my skills, the offered were Inscription, Magery and Spell 
Resistance. I liked the first 2, but the Spell Resistance I thought I 
couldn't care less about. So I changed that to Tailoring, so I could 
dye myself some kick-ass clothing and make some money dyeing for 
others. I then split up 100 points by going 33, 34, 33. That way 
everything is nice and even.
After that, you get to customize your character look. You can 
customize the following-
The Name         - duh.
Password         - Here you can password protect your character,      
              keeping out your brother, father, sister,               
     granddaughter, dog etc.
Skin Tone        - Black, White, tanned, even make yourself look like 
                   a zombie.
Hair color, type - You can adjust your color of hair, and the         
           hairstyle. The hairstyles go from bald to Afro.
Facial hair      - Type and Color. Goatee, moustache, beard etc.
That's about as far as I got. After that, it would say it was trying 
to get me on the server, but nothing happens. Maybe too much traffic, 
I have no idea. I will try later tonight, and early tomorrow when the 
server traffic isn't as busy.
Until then, I guess I'll be having fun playing Diablo. 

Take it easy,
Tyrael
