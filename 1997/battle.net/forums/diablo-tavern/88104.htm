<pre>The Story of the Dying Soldier

	I Remember how it started, sitting in church with my family.  I 
remember my sons Matt, Sam, Adam, and Kevin in awe of Archbishop 
Lazarus. He  was giving us a homily for the ages:

&#34;I have heard that the evil one is arriving.  Beware and afraid 
for he is the one that will punish all the unworthy sinners of this 
town!!  We must prepare for the wars that will come.  The evil that 
arrives with the coming of Diablo is something that of your 
nightmares!!!  Be afraid, denounce all of your sins, take faith in 
our Lord and you will be able to stand up against the monstrosity 
that is upon us......&#34;

Looking around I saw all of the townsmen take faith in his homily.  
You could see the anomaly of men realizing that we could defeat the 
coming evil.  We could defeat the ones set against our town.  We will 
not fail!  And as Lazarus continued with his speech, the men started 
to rise from their seats.  

&#34;Come men of Tristram, follow me down to the dungeons beneath 
this church we can and will deliver the faith to those that would 
destroy our village....&#34;

All the residents strode purposefully from the church with their 
families trailing behind them.  My sons and I arrived at our home and 
walked down the stairs to our basement.  Here I uncovered my family 
chest.  I took out the key that my sons had seen many times, but 
always wondered what purpose it was for.  I explained to them that 
our ancestors had originally fought against the evil Daiblo and his 
brothers.  There our forefathers battled  courageously against the 
three brothers and finally after a great cost to the lives of our 
ancestors we vanquished Daiblo.  Here remains the armor, weapons, 
helms, shields, and good luck charms that our family wore in those 
battles.  Opening the chest I called forth my sons, giving them the 
armor of our ancestors.

	Matt my eldest son received the field plate, broad sword, gothic 
shield, full helm, and two rings that were always worn with the hope 
that they would help the wearer swing more freely and strongly.   Sam 
my son received the scale mail, long bow, helm, and the pendant that 
allowed the wearer to see farther and clearer than most.   Adam my 
largest son received the full plate, maul, and great helm that only 
his large frame could carry.  My youngest son Kevin could not wear 
any armor due to his young body, but instead received the root of a 
tree trunk that my ancestors said was to be magical.  As for myself  
I dug out the chain mail, a claymore,  kite shield, cap, and a ring 
of silver to fight in the battle ahead of us.  We were ready now not 
only in the faith that Archbishop Lazarus had installed in us but the 
faith of our forefathers' equipment.  We strode up acceded to our 
room of living to say farewell to my wife and daughters when we heard 
commotion outside our house.

	Quickly we flew through our doors spreading out in await of trouble, 
only to see our neighbor and friend in anguish.  In wonderment we 
crossed to Andy to find out what was causing his pain.  

&#34;Our wives and daughters, they are gone......&#34;

	Turning with fear and adrenaline that I had never experienced before 
I searched through out the house to discover that Andy was right, 
they were not there!!!  Once again outside I gathered my sons and 
neighbors and walked to the center of town to find the men of our 
village gathered around the Archbishop and Griswald the Blacksmith.   
As we gathered we found out that all the women of the town were gone. 
 Young or old they had disappeared.  We looked to Archbishop Lazarus 
for his guidance, how could this happen! The Archbishop rose from the 
ground that he was kneeling on and spoke to us:

&#34;Men of Tristram I have asked the Lord to help me find where our 
loved ones have traveled to, and he has granted my request.  To the 
dungeons they have gone.  Diablo has called them to him.  We must not 
give up our faith, we must conqueror the evil that would be set 
against all that this world believes in.  Be strong in your faith and 
follow me to the dungeons, where we will vanquish this terror!&#34;

The men of our village took to  heart the worlds of the Archbishop 
and gathered our courage to go forth and fight the evil spawned by 
the filth that would steal our wives and children.  Pepin the Healer 
came forth from his hut and prayed for our good health, giving us 
vials of ointment to stop bleeding, potions of vigor to keep our 
stamina, and bandages to bind our wounds.  We were ready and we 
traveled in silence to the church, gathering our courage that we 
would need.

	There we meet the priests and monks that the Archbishop said would 
aid us in our travels.  My sons and I looked at each other grasped 
hands and descended down the stairs of the dungeons below the Church. 
 The townsmen split into groups of five to ten men, searching for our 
beloved wives and daughters.

	With Mat and Adam in the lead,  Kevin in the middle and San and me 
covering the rear we proceeded to the maze before us.  Before even I 
could wonder what monstrosities we would deal with, there were bats 
surrounding us everywhere.  Hacking, slashing, pounding, and blocking 
we fought for our lives.  Rise and fall, back and forth, all I could 
think of was to keep my sword moving and to protect my boys.  And 
then it was done, scattered on the floor were puddles of destroyed 
bats, purple blood flowing everywhere.  As I turned to my boys, young 
Kevin toppled to the ground.  NOOOOO!!!!  Rushing to his side, I 
grabbed Pepin’s potions and shoved them down Kevin’s throat to no 
avail.  My son died in my arms from a gash in his head.  
	
With anger boiling in my veins I stood and gathered my three reaming 
boy to my side.  Cutting through the grief I felt, I heard the most 
dreadful voice ever:

&#34;Ahhh Fresh Meat&#34;

Anger still boiling in my veins, grief stricken I heard the dying 
voices of the men of my village.  We ran through the maze to the site 
that will dog my sleep forever.

	There a beast ten feet tall, waving a butcher’s cleaver was hacking 
his way through the stunned villagers.  Calling to my fellow friends, 
to awaken them from their stupor, my call never left my throat.  
There in front of my eyes were the Archbishop and his priests casting 
evil enchantments on the women from our village.  The spells were 
turning our women into monstrosities before our eyes.  They turned to 
look at us ripping of their clothes and gathering their hands 
together flung balls of  red, blue and yellow light at the men of 
Tristram.  I awoke from the shock to see my fellow men cleaved by the 
butchering monster.  I turned to my sons only to find they were 
locked in shock and being pelted by the globes of light shot from the 
evil creations that the women were becoming.  The only other man not 
effected was strong Griswald.  We looked at each other and strode 
forth to fight the monster.  I looked to my left and saw Lazarus and 
his priests taking aim with their staves at me.  

	Spilling from those staves came bolts of lightning, balls of fire, 
charges of electricity, and huge globes of writhing fire.  Ducking 
and dodging not only the balls of light pouring from the evil 
creations that the women had become, but the spells cast from the 
priests and monks gathered around Lazarus.  Griswald and I retreated 
down the halls that we had traveled.  There we fought the monster 
waving his cleaver, but watching in the back ground I saw my sons 
explode from globes of fire shot from the evil the women had become.  
Distracted at the death of my sons, the cleaver descended into my 
ribs shattering my rib cage.  If it was not for Griswald’s efforts to 
fight of the butchering monster, I never would have made it up those 
stairs to tell you this story.

	Please beware of the Butcher he in junction with Lazarus killed our 
family and village.  ‘Ware the evil creations our women have become, 
please release them from their tormented lives.  ‘Ware the evil 
priests and monks, and their staves that spurt forth magical powers.  
Most of all please go forth and find my family’s heirlooms.     
Please .... cough, cough... find the shields we wore.  They were 
called BlackOak and Storm  ... cough, gasp...  find our swords the 
Defender and Shadowhawk and our bow BlackOak.  Please, please 
vanquish the evil that has destroyed our ... couch, gurgle.... 
village... cough, gasp...  help... gurgle.. us........  

And my body lay still.
