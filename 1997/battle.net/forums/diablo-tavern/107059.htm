&#62; &#62; This was posted on LaWizards Chatzone by a person named SF. I found 
&#62; &#62; it very interesting. Maybe you will too.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.
&#62; 
&#62;   Not me.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 97&#37; were male
&#62; 
&#62;   Yep.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
&#62; 
&#62;   Hmmm, define social life.  I have friends and we go to concerts and 
&#62; see movies and stuff, so I guess I have one.  Girlfriend, no, but 
&#62; only by choice, not for lack of willing candidates :)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
&#62; &#62; cards taken from parents wallets.
&#62; 
&#62;   Hell no.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
&#62; &#62; paranoia.
&#62; 
&#62;   Paranoia?  Who wants to know?  Why are you asking, huh??  You're 
&#62; from the CIA aren't you?  WELL I'M NOT TELLING YOU IF I'M PARANOID 
&#62; YOU GOVERNMENT SPOOK!  (hehe)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 80&#37; leaned towards depression. 
&#62; 
&#62;   Yeah, so?
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 
&#62; 
&#62;   Er, speeding ticket?
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
&#62; &#62; instability, even to the point of needing
&#62; &#62; mental treatment. 
&#62; 
&#62;   SO WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM??  You wanna make something of it 
&#62; man?  Why are you looking at me that way?  SPOON!!!  No I won't take 
&#62; you to my leader alien scum!  I DON'T HAVE A LEADER!  Just, just, 
&#62; just, leave me alone man.....
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
&#62; &#62; feelings through this use of virtual killing.
&#62; 
&#62;   I'm sure I have feelings somewhere around here.  Now where did I 
&#62; put those damn feelings?  HERE FEELINGS, COME HERE! *whistles*
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
&#62; &#62; they feel this release from real life. 
&#62; 
&#62;   That's the whole point of computer games, isn't it????
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;If they die.. it
&#62; &#62; means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
&#62; &#62; again.
&#62; 
&#62;   Not true in UO.  It's a serious setback and one that I would very 
&#62; much like to avoid.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
&#62; &#62; makes it more costly to perform PK, the
&#62; &#62; problem will just become greater. 
&#62; 
&#62;   Who says it's a &#34;problem&#34;?  Is role-playing an evil 
&#62; character a problem?  Oh, sorry.  I thought this was a role-playing 
&#62; game.  My mistake.
&#62; 
&#62; Maverick
&#62; Who says I'm unstable?

HELLO, STUPID,  if your too ignorant to figure out what the article 
is saying, then do the online gaming world a favor and cancel your 
ISP and sell your computer so that someone who can grasp concepts 
will understand what the article was saying.  For you dipsh!t I will 
spell it out.  Read carefully, read 2 times if it helps.

A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY UO AS A PK'R ARE NOT ROLEPLAYING.

I'm not sure, I'm not as allknowingly smart as you, but I don't 
believe the article said &#34;Maverick is a PK, so he is a under 16, 
stealing, misfit.&#34;  Do yourself a favor and quit taking all these 
things so personal.... Or is it that because some of these things are 
hitting so close to home that it really bothers you.....   Makes one 
wonder....

Novotny(Snakegod)

I included the snide remarks as a way to relate to the way 
&#34;SOME&#34; of the pk types respond in their messages to people 
who make a mistake.  It's pretty easy to do when you don't think of 
what your going to say before you say it....</pre>
