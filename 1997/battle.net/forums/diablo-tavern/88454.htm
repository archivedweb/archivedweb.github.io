<pre>Yo, I don't know what your issue is, but let me tell ya a few things.

Tarot has been around for a long time, they have had their ups and 
downs and have bounced back pretty nicely of late. I don't know these 
other guilds you mentioned and that means they are not talked about 
on this board much. Since I spend a lot of time here I wanted to 
belong to a guild that was known here.

Tarot has a very cool structure and I believe some strong leadership. 
Due to the fact that issues are discussed with a majority of members 
before guild wide decisions are made, that makes for policy the 
majority can live with.

Now as long as your just blowing off steam because you asked to join 
Tarot and were blown off because you cheat or your just a pain to be 
around, then have no fear, I have never smoked anyone for being 
annoying. (Well, almost nobody...)

But keep in mind, I am Death now. And as such I have to follow the 
orders of those above me. I also have to protect the honor and ideals 
of Tarot. (You know, its that whole lack of structure and leadership 
thing you were ranting didn't exist.)

Anyway, if you wanna &#34;talk&#34; about it, cool. Pick a night to 
hang in the Tarot channel and educate yourself. Maybe you'll change 
your mind.

If you wanna be hostile about it, well, I just hope you don't choose 
that card from the deck. Get me?

Have Fun,






       Cuda       O;)</pre>
