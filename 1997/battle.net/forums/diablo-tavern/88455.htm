<pre>well, i was co-oping with three of my friends tonight, lvl 35 rouge, 
lvl 31 mage and a lvl 12 warrior (yeah, we gave him a tp so he could 
join us and not feel left out), so we go hunting in hell.....me being 
a lvl 22 warrior, kinda protected the mage and rouge from enemies 
getting too close and used my newly bought KSOH (around 93k if i 
remember) to kill anything that came near us, well my lvl 12 warrior 
timed out, so there was only us three there to fight laz, i was able 
to get alone with laz while my friends killed all those advocates 
around us......when laz was killed, my mage friend tped to town and 
me and my other friend wandered around looking to see if they were 
any other things to kill......well lo and behold i find a sword 
called &#34;great sword&#34; it was in gold lettering so i figured 
hell, this should be good to indent and sell, later on i find another 
sword &#34;bastard sword&#34; also unidentified, so i also take that, 
and later i find an axe and a piece of armor......well me and my mage 
friend timed out and couldn't get back into the game, so my rouge 
friend killed diablo and i was again denied a second dot :(......so i 
decided to indent these 4 items i found.......well, first the armor,  
i got a gothic plate, not bad, but my plate of ages was doing me 
good, and i had an awesome plate as a backup, so i sold it....next 
the axe, turns out to be an axe of the vampires, pretty good, but i 
wanted to see what that bastard sword was so i held onto it, i ident 
the bastard sword, and get a sword of gore, well......goodbye axe, i 
like the name of that sword......lastly, i had the &#34;great 
sword&#34; to indent....i spend the 200gp or so to ident it....turns 
out that &#34;great sword&#34; was The Grandfather!......i don't 
think anyone can imagine how f!#^ing happy i was when i saw 
this......all those vets out there must be going &#34;oh yeah, the 
grandmother, so what&#34;, well to me, this is great, because i have 
never found the grandfather before, the best i got was finding a 
knights sword of haste, which i still have in my inv :)......well 
that was my best day on bnet........see ya i'm going to sleep now :)

MLK out......
