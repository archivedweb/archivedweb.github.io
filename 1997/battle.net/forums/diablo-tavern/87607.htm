&#62; My prediction of what will happen to guilds:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; As we know the amount of people buying Diablo and going onto Bnet has 
&#62; slowed down. Once the flow of new people comes down to a trickle, 
&#62; (assuming that some will stop playing for a while) many clans will 
&#62; die out, to the point of begging people to come in, lurking in every 
&#62; chat room begging.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Pk Guilds:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; They are doomed, you see after the flow of &#34;newbies&#34; that 
&#62; dont know anything about Bnet everyone will become paranoid and never 
&#62; play in Public games. What this leaves in a Bnet in which everyone 
&#62; will be in password protected guilds, the only way to PK would be to 
&#62; get into the guilds, but the guilds wouldn't be recruiting anymore 
&#62; because----&#62; no one to recruit accept other guild members. So PK 
&#62; guilds will be killing each other and will eventually die out
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Non-anything guilds
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; They will be in their own private games and will last longer than PK 
&#62; guilds but will be spending so much time keeping the PK's out they 
&#62; won't have time to play. Resulting in the Decline of these guilds 
&#62; too. 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; So u see we all are doomed :)
&#62;

Hell_Storm, man don't think like that.  Our guild is still growing  & 
we got nearly a 100 members now & we compete in all the ironmans & 
the legit duels are damn fun, lighten up :)  BTW I heard about your 
strange flail of the slaughter you got from Nomad, put'em up bro 
let's see if you can beat me with it.  By the time our guild dies 
Diablo2 will be out :)  Soon we won't even be recruiting, we got 
plenty of members.

Also Hell, put Hell_Storm(DarkAngel) by your name, not 
Hell_Storm(recruiter) even though that is your position.
Cya soon,
DArkwind</pre>
