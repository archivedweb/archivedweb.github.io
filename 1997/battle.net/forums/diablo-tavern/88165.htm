&#62; The unusual thing about your post, Wiseman, was that the first 
&#62; thought that came to my mind was home.
&#62; 
&#62; Not too many of you probably know too much about Cincinnati, OH, or 
&#62; even more specifically, Clifton.  The University of Cincinnati, where 
&#62; I'm currently going to school, sits right in the middle of Clifton.  
&#62; To sum it up, Clifton is a hole.  I hope I didn't offend anybody.  
&#62; But I walk 4 or 5 city blocks to campus, walking over broken glass, 
&#62; ducking under tree branches, watching out for the part of the 
&#62; sidewalk that has been missing for as long as I've lived here, wave 
&#62; to the colored elderly man that always sits on his porch, nod to the 
&#62; lady on the porch next to his as I look past the Christmas lights 
&#62; still decorating the house, and walk down the hill to campus....  
&#62; 
&#62; ...a campus that is currently just a big wooden wall with bulldozers 
&#62; and whatnot dragging dust everywhere.  The entire campus has about as 
&#62; many trees as I have fingers and toes.  All and all the campus is an 
&#62; eye sore.
&#62; 
&#62; I could write a five hundred page book about the ignorance of UC, 
&#62; from the library that was built with out accounting for the weight of 
&#62; the books to the pastel colored architecture building without a right 
&#62; angle anywhere in it.  But I will not.
&#62; 
&#62; Day in and day out this kind of thing gets old, so I fill the old 
&#62; tank up with gas and embark on my 120 mile treck to the small town of 
&#62; Coldwater, OH every once in a while.  I take old 75 north a ways and 
&#62; turn when I think I'm in the middle of nowhere, and a half an hour 
&#62; later I'm there.  
&#62; 
&#62; Well, what the hell is out there?  Nothing.  It's great.  There is no 
&#62; pollution, no traffic, no maniac psycho triple lane changers, and no 
&#62; crime save the under age drinkers (and we have a bunch of those).  
&#62; Everyone needs to go to these places once in a while, and when these 
&#62; places don't exist anymore, we use our military power capable of 
&#62; blowing up the world twenty times over, and punch out the old time 
&#62; clock.
&#62; 
&#62; And my contribution to all of this will be a drop in an ocean of 
&#62; technology that will eventually turn us all into Gods, or die trying. 
&#62;  Either way, we lose.  I'm not being negative about this, it is just 
&#62; that dying doesn't appear to be too much fun, and having the power to 
&#62; call ourselves God doesn't seem to exciting to me. &#60;yawn&#62;
&#62; 
&#62; I'll tell you this:  In just about everything we do all the fun is 
&#62; getting there.  So whatever ends up happening to us, death or 
&#62; immortality or both, the idea is to get the most out of this crazy 
&#62; parade.
&#62; 
&#62; Now back to my regularly scheduled bit rearrangement....

	Aahh...nature. I understand completely what you mean by getting away 
from it all. I am fortunate enough to live practically smack dab in 
the middle of no where. I am surrounded by swamps, forest, grassy 
fields, and a beautiful river. My favourite past time in the summer 
here is to, at around dusk, climb up onto the top of my roof and 
watch the sun set (which is far more gorgeous than the ones you see 
on travel brochures), and then spend as much time as possible gazing 
up at the stars. If any one out there feels that humans are the most 
important species out there just spend fifteen minutes staring up at 
a clear night sky and you'll feel like the most insignificant form of 
life and you will LIKE it. This may sound crazy to many of you but if 
I was given the choice between having the latest technology, games, 
and enough money to make you a king or the ability and time to gaze 
up at the night sky, well, you just cannot beat those sparkling 
stars. Kiri-Jolith is one very smart person. We all need to stop 
every thing from time to time and just look at every thing we take 
for granted. How many of you can REALLY describe the texture of a 
stone or the feeling of soil falling between your fingers? How many 
of you can accurately describe the feeling of tree bark or the 
feeling of a tiny ant couragously crawling across your hand? How many 
of you stop for a significant amount of time to watch a spider spin a 
fresh web in the morning or stop to watch the feathers on a crow's 
wings flutter as it glides on a breeze?
