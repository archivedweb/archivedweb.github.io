<blockquote>
<pre>During my intense perusal of this forum, I've come to the conclusion 
that there seems to be only two types of posting.  The first being 
the 'Oh no, someone PK'ed me and now I'm all depressed and suffer 
from  a chronic lack of self esteem, please help me or I'll never 
stop whining about it....blah blah etc'.  The second is the 
compulsory 'I cheat and hack and dupe because I don't give a 
shit.....drone drone...I'm so awesome....blah blah....don't mess with 
me or I'll tell my mother....etc'.  

This is all very pathetic.  I mean, sure, it sucks when some complete 
tosser who feels that he has to make up for his incredibly small 
genitalia by running around killing those weaker than himself, thinks 
it's his civic duty to ruin your fun, your stats, your game and your 
life in general by slaughtering you.  However, whining incessantly 
about it is not going to change anything, except by making people 
despise you for whining incessantly about it.  Get over it.  Life is 
full of utter bastards.  I know because I've probably met most of 
them.  This is going to sound rather cliched, but I feel I have to 
point it out yet again.  There will always be those among us who are 
incompetent.  By incompetent, I mean they suck at things.  They suck 
at life, so they spend 95&#37; of their time in front of a computer 
screen.  They suck at relationships, so they go to the local sex 
emporium and purchase a blow-up sheep.  They suck at Diablo, and in 
fact most computer games that require the merest hint of intelligence 
or rational thought.  Therefore, having been lobotomised at birth, 
their only other option is to cheat.

These individuals, however irritating they may be, do not deserve our 
anger or even our contempt.  They deserve our sympathy.  'Why?', I 
hear you ask, 'The miserable bastard just killed me and stole half my 
gold!'.  Your indignation at this occurrence is entirely justified, 
and believe me when I say, I understand it fully for it has happened 
to me more often than I care to mention.  However, bear in mind, that 
this act of gratuitous violence is nothing more than a cry for help, 
and it's also very likely that is has been the highpoint of the 
perpetrators week.  This person has no life.  This person is a deeply 
sad individual who no doubt suffered some horrible trauma during 
childhood that has left him severely psychologically scarred and 
still nursing painful feelings of inadequacy, loneliness and a deep 
sense of insecurity.  He now suffers from chronic incontinence and 
has been rendered terminally impotent as a result. 

 When next you are unfortunate enough to come across one of these 
lost souls, as you lay on the cold stone floor surrounded by an ever-
growing pool of your own bodily fluids and doing your very best not 
to lapse into unconsciousness, remember these words.  As your slayer 
stands over you, wiping his bloody sword clean on your tattered 
leggings, and tormenting you with such profound and deeply meaningful 
statements such as 'Ha ha ha, you suck you sad bastard!' and 'Suck on 
that one matey, now I've got all your cash, I'm off to buy myself 
another blow-up sheep!', don't respond in kind.  Don't give in to 
your rage and retaliate with the tried and tested 'Oh fuck off you 
warty little scab!'.  Instead, look deep into his eyes, feebly reach 
out to take his hand, and with your last dying gasp, say 'I feel your 
pain brother.....arrrggghhh......*thunk*'.
