&#62; Greetings b-net denizens!
&#62; 
&#62; Guess what I found here in Krakow? One of those newfangled &#34;cyber-
&#62; cafes&#34; that'll give you access to the web for just 2 zloty an 
&#62; hour (60 cents). They even serve you beer as you type. Now THAT'S 
&#62; service!
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, I checked my hotmail account and got a mailbox-full of 
&#62; messages about some offshoot of Inferno. So I decided to use my 
&#62; remaining time to come and check out my favorite soap op ... I mean 
&#62; message board! Hey, it's something to help keep me entertained until 
&#62; I come back in August. Anyway, here are my thoughts on what I've seen 
&#62; and the choices I've had to make.
&#62; 
&#62; Quite a lot of people know that I've been deeply unhappy with Inferno 
&#62; for some time.
&#62; 
&#62; First of all, I'm sick of proven cheaters -- like Flux -- clinging to 
&#62; membership and making the rest of Inferno look like liars and 
&#62; hypocrites. I've seen Flux use hacks. I've seen her dupe. And yet she 
&#62; remains. Now I read that one of the supposed TO's cheats too? What 
&#62; happened to being a &#34;legit PK guild&#34; ... which is why I 
&#62; joined in the first place?
&#62; 
&#62; Second, I see that TheMan has reacquired Inferno membership. I have 
&#62; no particular problem with that. However, he has immediately reverted 
&#62; to the very same behavior that earned him his expulsion eariler: 
&#62; picking fights, backing away from duels and arrogating authority to 
&#62; himself. Apparently he has learned nothing.
&#62; 
&#62; Meanwhile, I find that Haplo is strutting around as a TO. Correct me 
&#62; if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same person who quit Inferno after 
&#62; TheMan was booted -- in favor of KoR? Even worse, according to 
&#62; Mikedog and Torquemeda, this new leader has found it necessary to 
&#62; cheat in order to save his bacon in a duel. Sorry, but these are not 
&#62; the type of &#34;leaders&#34; that anyone could reasonably be 
&#62; expected to respect!
&#62; 
&#62; Third, I see that the remaining members of Inferno are snapping at 
&#62; each other over the scraps of remaining &#34;power&#34;. Think what 
&#62; you will of Flux, but who can read Haplo's post &#34;putting her in 
&#62; her place&#34; and not be nauseated at its tone of childish one-
&#62; upmanship? Gee, I guess this is too far beyond what &#34;little 
&#62; people&#34; like me can understand.
&#62; 
&#62; Issues and petty conflicts like these have had me on the verge of 
&#62; quitting Inferno for months, but I have always been restrained by the 
&#62; desire not to hurt those good, legit and fun people who would remain.
&#62; 
&#62; Now I find that nearly all those great people who kept me in Inferno 
&#62; have shed their old, somewhat tarnished affiliations in order to 
&#62; create the new PoC -- players like Morte, Tracy, Fist, Elijah, 
&#62; Curunir, SnowRabbit and Torquemeda. The PoC has also attracted some 
&#62; pretty impressive former &#34;independents&#34;, such as Eugene (!), 
&#62; Blz and Possum.
&#62; 
&#62; The players in the PoC seem to have grasped that this is a GAME ... 
&#62; you know, a fun thing to do with people you know and like. No tinpot 
&#62; dictators. No &#34;master plans&#34;. No disgusting little power 
&#62; games.
&#62; 
&#62; So it turns out that there really isn't that much of a choice for me. 
&#62; Toss me a robe, Brothers! Await my return in August, for then we 
&#62; shall preach the true meaning of Chaos!
&#62; 
&#62; Puzzlebox (PoC)
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Yep, another 2 zloty well spent :)&#34;

Welcome aboard Puzz.

Too bad there are no beaches in Russia.  That's why i like Greece.

Later,
Tibbar-Wons
Guess who?

&#34;Fun is everything.&#34;</pre>
