&#62; For those who DO play console games, you might own a playstation.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, for those who do, you may have heard of Final Fantasy games by a 
&#62; company called Squaresoft, one of the most respected video game 
&#62; companies in Japan AND the US and they have made all quality games 
&#62; that have gotten huge sales (with the exception of the dreaded Secret 
&#62; of Evermore..that game WAS bad)
&#62; 
&#62; But, Final Fantasy 7 is coming out.....but what is it?
&#62; 
&#62; Final Fantasy is a game on 3 CD's for Playstation to be released on 
&#62; September 7 in the US, and then later for Windows 95 in early 98.
&#62; 
&#62; The game is, without a doubt, to be a GREAT game...but how so?
&#62; 
&#62; Simple.  EVERYTHING.
&#62; 
&#62; First of all, see the graphics.  For Eye Candy, it is VERY sweet 
&#62; Candy. :)  Then check out some FMV and AVI....NICE.
&#62; 
&#62; It has a killer soundtrack (not redbook Audio, though, but 
&#62; GREAT...best song is One-Winged Angel on the Cd Soundtrack)
&#62; 
&#62; It has an innovative battle system for RPGs of this classic nature. 
&#62; (not point and click, just commands like &#34;Fight&#34; and 
&#62; &#34;Item&#34; and such.
&#62; 
&#62; It has fluid animation, and unlike most FF games with little Japanese 
&#62; characters (Kefka rings a bell, even though many consider him the 
&#62; best video game Villian of all time, as I do...he at least makes 
&#62; almost EVERY damn top ten list I see on here for villians :), it has 
&#62; full sized characters for fighting.
&#62; 
&#62; It has ten characters to play as:  Cloud (main Hero), Barett (Big 
&#62; Burly Rebel Leader), Tifa (Powerful, Agile Waitress), Aerith 
&#62; (Magician and Flower Shop Owner), Vincent (Mysterious Man), Cat Sith 
&#62; (Cat riding a Stuff Moogle, and a Gambler to boot :), Yufi (Ninja 
&#62; Girl), Cid (Airship Captain, Chain Smoker), Red XIII (Beast and 
&#62; Astrologer), and Sephiroth (General, and one of the most powerful 
&#62; character I have ever seen personally for a game).
&#62; 
&#62; It has MANY Villians:  President ShinRa (Ruler of the ShinRa 
&#62; Corporation, cares only about money), Rufus ShinRa (Wants control of 
&#62; the company, VERY sick and evil), Palmer (Rocket Scientist with a 
&#62; lazy Streak), Scarlett (Weapons Developer with an Evil Streak), 
&#62; Heideggar (Odd one eyed guy, leader of the Soldiers and Turks), Hojo 
&#62; (Head of Science with a Mad streak through him), Reeve (Head of 
&#62; Building Development and a former dresser), and the Turks (A group of 
&#62; Four elite &#34;cleaners&#34; who take care of stuff for ShinRa).  
&#62; Also, MANY Others, I hear, including a supreme evil bad guy :)
&#62; 
&#62; It has an interesting battle system.
&#62; 
&#62; It has hype, and everyone is voting it the best game of all time 
&#62; already.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, is it worth it?
&#62; 
&#62; One thing lacking...multiplayer.
&#62; 
&#62; But, besides that, it looks KILLER.
&#62; 
&#62; Go check it out at <a href="http://www.sqla.com/unoffial/">http://www.sqla.com/unoffial/</a> 
&#62; 
&#62; I think the site may be down now for updating of their page, but it 
&#62; WILL be back.
&#62; 
&#62; FF7 will be great....but do not take my word for it, go check it out, 
&#62; just don't read the spoilers. :)
&#62; 
&#62; The Man

Right now, I'm stuck with FF3.  But if you've played the games in a 
consecutive order (from the very first, all the way to FF6Japanse 
(ff3usa)) you will have noticed how much better each one has gotten.  
I predict FF7 will blow every single game (including non-rpgs) away.  
But, that's just my opinion.  I think non-rpg'ers will turn RPG-
Freaks when they play this.  I don't have a playstation, but by the 
time it comes out in.. September is it?, I can wait until January for 
the PC release.

Anyhoo
