OK, OK, I lied! 
Sorry, there will be a #10. (I hate uneven numbers! Heheh)

Here ya all go. And sorry it took so long to get this far. If you 
haven’t read the first 8 parts of this (and assuming you would like 
to...O;) they can be found on the &#34;Tales Of Tristram&#34; Web 
Page, <a href="http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm">http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm</a>


Offspring set his torch down and dipped his foot into the pool. 
&#34;Come on in, it can’t hurt you… yet.&#34; Kai teased.
&#34;Thanks a lot.&#34; Holding his nose Offspring jumped in just 
like Kairaega had shown him, thirteen times already. He reached the 
jutting edge below the surface and pushed off, just like Kai had, 
thirteen times before. When he breached the surface he grabbed onto 
the ledge and hung there, just like Kairaega had, thirteen times 
before. To say Kai was losing patience was an understatement, but he 
knew he could not push Offspring too fast or the consequences would 
be fatal, once.
&#34;Was that so bad?&#34;
&#34;No, I guess not.&#34; Spring said, wiping water from his eyes 
with one hand while keeping the ledge in a death grip with his arm 
and side. 
&#34;OK, now I’m going to get out and...&#34;
&#34;Your What!?&#34; 
&#34;Calm down! I have to be in front of you to help you with this 
next part, stay calm.&#34; Kai pulled himself out of the pool and 
stood in front of Offspring, &#34;Now grab my ankles, good. Now put 
your legs straight out, use your back. Now kick your legs like I 
did.&#34; And Kai went on until Offspring was ready for the next 
phase of the lesson, the hardest one.


&#34;We are approaching Tristram.&#34; The rogue said.
&#34;I know, I can smell the coal fires of Ogden’s. There is 
something else, I don’t recognize it...&#34;
&#34;That is fear. Man’s fear. Something is wrong here and there are 
quite a few involved. We must hurry.&#34; They began a trot out of 
the forest into the township. Lord Marcus followed closely behind the 
rogue. When they broke into the center of town Griswold spun on them, 
&#34;Hai’chara! They have gotten behind us Ogden!&#34;
&#34;It is I, Lord Marcus!&#34; Marcus stood ready to draw his sword.
&#34;Ahh…,&#34; Griswold peered at the countenance and scars that now 
made up the face of Marcus. &#34;You do not look well my friend, and 
your eyes!&#34;
&#34;I know, I know, but I am able to fight. Where is the enemy?&#34;
&#34;They have not approached as yet. Ogden and I are to be the bait 
for a trap of the Ordo Rosae Moriatur. The Moredrim will attack soon 
and if Mistress Frylia and her lot know their craft it will be a 
short lived attack at that.&#34;
&#34;They are in hiding? There, and there?&#34; Marcus said pointing.
Ogden’s mouth went agape, &#34;How could you...?&#34;
&#34;I have learned much from my friend here. She has taught me to 
trust my other senses.&#34;
Ogden and Griswold looked around Marcus, then looked at each other, 
&#34;Your friend seems to have left you, my master. I see no one in 
the square but us.&#34;
Lord Marcus could sense the presence of the rogue next to him. Before 
he could query her she spoke into his ear. &#34;They cannot see me 
Marcus. Don’t ask why or they will think you mad. Simply tell them I 
have elected to stay in the forest and will support the battle from 
there.&#34; Keeping his head pointed straight ahead Marcus stuttered, 
&#34;She, ah... She will stay in the forest, it appears she sensed 
the coming battle. She is... she is of the sightless... eye.&#34; 
Marcus absently caressed his hollow eyes.
&#34;Ahh, I am sure Mistress Frylia will not mind the help, no matter 
whence it comes.&#34;
&#34;Yes, um... I will stay here with you two. We shall stand 
together against this enemy.&#34; Marcus could sense the rogue move 
off into the tree-line. As he walked closer to the hidden Ordo 
members he could perceive their locations by the intense emanations 
of emotions. Some were fearful, others building in rage. All of them 
determined. The scream from the opposite side of town startled all of 
them, the Ordo members held their positions, waiting for the signal 
to attack from Frylia. The screams became more frequent and more 
intrusive until Marcus added to the cacophony by yelling at the 
hidden warriors, &#34;How can you stay when Adria is obviously in 
need?&#34; Ogden put his hand on Marcus’ shoulder to draw his 
attention, &#34;She is in no need my good master. She is away from 
Tristram organizing a coven of other magic wielders. That is 
obviously the Moredrim trying to create a ruse. I am glad mistress 
Frylia is as wise in battle as she is deadly.&#34; 
Griswold walked to Marcus, &#34;Aye, the trap has been set, Ordo will 
spring when the Moredrim have entered range, not before.&#34;
&#34;I see.&#34; Marcus tried to pick up the sent of Moredrim 
warriors but the smells of town and Ordo’s warriors were too near to 
him. &#34;What type of beasts are these Moredrim?&#34;
&#34;They are an animalistic lot,&#34; Griswold responded. 
Marcus looked in the direction of the mountains, &#34;Animalistic? Do 
they have the senses of an animal?&#34;
&#34;I would assume so, they...&#34; 
&#34;They are going to smell the Ordo’s lying in wait! We must warn 
them!&#34; Marcus tore away from Ogden and Griswold and ran for the 
front lines where the Moredrim were expected to exit the mountains 
and enter the township. &#34;Frylia! Frylia! Your ambush has been 
discovered, we must rally in town!&#34;

Frylia lifted herself from the ground and listened for the sounds of 
an army moving, there was nothing. She cautiously turned to Marcus, 
&#34;Well if it wasn’t, it is now... My god! What has happened to you 
Marcus? Your eyes!&#34;
&#34;I have no time to recount my adventures now, please assemble 
Ordo in the town square. The Moredrim are moving and their senses are 
keen. They know your order lies in wait.&#34;
&#34;How do you know this?&#34;
&#34;Because I can smell your troupe! And if I can you damn well be 
sure they can!&#34;
Frylia peered deeply into Lord Marcus’ face. Without eyes she found 
it difficult to gauge his sanity. She decided to believe in him and 
ordered the bulk of Ordo Rosae Moriatur into the town square. She 
left roughly a third in place with orders to come running should 
battle break out in the township.



Spellstormer was startled awake by the sound of it. The guards 
stationed outside the door rushed in. Spellstormer raised his hand to 
them to keep them away as he lifted himself from the chair that had 
become his makeshift bed. Staring at the sight before him he shouted 
at the guards for light. They fell over themselves in their haste to 
light the torches and fire pits. Spellstormer kneeled down next to 
the shivering form on the floor and reached out his hand to, 
&#34;Don’t touch me!&#34; Salmissra recoiled at the nearness of him. 
She back-peddled away slipping and scraping on the gritty stone 
floor. &#34;Don’t touch me if you value your life!&#34; She sniffled 
and stuck at her self with the flat of her hands. &#34;Damn them! 
Damn them all!&#34;
Spellstormer, still crouched reached out with his thoughts and tried 
to sense his Queen, &#34;Don’t touch me!&#34; She nearly screamed at 
him breaking his concentration. &#34;Spellstormer stop trying to 
help, this is hard enough as it is!&#34; Salmissra tried to stand. 
Bracing her feet she pushed her back against the wall and slowly, 
deliberately, leveraged her body off the floor.
&#34;My Queen, I do not understand.&#34;
&#34;It has taken me outlandish effort to break this magic curse and 
what do I find when I awaken? You asleep and Kairaega no where in 
sight! What is the meaning of this?&#34;
&#34;We, we thought the only way to break...&#34;
&#34;You thought the spell permanent! Where is Kairaega, why is he 
not at my side?&#34;
Familiar with his queens ire Spellstormer reigned in his disbelief 
and controlled his voice as best he could, &#34;He has gone to find 
the Black Centra’dii. We thought it the only means of your recovery. 
We were apparently wrong, my Queen.&#34;
&#34;By all that is sacred! Did you think me so weak? Did you think 
my soul would wander helplessly through hell while you devised my 
release from the stone curse? Recall him at once!&#34;
&#34;Of course my Queen. I shall see to it immediately. Um, Hell, 
your majesty?&#34;
Do not question me about it now Spell, I need rest and food 
desperately.&#34;
&#34;Your highness, may I make a suggestion?&#34;
&#34;What?!&#34;
Spellstormer looked his Queen up and down in response. Salmissra 
followed his gaze and realized freeing her body from the stone was an 
enormous task for her mind and soul. Apparently her clothing was not 
up to the task as well. &#34;Guards!&#34; They all turned their 
staring eyes to less dangerous subjects about the room.



Offspring came bursting to the surface. &#34;That was good! You were 
down for ninety seconds that time. Are you still afraid?&#34;
Offspring wiped the water from his eyes and rested his forearms on 
the ledge, &#34;Not so much now. Still, I would prefer to be able to 
see the bottom.&#34;
&#34;Even when you become very proficient you will always wish that. 
All right we are ready.&#34; Kairaega leaped into the pool and came 
to the surface next to Offspring. &#34;Now this is going to take 
quite some time. The important thing to remember is your going to run 
out of breath. Don’t Panic! When your lungs begin to bur, Don’t 
Panic! When your face is going to explode, Don’t Panic! When you go 
unconscious, then you can panic. If you panic while we are down there 
we are both in very serious trouble, understand?&#34;
Offspring nodded and both of them began breathing very deeply for 
several moments then with a nod Kai wasted no time. Down he went with 
Offspring in tow at the end of a rope tied to each of their waists.

They swam down and down. When the light from above gave out, they 
still swam down. When the walls of the pool moved away and Kairaega 
could no longer touch them, they swam down. As the burning in his 
lungs built to a crescendo he could hear audibly, they swam down. 
When ears drums began to tear from the pressure, they swam down. Just 
as he thought he the force would crush the life out of him he felt 
the silky bottom. Following it to his left he found a wall. He wanted 
to open his eyes in the vein attempt to gather light and see 
something of what lay around him. He knew the pressure down here 
would snuff out any possibility of ever seeing anything again. He 
followed the wall along the bottom feeling for an opening. His 
fingers found a small crevice and followed it until it widened. It 
widened enough to fit his hand then his forearm, then he was jerked 
away toward the surface. 

Offspring was resolute that he would not panic. His face burned, just 
like Kai said it would. His lungs convulsed, just as Kai said they 
would. His ears ceased to hear anything after that load ripping 
sound, Kai hadn’t mentioned that! They reached the bottom. Springs 
thoughts began to wander then snap back to him, as if an unruly colt 
had been lashed to his mind and would not stay focused. There came a 
moment when he knew he could not make it back to the surface. He 
would drown here, here, in this pool of darkness. No one would ever 
find him here, he knew that. Even his spirit would be locked to this 
place. Wandering the bottom of this pool for eternity. That’s when 
his grasp slipped and he raced for the surface. He pushed off from 
the bottom and felt the line around his waist go taught. He swam up 
but his efficiency at the new skill was easily overpowered by Kai’s 
firm grip on the crevice he had found. Kai pulled himself into the 
cave and dragged Offspring’s kicking form behind him. He felt his way 
from sharp handhold to hard handhold. During Spring’s more fervent 
fighting he managed to hold onto the cave wall at the expense of his 
flesh. Kairaega had reached that moment, his muscles could not exert 
any more. His mind could not stay focused any more. It was over, 
finally, it was over. Then his hand broke into air.

Dragging Offspring out of the water was difficult. Spring had found 
the cave walls and was using them to force his way back out into the 
pool. Kai braced his legs on the walls of the cave and heaved. 
Eventually the rope went slack and Kai dragged Offspring’s lifeless 
body out of the water and onto the sandbar. After quickly rolling 
Spring onto his side he slapped his back and abdomen until the water 
came gushing out. When he heard Offspring’s breathing he collapsed 
next to him in the cramped little cave. 

Just as his breathing began to get under control he had a sense of 
vertigo. It took awhile for his eyes to relay the fact that he was 
staring up at a firelit ceiling a hundred feet above his head. He 
would have been fairly nonplused by this had it not been for the 
countenance of Stareye gazing down at him as though looking into a 
wet grave. &#34;So, look what the weird dragged in.&#34;



There ya go, give me a shout and let me know what ya think.

See ya soon!
