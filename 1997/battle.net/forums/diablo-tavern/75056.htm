<blockquote>
<pre>Hello.  If you read the forum posts #74924 and #74937, you will see 
some posts by Talon and The Godly Soul.  Talon used my name to post 
some disgusting, terrible, aweful post and it was sickening.  Then, 
later, The Godly Soul posted a post that &#34;ok'd&#34; raping women. 
 This HAS to stop.

I would like to make a petition to have Talon and The Godly Soul 
banned from the Diablo Forums, not for posting flames, but for 
posting sick, disgusting, harrassing posts to certain groups of 
American society.

The forum is read by people from 9 to 67 or so years of age.  Little 
kids read it to laugh and maybe post, as do many of us.  But today, 
that all changed.

Talon used my name, which I am not mad about, to post a sick, 
disgusting message.  This message was tasteless and was not a 
&#34;flame&#34; but a sick display of wanting attention.  NO ONE 
should have to read it, and it was in aweful taste and delivery.  
And, then he had the gall to later say that &#34;I&#34; did it.  God, 
we can't have that.

I am not mad at him for blaming me, but I believe non of us have to 
listen to that.  Calling someone &#34;gay&#34; is one 
thing...actually describing a person being raped in detail is in 
poor, poor taste.

And, then, The Godly Soul had the gall to post that &#34;raping women 
is okay&#34; and added some details.  That was uncalled for!!

For all the people on Battle.net who read that, and the little kids, 
I am sorry you had to read that, if you did.  But, I want to make 
those two pay.

I want like to have a petition to have them banned from the forum for 
their conduct.  I talked to several people on B.net.  One of them, a 
thirteen year old boy named &#34;EricTheRed&#34; was appalled and was 
angry at them.  FireBrand told me his ten year old sister read it.  
Other people from various parts of B.net called it trashy and a few 
of the female players were appalled, all for good reason.  The posts 
were an insult to B.net, us, players, guilds, and the general public.

You DON'T post about rape and such in a public forum, and The Godly 
Soul and Talon posted for it, Talon making a joke of it, The Godly 
Soul actually aproving it!  It is a shame some human dregs of society 
are allowed to have access to the forum and post those obscene 
messages.  Even Eugene, whom Talon called a lamer, would not post 
like THAT! (Eugene, if you even think you are under these lowlifes, 
don't think so.  Even though we are not on good terms, you are still 
MUCH better than them.)

So, I would like to start a petition (not like I need to, Talon and 
The Godly Soul may be banned anyhow, now that I think of it.)  But, 
this is a matter of principle.

I would like to state that The Godly Soul and Talon need to be banned 
from the forum for posting this sick, twisted, disgusting drivel in 
the presence of players of all ages, and they did it not as an attack 
on a guild, but as a way to really offend some people, and it was 
just terrible.  Then, The Godly Soul said rape of women was okay, and 
made several other comments.  Read posts #74924 and #74937 if you are 
old enough and have the stomach to view it. I would recommend not, 
they are trash and not worth your time.

But, I would like to state this....they need to be banned.  I ask all 
players and posters on B.net and the forum to sign this petition, 
which simply states The Godly Soul and Talon need to be banned for 
their conduct.  What they posted was wrong for everyone, and none of 
us deserve to hear it.  

So, please, waste one post and sign the petition and say you want 
them banned for posting such terrible and disgusting trash in the 
forum against other people and women.

We would all appreciate it.

Thank you, and God Bless if you sign this petition.

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

P.S.  Talon and The Godly Soul...I did not care who you guys posted 
as...but what you have done is a mockery to everyone in this place.  
I am not angry at you two...just disgusted members of the human race 
can act this way.</pre>
