<pre>Philosophically I have to thank you for voicing these comments, but 
just one thing.  I doubt that the majority of posts in this thread 
are from people I would call whiners.  Granted that many people 
choose to look at only the worst in life and accentuate that to the 
exclusion of all else, but this was a geniune sorrowful post at what 
Wiseman feels is wrong with the world (note the word FEELS, not 
THINKS, that's deliberate on my part).  I have to agree with his 
statements that there are problems out there, and I can even agree 
with much of what he said, but I cannot agree with the major 
specifics he listed.  I was trying to be polite and tactful, a new 
thing for me, and make the attempt to post a helpful reply without 
being my normal abrasive self.  Hopefully I succeeded..

I also don't (to steal one of the things you said) view humans as 
being capable of perfection.  Therefore I expect the world to be an 
imperfect place and bad things to happen sometimes.  To me it's also 
amazing how much we've been able to accomplish with our limited 
capabilities.

Lastly, I will state for the record that the problems we deal with 
have solutions, it's just that the solutions aren't palatable to the 
people who have adopted the more free-wheeling tenets of our modern 
culture (a culture which has, in fact, made WORSE many of the 
problems we face today).  Also, the solutions don't eliminate the 
problems - an impossibility in any case - but will at least contain 
them and limit them.

But that's a topic for another day.

&#34;Stay tuned for my next serious post, where I once again try to 
talk philosophically without being rude and turning almost everyone 
off....&#34;</pre>
