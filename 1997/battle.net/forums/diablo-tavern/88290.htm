&#62; That is 1.25, maybe closer to 1.26, million experience points.

Don't call Tracy a moron, it was your mistake in the first place. How 
do you expect us to know how much XP you get at level 49? Your post 
was pretty clear, I thought, that you said it was 10 per kill, 10K 
per hell/hell clear. But OK, -=SoulInferno=- also told me that you 
get 10K per kill at level 49, so I buy it. One day, perhaps I'll know 
for myself. It would seem then that the XP you get in Hell/Hell 
actually goes UP as you get into the mid-high 40's. I get about 8K 
per kill at 42, Salmissra and Shadowdancer told me they get around 9K 
per kill at level 46. Go figure. After 40 levels of declining returns 
on XP, it starts going up again. In that light, maybe I shouldn't be 
so pessimistic about getting to a really high level. I had thought 
that I'd stall out around 42 or 43, but now...

Another thing, I believe that different classes get different amounts 
of XP. Not sure exactly how it works, but here's what I found: When 
Lepthana was level 28, I decided to try normal/hell solo. I passed a 
level with the clear, so I decided to do it again. I went from 28 to 
32 in this way- one level per normal/hell clear (28 took less than 
one clear, 32 more than one, but basically, at the end of four runs I 
had four levels). Raising Stormrunner and Thelmonan, I figured I'd do 
the same thing at 28. Except that they didn't get close to leveling 
in one trip. The warrior got most of the way to 29 in one trip, and 
the mage didn't make much progress at all. Now that's hardly solid 
evidence, so I'm not sure what to make of it, but I do believe that 
rogues get more XP than warriors, who get more XP than mages. Not 
sure about that, though. Rid, fire up the boilers in the lab, it's 
gonna be a long night!
