<pre>	Yes I know most of you have probably forgotten about my story (it's 
been such a long time since I posted #3), but what can I say. I was 
sucked into a time portal and then the rest is all a blur.....

PART FOUR	
Enigma Found

	Shinnarhra, now possesed with finding the elusive stranger, set off 
once again. She was still haunted by the dark memory of her battle 
and rescue in the chasm.
	She entered the still forest, which seemed to be far more dense and 
sweet smelling on this side of the chasm.
	Travelling for several days Shinnarhra began to lose hope in finding 
the stranger and shuddered at the thought of having to turn around 
and face the chasm for second time. Then, early one evening, 
Shinnarhra walked through a small clearing and her rogue instincts 
began telling her that something was not right here.
	Then with a loud snap of her booted foot breaking a dry dead twig a 
massively intense energy sheild sprang forth from the earth 
enveloping her entire body. She was traped.
	With wide fascinated eyes Shinnarhra reached out her slender hand 
and ran it cautiously along the inner surface of the mystical bubble. 
Instead of having her hand burnt or shocked, as she had expected it 
to, she was delighted to find that it had warm comforting feel. The 
energy ran up her arm and saturated her body. She felt refreshed and 
calm.
	&#34;So. You've finally caught up to me.&#34;, came a familiar voice 
from, to Shinnarhra's surprise, high above her. There was no 
mistaking the deep powerful voice. She had found the stranger.
	Shinnarhra tried in vain to locate the stranger but the intense 
white light eminating from the mystical trap masked her keen 
eyesight. Shinnarhra was at a loss for words. She was excited to have 
finally found her mystery man but she was also frightened. Was he 
going to leave her in this glowing cage to rot? Was he going to kill 
her? Or, to her horror, would he take advantage of her young body. 
She would kill him before he could even try she thought.
	&#34;No, young one&#34;, came the voice again, which was drifting 
down to the ground from the high tree tops. &#34;I'm not going to 
harm you. I am, however, going to ask why you felt it so important to 
follow me this long and all of this way. And be truthful. I despise 
liars and I can detect a liar easier than a morning sun rising above 
the mountains. Be quick with your answer!&#34;
	Shinnarhra stammered some, all the while her heart racing like a 
tempest blast.&#34;I...&#34;, she began nervously, &#34;I...just 
wanted to ...um...see...I mean...&#34; The stranger smiled behind his 
facial coverings and said with some amusement, &#34;You wanted a more 
up close and personal encounter with the tall dark stranger. Isn't 
the right?&#34; Now that Shinnarhra thought about the matter, she 
wasn't sure why she had followed him. Something just seemed to draw 
her towards him.
	&#34;Well?&#34;, asked the stranger, who was no longer smiling and 
growing impatient. He held out a gloved hand and the mystical field 
confining Shinnarhra grew horribly hot and so bright Shinnarhra was 
forced to sheild her eyes with her arm. &#34;Yes! Yes! That's why I 
followed you! Please....my eyes!!&#34;, came her desperate answer. 
The electrical field vanished and Shinnarhra could feel the cooling 
forest air wrap itself round her. She felt dizzy, weak, and nausiated 
from the stranger's painful trap. She could now just barely see him, 
her eyes still adjusting from the searing white light to the darkness 
of the forest. He looked just as he had did at the inn. Imposing and 
mysterious.
	The stranger glared at the now recovering Shinnarhra. 
&#34;Come&#34;, he said, &#34;You must be hungry and tired from your 
little trip.&#34; &#34;And&#34;, he added with another smile, 
&#34;from the smell of things you could stand to use a good 
bath&#34;. Shinnarhra glared after him, filled with rage. She was 
tired and hungry though. She followed the stranger for some while. 
Neither of them speaking a word. Shinnarhra was still attempting to 
figure this dark figure out.
	Out of the drakness Shinnarhra could see a small camp fire. As they 
came to the edge of his camp she felt as though she had just walked 
through a warm, tingling waterfall but she felt no water and there 
were no cliffs or rockfaces to be found.
	The stranger sat by his fire, which to Shinnarhra's surprise, burned 
with an intense blue flame. She sat herself down on a bed roll by the 
fire. As she stretched out her hands to warm them a spark of blue 
flame jumped from the fire and landed on her hands. Immediately her 
body glowed a soft gentle blue. When the light subsided from her body 
she felt rested, her bruises and skratches were healed, and her 
clothing was now clean and meded.
	&#34;Better?&#34;, asked the stranger. Shinnarhra stared across the 
fire and replied flatly, &#34;Yes&#34;.
	Shinnarhra looked all round her and deep into the forest. Ever since 
she walked through the &#34;waterfall&#34; the forest appeared to 
look much differently. The trees seemed to be staring at her. Strange 
unknown animal noises echoed from the hidden depths of the forest. 
Tiny lights of blue, yellow, red, green, purple, and orange drifted 
silently throught the air. One of the lights, a green one, landed on 
Shinnarhra's nose and stared into her eyes. Shinnarhra could now see 
the tiny light had arms, legs, wings, a head, face, and body like a 
human but much more thinner. With a tiny giggle, the little light 
whizzed quickly off Shinnarhra's nose and into the forest depths. 
Even the sky overhead looked different. The stars shone much more 
brightly with gentle hues of gold and silver and they were arranged 
in constellations she had never seen before.
	Shinnarhra looked once more to the stranger. &#34;Would you mind 
explaining all of...this?&#34;, she asked calmly. &#34;Mortals and 
most immortals have forgotten how to view the real world. They mostly 
are only capable of seeing the world you know; the one you were born 
into&#34;, replied the stranger,&#34;but this is the true form of the 
world. Only a privelaged few can now still see both worlds.&#34; 
&#34;Then why can I see it?&#34;, asked the young rogue. &#34;Because 
I'm allowing you to see it&#34;, was the stranger's response. 
Shinnarhra was insulted. She looked away from the stranger.
	&#34;The trees&#34;, stated the stranger. &#34;What?&#34;, answered 
Shinnarhra. &#34;The trees. They don't like you.&#34; &#34;What are 
you saying? That these trees have feelings? They can hear us? I'm 
sorry, but I think you've spent too much time by yourself&#34;, 
Shinnarhra replied pleased with getting back at him for insulting 
her. &#34;They can do more than that&#34;, said the stranger.
	Shinnarhra, convinced with proving the stranger to be a crack pot 
got up abrubtly and drew her daggar and plunged it into the bark of a 
nearby oak. &#34;See?&#34;, she said, &#34;nothing. They're just 
trees.&#34; With those words the wounded tree reached down with a 
great thick branch and gave Shinnarhra a resounding slap on the back 
of her head which knocked her to the ground. &#34;Now they really 
don't like you&#34;, chuckled the stranger who was still seated and 
staring into the fire.
	&#34;Do you mind?!!&#34;, came the angry deep voice of the great 
oak. &#34;I've always said that humans were a waste of skin. Give 
them a blade and what do they do? Hack up poor gentle 
trees!Barbarians!!&#34;
	&#34;Hey! Why hit me? That guy over there is a human. Give him a 
good slap. Maybe it will shake loose some of the cobwebs  in his 
head!&#34;, yelled Shinnarhra who had now returned to her feet. 
&#34;Him? A human?!&#34;, was the surprised reply from the oak 
tree,&#34;Oh, you stupid mortal. Stonehaven's not a human. He's a 
Draco...&#34; Cutting the oak off abrubtly the stranger said, 
&#34;that's more than enough, Rangard. She doesn't need to hear my 
whole life story.&#34;
	&#34;So. You do have a name after all&#34;. smiled Shinnarhra 
looking at Stonehaven. &#34;We had better get some sleep&#34;, said 
Stonehaven,&#34;You've been through alot.&#34; And with that 
Stonehaven settled down for the night. Shinnarhra stared at 
Stonehaven for some time and after settling down herself she said, 
&#34;good night, Stonehaven&#34;, slightly making fun of his now 
public secret. &#34;Good night, little one&#34;, replied Stonehaven 
mockingly. Shinnarhra could feel her anger swell up inside of her. 
Rangard began to laugh at the disgruntled rogue. &#34;Good night, 
Rangard&#34;, said Stonehaven. &#34;Good night, my freind. Oh, and 
good night to you to, little one&#34;, replied Rangard who was now 
shaking with laughter. Shinnarhra swore under her breath and rolled 
onto her side facing away from Stonehaven and the rather amused tree. 
Stonehaven smiled to himself and fell asleep.

Thanks for reading. If anyone out there has any comments please feel
