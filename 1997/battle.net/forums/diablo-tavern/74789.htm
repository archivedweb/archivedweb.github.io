<pre>Tales of the White Wolf — Chapter Seven

	The sun began its rise into the morning sky. Rikor watched as Mandi 
surveyed the road in both directions. They had already been on the 
move of over an hour, carefully working their way through the woods 
toward the main road. Moments ago they came upon the edge of the 
road. Mandi had signaled for everyone to halt. She motioned them down 
into a squat and the rogue slid quietly forward to the very fringe of 
the woods.
	&#34;No one moving on the road now. It's still a little early for 
much travel. We must move quickly.&#34; she said in a low yet 
resolute voice..
	The fear that this delay would cause them to lose the trail of his 
sister and her captors nagged at Rikor as the band of travelers  
moved out of the forest and quickly down the well traveled road. The 
elf, Justin, had caused all of this. If he could just get his hands 
on that slender Elven throat he'd... He'd what! Rikor knew that 
Justin had meant him no harm. The elf was merely defending himself 
against the bullying of the Iron Deaths. The young warrior actually 
admired the elf for standing up to the Death. If only he hadn't 
chosen to do it in Rikor's presence.
	For nearly an hour they traveled. No one spoke. No one's eyes 
diverted from the road. Finally they encountered a small wagon, 
apparently a traveling theater group coming toward them from Tristram.
	&#34;Elario, you speak with them. Find out if they have seen 
Suzanna&#34; Rikor said to his brother.
	The younger brother hailed down the wagon and began to talk with the 
man holding the reins. The remainder of the party, Mandi, the wolf  
and Rikor took a rest under a large spreading oak at the side of the 
road. Rikor could not make out the details of the conversation, but 
both Elario and the traveler smiled and laughed on more than one 
occasion.
	After a few minutes the wagon began to move, the man waved at all of 
them and bade them farewell. Elario joined his companions on the soft 
grass in the shade of the tree.
	&#34;It seems that our friends there met up with a band of four men 
escorting a bound and gagged young woman just before last nightfall. 
They camped a hundred yards apart and the group escorting the woman 
had not broken camp when Rozo, the roving actor, and his group began 
their day. By his estimation we are a few hours to their rear. Rozo 
also mentioned that there are Iron Deaths patrolling the roads and 
surrounding countryside. Seems an elf, a warrior and a rogue killed 
one of them in Moonridge and they are not very happy about it.&#34; 
Elario related his conversion to the others.
	Rikor thought about the situation for a moment and then said, 
&#34;If we travel an extra hour or two before nightfall, we should be 
able to catch them by tomorrow.&#34;
	&#34;If we push hard we could catch them during the night&#34; 
stated Mandi, &#34;You could have your sister back tonight.&#34;
	&#34;Finding them and getting Suzanna back are two different 
concerns. We must have the opportunity to access the situation before 
attempting the rescue. We know nothing of the strengths or weaknesses 
of our opponents.&#34; Rikor was very firm and definite with his 
words. He could see the reaction in the rogue's eyes before she even 
responded.
	&#34;The longer we delay the higher the risk of something happening 
to your sister!! We must move quickly.&#34; There was fire in those 
words. The rogue obviously did not believe in subtlety.
	Rikor knew they must take care when they located their prey and he 
must somehow convince Mandi of that. The young rogue reminded him in 
many ways of his sister, fiery and headstrong. Both willing to rush 
headlong into hell for a cause in which they believed. Mandi, he 
thought, and Suzanna would most likely get along really well. His 
sister could use a female friend. She had spent nearly all of her 
time since their mother's death caring for her two older brothers.
	Hoping to compromise, Rikor said, &#34;Well we need to get on the 
road. We'll determine the best plan of attack once we catch them. 
Agreed Mandi?&#34;
	A reluctant nod of the head was the only response he got from the 
rogue.
	&#34;Don't be so hard on her Rikor.&#34; Elario whispered in his ear 
as Mandi started off down the road.	
	Rikor called for the wolf, who had wandered into the woods a few 
minutes prior.  The large white creature bounded from the brush and 
joined the two brothers in catching up with the fast moving rogue.
	&#34;Convincing this rogue of anything that she hasn't already 
agreed to is going to be difficult.&#34; Rikor thought. As they 
briskly traveled, following the road they knew would take them to 
Suzanna and eventually Tristram, Rikor considered many different ways 
of handling the situation with Mandi. None seemed to be right. He 
couldn't just force her to submit to his plan, but maybe she would 
compromise. Not likely, but.....
	The four rounded a bend in the road at his point and found 
themselves facing two men. The two were caring on a fairly heated 
discussion. One of the men, a weathered barbarian, tall and rangy of 
appearance, was using his hands to apparently make a point with the 
other.
	The other man was easily recognizable. He wore the black plate of 
the Iron Deaths. A gigantic two-handed sword hung at his side. His 
helmed head bobbed agreement and disagreement as he listened to the 
barbarian. 
	&#34;I'll not follow you to Moonridge to answer questions. You ask 
me what you will right here, I'll answer and then I'll be on my 
way!!&#34; growled the barbarian, his obvious disdain beginning to 
get the better of him.
	&#34;As a member of the Iron Deaths, I hereby order that you should 
accompany me to Moonridge to be questioned by my captain.&#34; 
shouted the Iron Death. You sense that his anger was about to take 
control of his actions.
	Rikor and his companions tried to go unnoticed, but the Iron Death 
caught sight of them and diverted his attention from the barbarian to 
the four of them.
	&#34;Halt. Come here and identify yourselves.&#34; roared the 
Death,&#34;Now!!!&#34;
	Hesitantly they did as requested, each preparing for what could 
occur next. The Death looked them over and over, including the great 
white wolf.
	&#34;What is that creature doing traveling with three humans?&#34; 
the Iron Death ask of none of them in particular.
	&#34;He's my pet.&#34; stated Rikor flatly.
	The Death now looked at Mandi and Rikor very closely. From one to 
the other his eyes moved.
	&#34;You two look like two of the three who killed of one of us in 
Moonridge. What say you?&#34; he asked of Rikor or Mandi as he slowly 
drew his sword from its home.
	&#34;Well....&#34; Rikor struggled to concocted a story that would 
be believable. He glanced quickly at Mandi, who for the first time 
since he had met her seemed without words. The young warrior knew 
that his answer could make the difference between all of them living 
or dying. His mind just seemed to go blank.
	&#34;I'll answer that for the boy.&#34; The comment came from the 
barbarian, whom the Death had completely forgotten. The tall figure 
was now standing directly behind the Death with his large polished 
blade drawn from its scabbard. The Death turned, but reacted too 
slowly. Before he had the time to get  his sword in a ready position, 
the barbarian had remove his right arm with one well placed swing of 
his weapon. Just as quickly the old warrior drove the end of his 
blade through the heart of the evil one. The Iron Death screamed 
once, lurched backwards and fell to the ground at Rikor's feet.
	&#34;Not bad for an old timer, huh kid!&#34; the barbarian said 
matter-of-factly. Rikor stood slightly stunned at what had taken only 
a few seconds. Mandi and Elario also were just as surprised, theirs 
mouths agape with astonishment.
	&#34;I'll be on my way. You youngsters drag that body off of the 
road will you? Those Deaths are always trying to bother me. I wish 
they would learn their lesson.&#34; the seasoned warrior said.
With a slight wave of his hand, he turned and started off down the 
road.
	The three youngsters watched as the barbarian, distinguishable only 
by his bright red tunic and the small tatoo of a serpent on his 
forearm, sauntered down the road in the direction from which they had 
come. They stood transfixed on the body of the Iron Death that lay 
before them.
	Finally Rikor spoke, &#34;Let's do as he said and move this 
body.&#34; the young warrior said as he and Elario grabbed the Death 
by his legs and pulled the body into a small ravine at the side of 
the road.
	Still in shock, the band resumed their travel in silence once again. 
They continued to follow the road, only occasionally seeing anyone 
else. Whenever they did encounter others, they just remained casual 
and continued with hesitation. They stopped once for water and to 
consume as little food, but only a few words were exchanged during 
the short rest. They all seemed to be possessed of a sense of 
purpose. The drive to overtake Suzanna and her abductors. This seemed 
to force them onward, pushing each other, silently forward.
	The sun had left the sky two hours before the spied a campfire one 
hundred yards from the side of the road. The wolf had sensed the 
presence of other humans first and had let out a soft growl to 
forewarn Rikor. 
	Rikor quietly caught the attentions of his companions and the group 
moved into a place of cover to discuss how to approach the situation. 
Rikor and Mandi of course disagreed and Elario tried to act as 
arbitrator. Finally it was decided that Elario would crawl forward 
and scout out the situation. Mandi and Rikor would flank him, back 
slightly.
	They put the plan into action and three were slowly moving forward. 
The wold had remained back, quietly waiting a word from Rikor to 
assist if needed.
	Elario slid slowly through the brush to the edge of the clearing 
where the fire burnt. At first he could just barely make out shapes 
within the camp. Then the occupants of the encampment came into focus.
	Elario stood straight up and shouted, &#34;Finston!! It's me, 
Elario.&#34;
