Tales of the White Wolf — Chapter Eighteen

	The Archbishop shifted and straightened his luxurious robes as he 
turned away from the haggard looking sorcerer. Mardran could see that 
his knuckles had turned completely white from the tight grip he had 
on his long ornate staff.
	&#34;He didn't take that too badly.&#34; Mardran thought, shifting 
his stance slightly to obtain a better view of Lazarus as he moved 
toward his throne at the rear of the room. The chamber had gone 
completely silent following his revealing the outcome of his quest. 
The only sounds one could hear were the rustle of the Archbishop's 
robes and the light tapping of his staff on the stones of the floor.
	&#34;Mardran, come closer so that we might speak.&#34; Lazarus said 
as he turned and sat upon the garishly decorated throne. He leaned 
his scepter against the side of the chair and motioned Mardran 
forward. &#34;We must devise an alternate plan to capture the girl. 
That girl is vital to the cause of the Dark Lord. She must be brought 
here and sacrificed.&#34;
	&#34;What could be so important about a simple peasant girl from the 
north lands?&#34; Mardran thought as he moved closer to the holy man. 
&#34;Your Grace, could we not find another sacrifice?&#34; he asked.
	&#34;This girl holds a secret that must never be revealed!&#34; the 
Archbishop's tone was  angry as he continued, &#34;Her father was one 
of the Circle of Five. They had discovered the force behind our 
Lord's power and could have used it to destroy him had they had the 
opportunity. The Five were slain and as were all of their offspring, 
except this girl. Surely you can see the importance in our bringing 
an end to this threat!&#34;
	Mardran did saw something in the Archbishop's eyes that frightened 
him. The look was one of madness, of rage, of utter evil. A shiver 
went up his spine as he diverted his gaze from the eyes of the evil 
holy man.
	&#34;She must die, as have all of the others, on the Altar of Blood. 
Her blood must mingle with that of the Circle of Five and their 
progeny. Only then will the almighty power of the Dark Lord be 
secured. I have caused the shedding of countless drops of blood in 
our struggle to devour this land, but none will be nearly as 
important as the killing of this girl.&#34; Mardran could see the 
veins on Lazarus's forehead expanding as the Archbishop spoke. He 
knew that Lazarus had a very violent temper and had been known to 
have an entire room of underlings slaughtered if angered. The Mage 
was trying to devise a way of escaping, but he feared that would only 
enrage the Archbishop more.
	Just then a tall Hell Knight entered the chamber and moved quickly 
to the Archbishop's side, he bowed and whispered something in the ear 
of the Archbishop.
	&#34;Diablo has requested my presence, immediately. I must go to him 
now. You will wait right here, Mardran, for my return!&#34; Lazarus 
ordered.
	Mardran tried to develop a plan to handle the anger of the 
Archbishop. He knew he could get the girl and bring her to Lazarus, 
but in the Archbishop's current state of mind he feared he would not 
be able to convince Lazarus of that. He found himself looking about 
the room, anxiously trying to insure his safety. He did not trust 
Lazarus to not just let loose a fireball without prior warning. The 
guards that remained in the chamber stood perfectly still, but their 
eyes never left the Mage. He knew that attempting to flee would 
result in a predetermined outcome, his death. Of that he was certain.
	And what did Diablo want with Lazarus at this time? Did it have 
anything to do with the situation with this girl? Might the Dark Lord 
have already determined Mardran's fate given the outcome of his 
mission. The Mage was beginning to fear for his life even more. He 
cursed the two rogues who had interfered with his plan. He had dealt 
with a number of obstacles while finding , capturing, and 
transporting the young girl. He could not believe that the random 
meeting with two young women could cause all of his planning and work 
to fail.
	He felt a chill, from a breeze that abruptly blew through the 
chamber. He had never understood how these random breezes came to 
blow through these halls so far below the surface.
It seemed as though the very earth itself was taking in a breath. He 
continued to look about the room, hoping to catch some inspiration 
for a solution to his quandary. He began to pace about. This 
disturbed the guards who were trying  to keep him contained.
	It finally came to him. In order to survive he must escape, 
recapture the girl and return her here to Lazarus. That was his only 
option as he saw it. Now how to do it?
	As he slowly moved about the chamber, an inspiration came to him. He 
began to slightly increase the speed of his movement. This served to 
put the guards more on edge. That was exactly what he wanted, to get 
them as jumpy as possible. After a couple of minutes he sprang his 
plan into action.
	A great ball of fire erupted immediately behind the Archbishop's 
throne. All of the guards made a move toward the commotion. At that 
instant, Mardran muttered the arcane words of the teleport spell and 
he suddenly appeared in a corridor two rooms away from the chamber of 
the Archbishop. Quickly he cast the spell again, and then again. He 
paused briefly to gather his wits and to listen for the sounds of 
pursuit. Far in the distance he could hear the noises of a 
disorganized chaos. A slim smile crossed his lips. He had succeeded 
thus far. Now he must continue to move toward the surface.
	He would obtain some degree of safety by reaching Tristram. There he 
would be able to lie low and complete his plan to regain the favor of 
Archbishop Lazarus.
	Luckily he was very familiar with these depths and was able to 
teleport himself quickly to the stairs on each of the floors as he 
ascended toward the surface. Within a few minutes he was standing 
near the crack in the stone, breathing fresh air again. Onto Tristram.
                          ...........................................
	Meanwhile, in the hall of the Archbishop, there were six heaps of 
smoldering debris, where once stood six of the Holy Guard. Lazarus 
stood over the remains of the guards whom he had left responsible for 
Mardran.
	&#34;Fools!!! How could six of the finest of the Holy Guard allow 
the inept Mage to escape? Well, they've paid their price. Now the 
rest of you had better find Mardran or you'll suffer the same 
fate.&#34; bellowed Lazarus as he turned toward the line of Holy 
Guards assembled before him.
	Several cringed noticeably at those words.	
	&#34;Good, you had all best fear my wrath. For if Mardran isn't 
brought before me by the setting of the sun one day hence, you'll all 
suffer the same fate. Now go!!!!&#34; The Holy Guards did not require 
any additional motivation, they hurried from the room and began to 
plan their search.
	There was a sound as loud as a clap of thunder as the Archbishop 
slammed his staff down upon the Altar of Blood.
	In his eyes a look of apprehension.
                            
............................................
	Mardran slipped down the narrow alley between the two large brick 
buildings and emerged onto the town square. It was very late, but a 
few straggling adventurers milled about as if  lost. The Mage pulled 
the hood of his cape over his head, both as protection from the cold, 
but also to prevent his being recognized.
	He had traveled from the scene of his defeat at the hands of the two 
young rogues to the dungeons very quickly, quickly enough, he hoped, 
to have beaten the rogues and their new friend to Tristram. He knew 
of one sure way to discover if they were in town, he headed directly 
for Ogden's Tavern.
	Upon entering the tavern, he noticed that there were a significant 
number of strangers there. He lowered his head and slipped though the 
crowd and made his way to the bar. There he made a place for himself 
between two burly warriors.
	One of the warriors merely ignored him, while the other, wearing a 
bright red tunic, offered a slight grunting sound to acknowledge his 
presence.  He noticed that the crimson clad barbarian's mug was 
nearly empty.
	&#34;Care for another ale?&#34; he asked the warrior.
	&#34;Don't mind if I do!&#34; the barbarian replied with a big smile.
	&#34;An ale for me and refill my friend here&#34; Mardran called to 
the barkeep.
	&#34;You wouldn't be looking for work now would you?&#34; the Mage 
asked his new friend.
	&#34;What type of work did you have in mind? Working isn't exactly 
my cup of tea&#34; replied the warrior as he tried to size up the 
sorcerer.
	&#34;I need the help of a skilled swordsman. Do you know how to use 
that weapon at your side?&#34;
	&#34;I wouldn't be alive today if I didn't.&#34; roared the 
weathered looking barbarian. It was obvious to Mardran that this one 
had seen his share of action and was exactly what he needed to help 
him capture the girl.
	Mardran was trying to determine if this barbarian could be trusted. 
He decided to risk it and go straight to the point.
	&#34;I need to capture a girl and deliver her to Archbishop Lazarus. 
The Archbishop will reward us handsomely.&#34; he said, watching the 
eyes of the warrior for his reaction.
	&#34;How handsomely?&#34; was the barbarian's reply.
	&#34;Very, very handsomely!!&#34; Mardran said.
	Just then there drinks arrived. Mardran tossed a couple of gold 
coins of the counter and picked up his ale. He concentrated on the 
eyes of his companion.
	The barbarian  raised his mug and said, &#34;Looks like you have 
your sword!!&#34; Mardran noticed the tatoo of a serpent on the 
warrior's forearm. He wondered why a barbarian would want such a 
mark, but dismissed the thought and took a deep swig of his ale. He 
could now put his plan into motion.
