<pre>&#62; my mafia guild doesn't just allow you to play out your 
&#62; fantasy of being a big time gangster, but the Crimson
&#62; Alliance, with 1000 people will give you protectioon
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; LATE BREAKING NEWS: The Crimson Alliance has reached
&#62; at about 1000 members, don't be left out!!
&#62; i'm gonna take this opportunity to tell you about 
&#62; a really kewl ultima online guild that i would like
&#62; you to consider joining.  
&#62; 
&#62; the guild is called the UNDERGROUND WARLORDS.
&#62; we are an organized crime family in the game
&#62; ultima online. 
&#62;  
&#62; our clan is not a random pkilling clan like most of
&#62; the other's out there.  we live by a code of conduct, and
&#62; we are too sophisticated to kill people for no reason 
&#62; anyways.  guilds that just go around killing innocent
&#62; people are like street gangs.  we are trying to be more
&#62; like mafia type gangs.  our style is doesn't let us kill
&#62; unless we do it for business, or unless someone insults 
&#62; us.  the idea is that this is a role playing game, and it
&#62; should let you play the role of the people you always
&#62; wanted to imitate.  kinda like a holodeck.   
&#62; 
&#62; for business, we will run rackets, extort business owners,
&#62; run gambling rings, maybe even prostitution rings.  we will 
&#62; also do legal work like blacksmithing, of course.  we might
&#62; go up to a business owner and tell him that if he doesn't 
&#62; pay his protection money every week, we won't be able to
&#62; protect him, and bad things might happen.  hehehe.  
&#62; i was  thinking about getting a pirate group together,
&#62; and charge tariffs for other ships sailing our waters.
&#62; 
&#62; as for new members, we are looking for high quality 
&#62; players who will participate when the game comes out, and
&#62; will fit in with our family.  we have had 300+ applicants,
&#62; but so far, only about 85 people have been found to have
&#62; what it takes to join the family.  so as you can see, we
&#62; are putting a heavy emphasis on quality over quantity.
&#62; 
&#62; our webpage is <a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192">http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192</a>
&#62; trust me when i tell you that this is one of the best 
&#62; uo webpages out there.  it won an award for it too, and is 
&#62; maintained daily, so it is very up to date.  even if you decide
&#62; not to join us, i urge you to look at the page, it is really kewl.   
&#62; 
&#62; because we are trying to act out the parts of and organized
&#62; crime family, we need three things.  organization, crime, of 
&#62; course, and a sense of family.  through bulletin boards,
&#62; free chat programs... our guild members are very well 
&#62; connected  (excuse the pun  hehe).
&#62;  
&#62; we will live the good life like mafia people in the past,
&#62; like Al Capone, John Gotti...  we will have nice suits, 
&#62; and many women.  we will look down at all the pathetic
&#62; trashy losers that live in the city streets which we control,
&#62; and kids will look up to us as thier heroes.  maybe, if
&#62; business is good enough, we might do what capone
&#62; did, and open soup kitchens for the bums.  hehehe (who
&#62; ever said that the mafia was all bad?  we just want the
&#62; right to free enterprise, which the law really prohibits 
&#62; these days.)
&#62;    
&#62; so far, we have friendships with many other guilds,
&#62; and are allied with a few as well.  
&#62; 
&#62; come on, guys, join, and we'll take over the underworld!
&#62; 
&#62;                                               Urfriend  
&#62;                                              A.K.A.  Pkill_me
&#62; 
&#62; PS  WE HAVE JUST BECOME PART OF THE CRIMSON 
&#62; ALLIANCE, ONE OF THE MOST MOST POWERFUL
&#62; ALLIANCES IN UO!  The average guild in this alliance
&#62; has about 150-200 members, so with about 6 guilds, this 
&#62; alliance probably has about 900-1000 members.  and these
&#62; are high quality guilds who have people who actually 
&#62; participate too, so it will probably seem like even more 
&#62; than other alliances who just take anybody who might
&#62; not even play!
&#62; 
&#62; well, just come and look at out webpage at:
&#62; <a href="http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192">http://pages.nyu.edu/~bhh7192</a>
&#62; it can't hurt just to look at the page, and i promise
&#62; you, this is one of the better webpages out there!

most of the other guilds don't even talk with 
most of it's members, so many people kinda get bored 
and lose interest cuz they just don't feel involved.
we are working on a way to personally have ongoing
dialogues with all those who join, so everyone can
participate.  if you join some other guilds, you will get
one email message: &#34;congrats, accepted.&#34;  We are
working it out so we can email people regularly,
and individually, to keep everyone INformed, INvolved,
and INdecent.  just kidding about that indecent thing.  
hehe
