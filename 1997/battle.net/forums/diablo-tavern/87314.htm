<pre>       Hmmm, well I was paging back through the forum today, and came 
across my last post reply to ROWLF. AHAHHA, he still can't seem to 
figure out what a paragraph is, or even have one sinlge continuous 
thought.&#60;now here is where I change gears...note the paragraph 
ends&#62;
      ROWLF, yup...i am a backstabbing low life bastard....well 
actually I AM NOT but I play one in Diablo. I tis but a game, and I 
like to be the bad guy....but to tell the truth...I AM NOT THE BAD 
GUY anymore. You see ROWLF, I pretty much leave legits alone. I hunt 
dupers. OH WAIT! I forgot you don't think duping is wrong. OH well, 
anyway..I hunt players who have two times the Armor Class, HP, MANA, 
and Damage. Some I can't even do any damage to at all, so I try to 
get the monsters to do them in.Thing is that they have maybe one 
quarter the skill. They never develope the skill because they don't 
need to with all those dupes. Another reason duping is bad..justbad.  
&#60;end paragraph....in case you missed it ROWLF..&#62;
 
       Now, something occurred to me today. People are fond of saying 
that Pkilling has driven people into private games. I say it is 
cheating that has driven people into private games. This is why.
       Pkilling has been around since day one on Battle.net. Did 
everyone go running into private games in January? Hell no! We all 
just played the game...and kept our eyes open. Then the cheats and 
dupes rolled across Tristram in a great wave, and things changed.
       Now here pretty much what happened. People picked up all the 
cheats and became gods. These gods then started to pkill. Now these 
folks should not be called pk's at all...they should be called 
cheaters. Cheating pk's are the worst kind of cheater. They are what 
have driven folks into private games. Legit pks are few in number 
compared to the amount of little boys with godmode who kill. 99&#37; 
of those little boys could not kill anyone with out all of their 
cheats,hacks, and dupes. If the cheat programs and hacks and such 
never would have existed, there would be 99&#37; less pk's on bnet.
      So, don't lump plain old backstabbing bastard legit pk's like 
myself in with those poor excuses for skin aka cheating pks.
      Thanx 8)

PS. In case you don't know who ROWLF is..he believes that duping is 
not wrong , but at the same time believed that you could buy stuff 
back from Adria and Griswold after you sold it to them...... 
...........har har har.....

pss. ROWLF remember...PARAGRAPHS....try it!
     
&#34;I'm picking out a thermos for you.....&#34;</pre>
