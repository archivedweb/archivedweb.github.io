I want to stay.  I love INFERNO.  Anubisan could not decide.

I want to stay, Anubisan said he did not want to settle.  He wanted 
to quit to &#34;get me out of INFERNO.&#34;

Tracy, fist, I implore you..let me stay.  I love INFERNO, and would 
never be a traitor to it.  Anubisan just wants me out, and you guys 
WILL take him back.  I want us both to be in.  But he he can't stand 
me, have HIM leave.

I said over and over I was willing to be friends and say nothing to 
him, how hard could it be?  He did not trust me, Anubisan did not.  
So, he wanted us both out.

I ask, urge, everyone not to have me out because of his own faults.  
I want him to stay, but if he wants out so badly, he can go.  I like 
INFERNO too much to leave it.

Tracy, fist, redo that decision.  If you may.  I was the one willing 
to reconcile.  I should be allowed to stay.

And I WANT Anubisan in.  He will cool down.

Your choice.
