<pre>First topic:

The homepage for the Special Attack Division has been moved to:

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7601/">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7601/</a>

The reason I moved it is Netcom has absolutely no support for CGI 
scripts.  I have learned what I can about HTML and it is time to move 
on to the more &#34;complicated&#34; aspects of webpage design (hehe 
it isn't rocket science or anything).

Be sure to visit the site and read the first chapter of my biography. 
 I will be adding another chapter shortly as well as adding the 
biographies of fellow S.A.D. members. Of course, as I murder and 
steal from more pitiful slobs I will be adding more pictures to my 
&#34;Victims&#34; section.  Check these pages often for updates.

Second Topic:

Looks like Blizzard is open for business today since they have 
cleared the board of some rather offensive posts.  My question is, 
how many people were banned as a result?  I noticed that Cuda's post 
was removed as well as Anu's and Talon's.  I guess time will tell who 
(if anyone) was banned.
