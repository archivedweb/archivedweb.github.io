<pre>I posted the following message at another board and thought I'd share 
it here for anyone interested.  I apologize for it now being about 
Diablo, but with the shortage of any worthwhile games this summer, I 
feel obligated to share my enthusiasm.

I owe many thanks to some of my long time internet acquaintances that 
recently recommended a new game to me by the name of &#34;Dungeon 
Keeper&#34; made by Bullfrog, distributed by Electronic Arts.  While 
the picture on the box looks like it was made for 10 year olds, the 
game itself is extremely engaging.  I have not stopped playing it 
since I picked it up five days ago.  Its a combination SIM, RTS and 
Role Playing game.  You build dungeons consisting of many different 
types of rooms (ie: Liars, Treasure Rooms, Torture Chambers, Training 
Rooms, Prisons, Workshops, Temples, Graveyards, ect. ect).  As your 
Imps are chopping away at the earth you instruct them to dig, gold 
and gems are returned to your Treasure Room providing the needed 
funds to pay your troops and support the continued expansion of your 
Dungeon.   There are many different creatures, some of the coolest 
are Dragons, Skeletons, Warlocks, Deamon Spawns.   Vampires are 
created by ressurecting dead enemy creatures that your Imps drag into 
your Grave Yard.  hehe   My favorite may be the Dark Mistress.   Her 
name says it all and when you slap her she giggles.  I admit that's 
weird, but hey, its just a freakin game.  The fighting with the 
enemies is real time.  You can instruct the creatures where to go, 
what to do, and what weapons, at their desposal, to use.    Serial, 
IPX and Modem are supported for multiplayer, however, it runs like 
shit on kali, at least using the current 1.1r version.  I havent 
tried modem yet but I hear its not much of an improvement.   Word is 
that a patch is in the works to improve the multiplayer connection 
and add support for 3d accelerated cards like 3DFX.      I return 
many more games than I keep, but this game is definately a KEEPER.  
hehe, no pun intended.  Do yourselves a huge favour and pick up 
DUNGEON KEEPER.
