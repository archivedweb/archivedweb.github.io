<blockquote>
<pre>No one seemed to notice. No one really seemed to care that the 
recipient of the clan's highest honor didn't seem happy about it at 
all. They all cheered as the queen placed the medal around her neck, 
they made no recognition of the tear that escaped her overworked 
eyelids. Even if they had, they would have attributed it to memories 
of fallen comrades or the overwhelming emotion of the moment. Some 
might even have guessed that it might have to do with the overlooking 
of Shadowdancer for the award. But it was none of these.

How could she tell them that she didn't feel she deserved it? How 
could she try and make them understand what went through her head as 
her friends were killed? How it felt to watch as the vipers caught 
and killed Zster? The pain of doubt would always linger- if she had 
stopped running and stood to defend her friend, would it have made a 
difference? Reliving the moment over and over in her mind, she knew 
in her head that she could not have saved Zster, that stopping would 
have only ensured her death as well. But in her heart she couldn't 
help but wonder if it wasn't possible... if there was the slimmest 
chance to save her friend she should have done it. Perhaps then she 
was a downright coward...

But either way, it did not matter. She knew she was no hero. A hero 
does not return from battle without her friends. She was a survivor, 
and nothing more.
