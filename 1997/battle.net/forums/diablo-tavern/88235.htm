<pre>Well,
I care about what you are saying, but anyone with a family can 
probably relate to what I am about to say;

There is little enough time for my family, much less anything else.  
I work, and have a family and a home to keep up with, so when im not 
working at work, I am working at home, either in my yard, or 
something.  When you have kids, you realize that they are what is 
important, and you devote most of your time to caring for and loving 
them.  So I for one do think about and care about the issues you 
talked about, but unfortunately like Boingo do my little part and 
have no time for the rest.  I know this probably sounds bad, but my 
priorities are my own.

On a lighter note, Huntress!!!  I haven't seen you since we had that 
talk a month or so ago in the Snakegod channel.  We should hook up 
again and play sometime.  

BTW Diablo is one of the pleasures I take time to enjoy for myself!

&#62; The trouble is, Wiseman, that we are all influenced by our moods.  We

&#62; occasionally, and it is usually based on whatever's bringing us down 
&#62; in our own lives...  When we are happy, the world is wonderful...  
&#62; When we are down, we find depression in everything...  That is why we 
&#62; don't &#34;do&#34; anything about it, because we ourselves, 
&#62; subconsciously know that &#34;it will pass&#34;...  So we run away 
&#62; for the time being...  Into a computer game, into a book, into 
&#62; wallowing in our own depression, whatever...  Depression is sooo 
&#62; sweet, do you realise that?
&#62;   The more sensitive a person you are, the more you think for 
&#62; yourself, the more you feel the need to escape.  People who 
&#62; &#34;DO&#34; things, who play a part in &#34;doing things&#34;, are 
&#62; the ones who have the ability to &#34;feel less&#34;...  This is just 
&#62; a thought.  I am not sure if
&#62; it's the truth...  And guess what?  Whatever I think now, is 
&#62; influenced by my own depression...  By my own &#34;mood&#34;...</pre>
