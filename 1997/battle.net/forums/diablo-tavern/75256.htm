<pre>Wow, a lot of impostering was going on yesterday while I was busy 
building my new sexy-rogue(level 20).

TheMan, I don't know what the hell is going on but you are very very 
ignoring.  First of you made a lame story about Fluff-Bunny raping 
SnowRabbit, and secondly you made some sort of ANTI-Talon things...

I have to clear out one thing people, 
I DID NOT POST THAT RAPE POST.

If you think I did it, you are really stupid...
Why?
1.  I was on Battle.net since 8:30 am till 3 pm, building my sexy-
rogue..
2.  After 3pm I went out for work.
3.  I came back to home after 12' o clock, and went to B.net again.
( I went to the party..he he he...)

Ask SnowRabbit, he seen me in INFERNO channel after 12'o clock.

I did not post that message, if I did I'm really a gay.
I against gays ( I post about this in April).
I also against any sort of homo-sexual activities.

TheMan, you see I did not posted the thing, you might seen some 
elses, probably INFERNO's.

If you've ever seen my previous posts about adult language( in 
april), you have to notice that I said : 
&#34; I will not make more messages that contains sexual 
descriptions.&#34;
If you ever remember one of those posts, you have to be certain that 
previous eX-talon's post is not made by me.  Probably someone else.


I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAVE HAD HAPPENED....
After my restless attacks on INFERNO, theman is pissed off, because 
no-one wanted to join Map-makers.  Theman started to pick on me, 
because he think I'm just a racial minority, but I didn't care.  I 
said TheMan uses cheat, Theman gets angry and posted that idiotic 
rape/homo-xxx post.  That is what I think had happened.

Many people said &#34;3 post in 30 min??&#34;, well I have an answer 
for you:
First off, your ISP connection ask for your phone number/dial number. 
 Many people turned on as &#34;Default&#34;, in my case I believe 
that THEMAN's ISP host and my ISP host are the same.

And Also I don't even know this Fluff-Bunny, he probably a lame idiot 
like theman.  I don't make fun of other people unless I have evidence 
that will convince others.  Our merchants ARE powerful and INFERNO 
are just a little critters.

Do I know snowrabbit?  No, not that well; but that snow guy sure 
knows nothing about me.  I don't reply to snowrabbit, cause he is 
ignoring little fellow, he might be your friend but that doesn't mean 
he is my friend.  

See THEMAN, why should I post some stupid post like rape and homos??? 
 Get a life Little-Man...zzzzz...  
I hate you and You hate me, but don't ever make those kind of posts 
to amuse me, rape is not funny...You are mad about merchants aren't 
you???  once again, get a life.

So, if you hate me, just say I hate you.  Easy as that.  
If I get angry I just ignore what ever you do, not like posting 
sickening post like you.

If you know a little about This THEMAN, he is a cheater, high 
tempered, posting messages every 2 hours and a person who have no 
life at all.  He probably posted that idiotic messages to get rid of 
me for good, cause my merchant guild is taking away a lot of people 
from b.net.  TheMan is very zealousy man, ask Eugene/TGS, flux who 
ever might be.  I can't believe that someone actually uses my name...

Talon
I'm accused for nothing...I can't say more, you who've signed that 
petition are maybe bunch of INFERNO butt kissers.  You guys are doing 
it because you are afraid that INFERNO will get you back.  Cowards, 
you who think I really posted that message, you are probably sharing 
same low IQ as theman's....Have a good life with kissing butt of 
INFERNO.

p.s.  
That eX-Talon's post was disgusting, I mean I'm religious I do not 
post those stuffs on INTERNET...I almost throw up by reading half of 
that story...Good setup, TheMan..But some people did not follen in 
your trikc... ha ha ha...loser.</pre>
