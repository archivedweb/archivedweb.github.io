<pre>Just to confirm the above posts, I have found one suit of Awesome 
Full Plate
in normal hell, and bought one suit of Awesome Full Plate from Gris.  
This is
since February. It's hard to find/buy, and it seems harder now.  I 
haven't seen
any awesome full plate since v . 1.04 came out -- and I've been 
looking for it
 --  although Gris did sell me Saintly Full Plate of Sorcery a little 
while ago for about
137 K. I've never found any holy item, or better, and I've never seen
Godly or Holy Full Plate of any kind for sale. The best Godly item 
I've seen is
a Godly Gothic Shield of the Ages from Wirt  (+171&#37; -- dead 
minimum,
grr...)

I have found two Arch-Angels staffs, both in nightmare hell within a 
day of each
other. The second one was an aa staff of sorcery. So awesome and arch-
angel items can
definitely be found.

King's staff's cost an incredible amount  -- I found a King's
staff of chain lightning, and Adria offered about 87K for it.  In 
another post,
someone reported that Adria offered about 250 K for a King's staff of 
blood
star!

I've never seen Wirt, Gris, or Adria demand more than 140 K either .
Does anyone know for sure whether they just don't sell more valuable 
items
(in which case you could never buy  Godly Full Plate of the Whale, or 
a
King's war staff of Chain Lightning for that matter), or if they cap 
their asking price
at 140 K, or whatever? There was a discussion of this in the Strategy 
Forum,
but it seemed to be based more on hypothesis than actual facts.

If it is really true that you can't find GPOW and you can't buy it, 
then Eugene
has an interesting point...

Bliz stated at least twice in Tech Support that Kings bows ARE  
possible. But I
believe the chance of finding/buying them must be so small that it's 
essentially
negligable. There was also a reliable-looking post from an old time 
player who
had found two pieces of emerald jewelry. But, again, maybe it was 
easier to find
in earlier versions.

On Wirt's pricing, Wirt and Gris both recently offered me a Long War 
Bow of the
Heavens (+15 to all) --- Gris asked 60 K and Wirt asked 90 K for the 
identical item.
So Wirt asks 50&#37; more than Gris. When the Wirt &#34;bug&#34;  was 
operational, you
could still buy it at Gris's price. (Personally, I don't consider 
that avoiding Wirt's
price gouging was cheating -- I'd flat out rob him if I could --
and I don't have any stake in this, since I only tried bargaining 
with Wirt after he
stopped doing it.)

In general, you have to be careful of making blanket assumptions 
about non-hacked
items. There are a lot of people logging a lot of Diablo hours, and 
sometimes they
do legitimately find very good and very unusual items.</pre>
