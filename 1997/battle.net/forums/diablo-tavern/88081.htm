<pre>	Yes that is right.. my level 50 IS legit.. it didnt take long 
actually, I had my 3rd rogue which I used a lot more than this one at 
level 43 in 1.00 and this one at 49 in 1.02 when I retired it (I 
played a lot more back then) When I brought it back on bnet last 
month I was called a cheater because of the level and my acct.. well 
after 2 system crashes one which was because my system didnt like 
patch 1.03 the other I forget.. my acct is at about 569000 and its 
kinda hard not to call someone with a high acct a cheater if they 
have a high level.. I understand that.. but.. why does it 
automatically come up as &#34;they have a cheat site therefore they = 
cheater&#34;?
	I dont use the hacks I make except to test them and it is ONLY on a 
test character that never comes on battle.net.  I am not stupid 
enough to hack my character then bring it on bnet :)  Anyway back to 
the subject... When you reach level 48 you are getting about 8 or 9k 
exp per kill in hell hell not just certain monsters at 49, a little 
more exp per kill, 50, you get 10k exp per kill.. thats ANY monster 
in hell hell.. dont believe that BS about you not getting exp because 
its just wrong.  I have played this game probably longer than anyone 
that is still on battle.net.. hell my first acct was 511 (damn crash 
make me MAD).
	When you get to 50 you dont stop getting exp, you dont only get exp 
from some monsters, you dont go to the COW LEVEL, you just keep 
playing like normal.. granted you do see nicer things for sale but 
thats another story.  Howd I get that high in 1.02?  Well its called 
nothing else to do.. I was out of school and didnt have to do 
anything around the house so I came on bnet.. and since the game is 
so addicting, I ended up playing about 6 or more hours a day (usually 
9 heheh).  And now that the game is BORING I have nothing else to do 
so I either find out new hacks or I edit my website ( 
<a href="http://evince.tierranet.com/soul/">http://evince.tierranet.com/soul/</a> ) or sit and eat :)
	I am just tired of hearing the strange crap about level 50 and 
calling people cheats and such.. also YES BLIZZARD MADE THE GAME 
BUT... they dont play like some people do so they dont know EXACTLY 
how long it takes to get to 50.. they just guess.  ALSO, they say 
that you only get exp from some monsters.. well I havent seen any 
LEGIT level 50's saying they dont get exp for some monsters.. maybe 
blizzard means you dont get exp in normal or nightmare hell.. I dunno.
