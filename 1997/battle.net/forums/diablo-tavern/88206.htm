&#62; Hiya People,
&#62;         I just went to the Lohlander site, and went to the radio 
&#62; station.  There were some great songs there, and this one was forming 
&#62; itself in my head. Hope you like reading it as much as I liked 
&#62; writing it.
&#62; 
&#62; Diablo's been good to me so far.
&#62; Parody of : Life's been good to me.
&#62; Apologies go out to Joe Walsh, for this cut up version of his song.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I got a stormshield forget the price.
&#62; I never use it, they tell me it's nice.
&#62; I play diablo, kill all the cheaters,
&#62; I have a psycologist, she tells me I'm fine.
&#62; 
&#62; They say I'm Crazy but I have a good time.
&#62; I'm just looking for clues like a G-P-O-W.
&#62; Diablo's been good to me so far.
&#62; 
&#62; My kings sword of slaying does over 85.
&#62;  I lost it to lag, now I don't fight.
&#62; I play a sorcerer, fight in the back.
&#62;  I use a mana shield in case I'm attacked.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm writing stories, my fans they can't wait.
&#62; They write me e-mail, tell me I'm great.
&#62; So I got me ICQ #1258909.
&#62; Just send a message, maybe I'll reply.
&#62; 
&#62; Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through.
&#62; Killed by gods more than a time or two.
&#62; I can't complain but sometimes I still do.
&#62; Diablo's been good to me so far.
&#62; 
&#62; I go to chat rooms sometimes until 7.
&#62; It's hard to leave when you can't find alt-F4.
&#62; It's hard to handle this reputation of evil.
&#62; Everybody's so different I haven't changed.
&#62; 
&#62; They say I'm lazy, but Diablo takes all my time.
&#62; I keep on playing and I think I know why.
&#62; Diablo's been good to me so far.

Keep up the cool posting and I'll be listening to WLOH for this and 
future songs!!
