&#62; Well since I &#34;forgot&#34; to go to class today I've had time to 
&#62; go and check out some of our member sites with scrutiny.  I've also 
&#62; been reading some of our posts here at Ogden's (damn Rikor...you're 
&#62; funny!).  All of the sites were very well done and are nice 
&#62; representations of our clan.  Lepthana deserves a nod of recognition 
&#62; for taking the 3 guild idea and running with it....Saturday should 
&#62; finish things up. 
&#62;      Now as most of you know...I have many friends that are &#34;bad 
&#62; guys&#34; since I was with Inferno for so long.   Even after I joined 
&#62; Snakegod, I continually got questions about who my affiliation will 
&#62; be once UO comes out and my generic answer was &#34;I'll have to play 
&#62; it and decide then&#34;.  Well, I've actually made up my mind 
&#62; already.  When UO is finally public (I'm not a beta tester) I'm 
&#62; sticking with Snakegod.  Being a good little warrior has been a 
&#62; helluva lot more fun and more fullfilling.  The clan is filled with 
&#62; great people and I'm looking forward to continuing our ongoing 
&#62; relationship for many, many months ahead.   So with all that long-
&#62; winded stuff said and done....I just wanted to send out a big THANKS 
&#62; to all our members for making this guild a fun, happy place to be on 
&#62; b.net.
&#62;                                Kariyafan
&#62; 
&#62; PS &#34;oh geez, somebody get the ambassador a tissue!&#34; 

&#60;passes the esteemed ambassador a tissue&#62;
Kari,

Thanks for the kind words. I'm glad to hear that if and when we all 
become involved in UO, you will remain with us.

I have encountered much the same feelings since joining Snakegod. It 
saved Diablo as a game for me, I was ready to quit.

I have begun to test UO, there have been a lot of problems the last 
few days with their servers. It has also been very, very slow and 
that's when I go in through the T1 at work during lunch, so I'm not 
sure what to expect via modem.

Speaking of modems, how's that new working for you, seeing less 
hourglass these days?
