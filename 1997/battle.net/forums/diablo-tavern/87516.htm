<pre>Greetings b-net denizens!

Guess what I found here in Krakow? One of those newfangled &#34;cyber-
cafes&#34; that'll give you access to the web for just 2 zloty an 
hour (60 cents). They even serve you beer as you type. Now THAT'S 
service!

Anyway, I checked my hotmail account and got a mailbox-full of 
messages about some offshoot of Inferno. So I decided to use my 
remaining time to come and check out my favorite soap op ... I mean 
message board! Hey, it's something to help keep me entertained until 
I come back in August. Anyway, here are my thoughts on what I've seen 
and the choices I've had to make.

Quite a lot of people know that I've been deeply unhappy with Inferno 
for some time.

First of all, I'm sick of proven cheaters -- like Flux -- clinging to 
membership and making the rest of Inferno look like liars and 
hypocrites. I've seen Flux use hacks. I've seen her dupe. And yet she 
remains. Now I read that one of the supposed TO's cheats too? What 
happened to being a &#34;legit PK guild&#34; ... which is why I 
joined in the first place?

Second, I see that TheMan has reacquired Inferno membership. I have 
no particular problem with that. However, he has immediately reverted 
to the very same behavior that earned him his expulsion eariler: 
picking fights, backing away from duels and arrogating authority to 
himself. Apparently he has learned nothing.

Meanwhile, I find that Haplo is strutting around as a TO. Correct me 
if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same person who quit Inferno after 
TheMan was booted -- in favor of KoR? Even worse, according to 
Mikedog and Torquemeda, this new leader has found it necessary to 
cheat in order to save his bacon in a duel. Sorry, but these are not 
the type of &#34;leaders&#34; that anyone could reasonably be 
expected to respect!

Third, I see that the remaining members of Inferno are snapping at 
each other over the scraps of remaining &#34;power&#34;. Think what 
you will of Flux, but who can read Haplo's post &#34;putting her in 
her place&#34; and not be nauseated at its tone of childish one-
upmanship? Gee, I guess this is too far beyond what &#34;little 
people&#34; like me can understand.

Issues and petty conflicts like these have had me on the verge of 
quitting Inferno for months, but I have always been restrained by the 
desire not to hurt those good, legit and fun people who would remain.

Now I find that nearly all those great people who kept me in Inferno 
have shed their old, somewhat tarnished affiliations in order to 
create the new PoC -- players like Morte, Tracy, Fist, Elijah, 
Curunir, SnowRabbit and Torquemeda. The PoC has also attracted some 
pretty impressive former &#34;independents&#34;, such as Eugene (!), 
Blz and Possum.

The players in the PoC seem to have grasped that this is a GAME ... 
you know, a fun thing to do with people you know and like. No tinpot 
dictators. No &#34;master plans&#34;. No disgusting little power 
games.

So it turns out that there really isn't that much of a choice for me. 
Toss me a robe, Brothers! Await my return in August, for then we 
shall preach the true meaning of Chaos!

&#34;Yep, another 2 zloty well spent :)&#34;</pre>
