&#62; Hello
&#62; I'm here to discuss strategy with someone. I'm not stuck on any 
&#62; particular level but it would be nice not having to keep on doing 
&#62; trial and error. I have quiet a few weapons like Griswold's edge
&#62; and the Bastard sword but haven't found anything particularly good 
&#62; except the moon ring and staff of town portal.
&#62; Now back to my questions.
&#62; 1.  I want to know if you use an attack and run method to draw out 
&#62; the monsters from the groups they stay in because this worked quite 
&#62; well for me up to this point.
&#62; 2.  I have yet to encounter King Leoric's tomb and according to the 
&#62; GOSSIP from griswold, he created armour for the king.  I have the 
&#62; King's Valor suit and now need head gear protection.  According to 
&#62; my theory once I defeat the king I'll get his crown for protection.
&#62; I am on the twelfth dungeon level and haven't seen the tomb yet. Will
&#62; I encounter the tomb. I've also heard that the skeletons that protect 
&#62; his tomb come back to life too.
&#62; Thanks for your time.

Hello,

To answer question 1:

I usually play a Warrior. I have found that on the harder 
difficulties especially, this is the BEST method. If you play another 
character type this method may be good at times but not always. I 
know it can be time consuming, but I have been able to beat every 
level on every difficulty by myself (solo) using this method.


To answer question 2:

If you are playing a single player game, not every quest is available 
in every game. If you are on level 12 that quest is not in your game. 
I'm not sure what level the Skeleton King is on in single player, but 
in multi-player it is on level 3. Single player it should be near the 
same level.

Hope this helps!!
