<blockquote>
<pre>I don't think the question is, can you get to level 50? The question 
is, can you do it in so short a time as TheMan claims to have done? I 
don't remember exactly how long ago he turned 49 (does someone?), but 
it was about two weeks ago if I recall correctly. Now I've put in 
some serious playing time in the last two weeks, and only got about 
two-thirds of the way from 41 to 42 in that time. But then, only in 
the last few days have I been serious about trying to gain XP. 

TheMan says that at level 49 you get about 10 XP per kill. I don't 
know how much XP it takes to go from level 49 to 50, but let's say 
it's 200 million. Ok, to be conservative, let's say 100 million. This 
means that you'd need to kill 10 million baddies to do it. If TheMan 
killed one guy per second (a pretty liberal estimate for a warrior, 
factoring in stops to reload belt and trips to town), 24 hours a day, 
that'd take him 115 days (nearly four months) to do this. To do it in 
8 hours a day, like he says he did, it would take 345 days, or about 
a year. To do it in two weeks, he'd have to have played 197 hours a 
day. 

Using his other estimate, that you get 10K per Hell/Hell clear, if he 
could clear Hell/hell in two hours (again, a liberal estimate for 
anyone... especially a warrior who insists on using a Grandfather, 
which can't stun witches and mages), that'd be 40K XP a day. Thus 
it'd take him 250 days (8 months) to accumulate 100 million XP (or 
just 85 days if he did it 24 hours a day). To do this in two weeks, 
he'd have to have played 143 hours a day. 

TheMan, I'm not trying to be mean to you. I'm not prosecuting you, 
I'm defending the bragging rights of true high level legits. If you 
can show me my arithmetic error here and prove that you are in fact a 
legit 50, then I will say that you are in fact a Diablo God (I will 
bow down to anyone who can get to 50!). However, it would seem 
mathematically to be nearly impossible that anyone could have done it 
in the amount of time that's passed since January 6, let alone since 
June 6. 

Please TheMan, point out my mistake. If you're legit, I must've made 
an obvious one (or maybe the data you gave me to work with had a 
margin of error of 246&#37;). If you're not legit, you'll simply 
reply with a &#60;no text&#62; at the end of your subject, or maybe 
stop and take the time to show me you care by mindlessly flaming me.
