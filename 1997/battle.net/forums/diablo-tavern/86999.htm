<pre>Your desperate act against me are very entertaining.
You guys should be on the movie.

I'm sorry but, you guys lose.  
I could not find any legit players today morning.  I joined 15 games 
today, yet I found not a single legit ones.  Ofcourse, if I compare 
the 5000 players I might be wrong, or bad luck. 
But I met over 40 people, yet they were all duped cheaters.  

I think not many people want to be a legit.  I only see fairly few 
legits around in ogdens too.  

From my last post, I expected some good counterattack on my 
beliefs...Yet, only Tal' gave me some reasonable thoughts, others 
were garbage.  

I think I can only argue with Tal' for my beliefs.



(only tal has right to answer my writings...you may allowed to read)
To Tal':  
Why I protect-CHEATERs, even though I'm legit?  I will give the 
answer, Cheaters act clean and do not PK.  Ofcourse, I cannot 
represent all of the cheaters in B.net, BUT most cheaters just use 
duped stuff.  Very few cheaters uses god-mode or trainers.  I only 
met 5 pkillers out of 40 cheaters today.  

Ofcourse, you can't stop cheat.  I do not recommand cheat for others, 
but I do not stop them from cheating either.  If you get the point, 
we can't to anyting about cheat.  That is my plot.  

 --YOU CAN'T DO A THING--

My major plot is that &#34;CHEAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED&#34;, even 
Blizzard told us that.  Some people dislike cheat, but that doesn't 
mean other shouldn't.  People have choice to cheat.  Yet you people 
are saying &#34;CHEATERS ARE CORRUPTING THE B.nET!&#34;, I agree.  
But if you can't go along with the flow of fashion, you are only one 
who would be left alone.  

See, PEOPLE HAVE CHOICE.  You can't make THEM to do things that you 
want them to.  Now, YOU LOSE.  

Many people chose their way to become a cheater, they love cheat.  
They love what they are doing.  Let them be what they want to be.  
But what you are saying is that WE &#34;MUST&#34; end the cheat, vert 
few accepted your words.  I'm neutral, I'm just defending the RIGHT 
of the cheaters.  

If you don't like the public games, then join some sort of guild.  
Don't tell CHEATERS what to do, they are not your slaves.  

B.net was ment to be a place where people gather around and have fun 
and become friends (or just a marketing plot from Blizzard).  I do 
agree with PKilling, fine with me, since most of my friends were 
Pkillers anyway.  Some people think that if you get killed by a 
cheater, you become a loser.  No, I got kill alot by cheaters, yet I 
don't complain.  Maybe your view of CHEATER-PK and my view of CHEATER-
PK are different.  Result is the same &#34;YOU DIE&#34;.  

What's the difference??  You die anyway~~
You might say, &#34;CHEATERS HAS GREAT ADVANTAGE!!&#34;, I agree.  
But only thing you lose will be your 10 gold pieces worth ear. 
(+ half of your gold) 

See, cheating or no cheating ends the same.  


Many people who complain about cheating are Player-Killers.  But 
don't you remember the days when you pkilled more than 100 players 
per day??  Just think today as your pay back.  Ofcourse, you pkilled 
people with your incredible backstabbing skills, now those people 
whom you killed are coming back with their god-mode to end your 
laughs.  You might say &#34;but I killed him LEGITly, not 
cheating&#34;.  Well, you killed themm right?  And the guy got killed 
want to revenge, right?  It doesn't matter to them what they use, as 
long as you die just like they did. 

You killed innocent people.  Now those innocent people are cheating 
to get their revenge.  Those CHEATER-PK are using same things as you 
legit-PK did, &#34;KILL FOR NO REASONS&#34;.  So if you get killed by 
CHEATER with no reasons, don't complain to cheaters, complain to 
LEGIT-PKs.  
I don't, WHY SHOULD YOU??! 
(From: Anti-CHEATING.  &#34;WHY DO YOU CHEAT, I DON'T&#34;)


Get some decent COUNTERATTACKS PEOPLE...
I'm waiting.....


S-R.  
If you have insulted me before, do not even repost, I won't read it,  
nor anyone else, cause its all same thing &#34;TALON, YOU SUCK&#34;.</pre>
