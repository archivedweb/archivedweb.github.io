<pre>wow, you know, i come here upon occasion to look at whats happenng, 
or what people are discussing, but, umm, i know its been since late 
march since the diablo cd was even remotely near my pc tower, but why 
these personal attacks on people?

i started as a Pkiller myself, i basically targeted &#34;hot 
shots&#34; who thought they were good. sometimes i actually won :-)

but then cheating became so much of a problem, my ear was owned by 
half the Bnet populace.

Now, i remember inferno waaaay back then, i once went to their 
channel and asked to join, but recived nothing but insults from some 
gentleman who i believe was named fistanditlus.that left a sour taste 
in my mouth and i didn't go back to that group. i remained a 
&#34;wandering soul&#34; until i heard of the realm, and started 
playing there.

now that i have retruned to internet gaming, i have pretty much 
renounced my PK ways, (although not my dueling ways) and attempted to 
find a half decent guild here on Bnet.

Much to my dismay, i found no such grouping.well, except ordo rosae 
moriatur, which i have just now signed on with for illusia.(great 
game by the way..though battle DOES tend to get verrrrrrry boring)

as for this weird stuff going on between TheMan and this Eugene 
fellow, its all uneccasary, i say, if you dont like someone, kill 
him, or just leave that person alone.Back in the glory days of 
diablo, i remember when clan Avatar and the order of shaa (my 
guild..hehe..we had 18 members) would conduct mock wars, and if 
someone had a problem with someone else, that was where we settled 
it, right then and there.....mabye thats what you guys need, an all 
out war to see who should shut up, and who should be bragging..not 
only will it solve a lot, its very relaxing. (wink wink)

and another thing, any guilds here in Bnet feel like taking an old 
man like me? be warned, i do tend to go overboard on my role 
playing.however, all my characters have been erased..Val,Herc,Pheles, 
all my war god creations gone :-(

life sucks, then you die, right?
