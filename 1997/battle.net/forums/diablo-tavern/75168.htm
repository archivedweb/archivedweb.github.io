INFERNO are.  
Q:  You mean that there is a possibilty that Merchant Guild will be 
succumb/join to INFERNO?

THEMAN.  I will gonna flame THEMAN in U.O.

Q:  Why do you hate THEMAN?
A:  Uh...I think THEMAN is a cheater and many people does not like 
him either.  I hate him because he is the only person who posts 8 
ANTI-TALON posts everyday.


Q:  You seems to know so much of Diablo Hacking, do you hack?
A:  Ofcourse, I hack.. :)   But I do not hack on my characters.  I 
use hack to improve my hex-editing skills.
Q:  How do you Hex-Edit?
A:  You need a scientific calculator that has HEX switch buttons, and 
a programming tools such like C++(beginners).
Q:  Can C++ hack Diablo?
A:  Probably won't.  But I didn't tried with C++ yet.

A:  I against cheat.  I hate to see people using god-mode... I can't 
pkill!

Talon 

p.s.
I have to clear out one thing.  I'm not a person who says 
&#34; INFERNO SUX&#34;

I use specific target to pick on, not a whole group.  INFERNO is 
actually a good group of people, except some people like THEMAN.


IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT ME, POST REPLY SO EVERYONE CAN SEE.  
I WILL REPLY THEM ON WEDNESDAY.
