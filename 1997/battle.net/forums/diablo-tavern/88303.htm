<blockquote>
<pre>Upon arriving back in town, Pepin is nearly attacked by 
Warriors, Rogues, and Wizards alike. Some of them were lying 
on the ground, pools of blood surrounding them. The dead and 
the dying were everywhere. &#34;Please.. You have to help my 
friend.&#34;, begs one warrior. His friend lying on the ground 
unconscious, severely bleeding from an open wound in his 
chest. Pepin, turning away with tears streaming down his face, 
&#34;I'm sorry, my friends, I can no longer heal you.&#34;
&#34;What do you MEAN you can no longer heal us?&#34; The Warrior 
stands up, shouting. &#34;How can you refuse to heal my friend?&#34;
&#34;LOOK at him. Only YOUR healing can save him. You MUST 
save him!&#34;
&#34;I'm not refusing to heal. I CAN&#34;T heal anymore&#34; Pepin 
shouts 
back. &#34;I've lost my ability to heal people.&#34;
Pepin turns away and walks back to his hut, head bowed down 
and unable to control his emotions any longer.
&#34;It's true, you know, he really can't heal your friend. Or anyone 
else, for that matter.&#34; Looking sympathetically at the Warrior. 
&#34;I'm sorry about your friend. I really am. But have you noticed 
something's different? None of Pepin's magic works anymore. 
And Adria's dead.&#34; There was stunned silence at this remark. 
&#34;Someone killed her and stole her heart, literally. Pepin can't 
even resurrect her.&#34;
&#34;What do you mean Adria's dead?&#34; Several people almost 
shout in unison. &#34;She can't be dead.&#34; A mage continues. 
&#34;I mean, I just saw her not more than 20 minutes ago, very 
much alive. I bought this staff from her.&#34; The mage hands me 
the staff. Upon closer examination, I recognize this staff as a 
Plentiful Staff of Fireball. Looking at the runes on the staff, I 
notice they still appear to be active. &#34;Stand back. Everyone
please stand back for a moment.&#34;  Raising the staff, saying the
activation word for the staff. A huge ball of flame erupts from 
the staff shooting into the sky.

&#34;WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS DEVICE OF YOURS CAN'T BLOCK 
THE MAGIC INSCRIBED INTO STAVES?&#34; Roars Diablo. 
&#34;I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WILL DISRUPT ALL MAGIC.&#34;
&#34;Umm.. Well.. My Lord, I meant it as a figure of speech.&#34; 
 &#34;A FIGURE OF SPEECH&#34; shrieks Diablo. 
&#34;I WANT ALL MAGIC TO STOP WORKING... NOW!&#34; 
&#34;I will see what I can do my Lord.&#34; 
&#34;YOU WILL DO IT OR YOU WILL FEED MY HOUNDS.&#34;
&#34;GET OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I RIP YOUR HEART OUT. GO!&#34; 
Diablo's slave slowly slips out of the room wondering how he
was going to get magic to stop working with that magical 
faery wood.


Well here's part 2. Tell me what you think
