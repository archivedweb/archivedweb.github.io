<pre>I am sick and @#$&#37;ing tired of B.Net.
No, I'm not complaing about cheaters, or Pkers, or BadBoys or anyone 
else for that matter. I am pissed off at Blizzard.

Is it just me, or has Blizzard let B.Net turn into crap? Something 
that was once a great place to go and talk with your friends and play 
a nice game has been destroyed - by lag.
Let me tell you a little story.
Just now, I logged onto B.Net. Being a member of Inferno, I went to 
the Inferno channel. I was welcomed by 17 - count it, 17 - lag 
ghosts. These people serve no purpose but to take over OP status, let 
any jack-ass in the channel, and annoy the hell out of the channels 
regular inhabitants. After that, some REAL people joined the channel. 
Getting ready to join a game, me and my companions whispered each 
other to get the game and pass set. Now, I swear to GOD, it must of 
taken at least 2 minutes for my whisper to reach my friends, and vice-
versa. Thanks to that, I did not get the game and pass until they 
were already in the game. Therefore, I could not ask for Pass 
verification. So, I decided to try and join the game. Y'know what 
happened? I couldn't even access the join game screen!!!! I had to 
CTRL-ALT-DEL it out of Diablo, for lag had wounded and devoured my 
beloved computer.

Now, I usually go on here and bitch on how I hate cheaters and say 
that they ruin the game. They do, but not as much as our No. 1 foe.

      @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@THAT FOE IS LAG!!!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

And what is Blizzard doing about it? NOTHING!!!! Nothing at all. Has 
anyone heard a peep out of them about this supposed new patch? I sure 
the hell have heard rumors - and that's what it is, rumors. I'd hate 
to see a great game go to hell, thanks to lag, but it looks like it 
might. And this problem is for everyone. Voice your opinion on this, 
please.
