<blockquote>
<pre>  Eugene just another random PK?  Won't be remember while coopers the 
likes of you will go down in history?  YEAH RIGHT.

  FYI Eugene is probably the first or second best known poster on 
this board.  Certainly he is the best known PK (that's real PK, not 
some pseudo PK like TM).  You might also want to know that Eugene's 
PK/Dueling page is so famous even members of those so-called 
respectable coop guilds took his advice on dueling.  He has by far 
the best page on how to kill other players on the Internet.

  Before you say that the people in channel tech support know more 
about this game, you might want to think about something.  How do 
they know so much about the game if they just sit in the channel all 
day?  Sure they might be able to resolve some hardware/software 
issues, but that comes mostly from knowing about computers in general.

  Eugene on the other hand would always be playing when he was on 
b.net.  Of all the players I have met he spent the least time 
chatting.  Every time I would see him he would either be in a game or 
message me for a quick equipment transfer so he could go back to 
playing.  As a result of this Eugene has the more knowledge about 
this game than anyone I have met.  As far as knowing character stats 
and stategies, you would be hard pressed to beat him.

  But what about you, dear malara?  Who will remember you when you 
leave?  I doubt very many.  Sure a few of your Ogden's friends will 
remember you, but what about Diablo players in general?

  I think what we have here is a case of jealousy and spite.  Malara 
is obviously disturbed by the fact that Eugene is so well known and 
others like herself go unnoticed for the most part.

See?  I don't claim to be the best all the time......I'll leave that 
to Eugene</pre>
