&#62; Ok ok, I promise to stop after this one, but I think it applies to 
&#62; some people in here.
&#62; ------------------------
&#62; If I ever become an Evil Overlord:
&#62; 
&#62;   1. My legions of terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass 
&#62; visors,  not face-concealing ones.
&#62; 
&#62;   2. My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.
&#62; 
&#62;   3. My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not 
&#62; kept  anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.
&#62; 
&#62;   4. Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies.
&#62; 
&#62;   5. The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on 
&#62; the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the 
&#62; Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box.
&#62; 
&#62;   6. I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing 
&#62; them.
&#62; 
&#62;   7. When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and 
&#62; asks, &#34;Or are you afraid without your armies to back you up?&#34; 
&#62; My reply will be, &#34;No, just sensible.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62;   8. When I've captured my adversary and he says, &#34;Look, before 
&#62; you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?&#34; 
&#62; I'll say, &#34;No.&#34; and shoot him.
&#62; 
&#62;   9. After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married 
&#62; immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in 
&#62; three weeks time during which the final phase of my plan will be 
&#62; carried out.
&#62; 
&#62;   10. I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely
&#62;   necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button 
&#62; labelled &#34;Danger: Do Not Push&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62;   11. I will not order my trusted lieutenant to kill the infant who is
&#62;   destined to overthrow me -- I'll do it myself.
&#62; 
&#62;   12. I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a 
&#62; small hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.
&#62; 
&#62;   13. I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no 
&#62; need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving 
&#62; my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.
&#62; 
&#62;   14. I will not waste time making my enemy's death look like an 
&#62; accident:  I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies 
&#62; wouldn't believe it.
&#62; 
&#62;   15. I will make it clear that I DO know the meaning of the word 
&#62; &#34;mercy&#34;; I simply choose not show them any.
&#62; 
&#62;   16. One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any 
&#62; flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before
&#62; implementation.
&#62; 
&#62;   17. All slain enemies will be cremated, not left for dead at the 
&#62; bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any 
&#62; accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the 
&#62; aforementioned disposal.
&#62; 
&#62;   18. My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as 
&#62; members of my organization, nor will they be required to wear 
&#62; military boots or adhere to any other dress codes.
&#62; 
&#62;   19. The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or 
&#62; any other form of last request.
&#62; 
&#62;   20. I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I 
&#62; find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to 
&#62; activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting 
&#62; his plan into operation.
&#62; 
&#62;   21. I will design all doomsday machines myself. If I must hire a mad
&#62; scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is sufficiently 
&#62; twisted to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the damage 
&#62; he's caused.
&#62; 
&#62;   22. I will never utter the sentence &#34;But before I kill you, 
&#62; there's just one thing I want to know.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62;   23. When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to 
&#62; their advice.
&#62; 
&#62; NOW get to work! :-D
