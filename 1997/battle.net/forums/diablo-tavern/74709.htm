<pre>It's a great idea, Fryl, but the thought of it makes me sad.  It's 
true that some folks are burning out on Diablo and fading into the 
woodwork, I know, but I hate to have some formal way of killing off 
characters, because it's almost an incentive for folks NOT to return.

I love the idea of inter-group play.  I've played as many games with 
Snakegod and Ordo folks over the last few weeks as I've played with 
Tarot.  I'm all for organized cross-over nights and even shared 
passwords among the honorable clans.  I've never been to Hell/Hell 
(after all this time I'm still level 32), but I'd love to wander down 
there and test my mettle with the other players that I like so well.  
I just don't want to &#34;die.&#34;  I've played this game off and on 
since the beginning of the year with one character, and I still have 
enough fun with it to NOT want to pledge the death of my character to 
the Alignment.  I realize that the &#34;death&#34; aspect adds a lot 
to the tension of the Alignment and that for some folks it will be a 
fitting farewell tour.  But I'm also afraid that some folks who fall 
will indeed honor the death pact (much different than the folks who 
announce that they're leaving BNet for GOOD every other week), and 
for those folks, they'll shut the door on the game forever.  To me, 
that means less of the good folks and less of the old-timers, which 
makes me sad.

I'll play, I'll fall pretty early (I guarantee it), and I'll even use 
it as a goodbye to friends who are leaving forever....but I can't 
take that last step myself.  I'm not yet ready to go, and I hope that 
the players you listed can think of a way to stick around, too.  
Let's get together and share passwords and games...and leave it at 
that.</pre>
