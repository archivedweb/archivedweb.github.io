<pre>Something I've been noticing lately, is a steady waning of popularity 
for this familiar character.
I used to come here, and notice his posts.  And notice that other 
people had too, from the number of flames and responses.  But ya 
know, seems to me that less people care about what he has to say.  
Maybe he should find a new forum.  Or leave and comeback after a 
while with a less annoying personality.

So you made 50.  Yeehaa, I made lvl 37.  And playing 8 hours a day 
(yes I did read his last post), well that is definately lame.
I dont usually play even 4 hours in a week.

The 20's and 30's are more fun anyway.  Fun to kill, fun to pk, fun 
to play coop and actually have a hard time getting by Laz.

So you made 50.  I could care less.  If its as legit as you say, good 
for you.  If it ain't: well, you know the way out.

Okay so this is sort of to The Man, but he don't need, get, or 
deserve no more attention.  Not from here atleast.

- Solace (INDEPENDANT)

 ... for now, that's enough.  Besides, what kind of guild needs 
people who play coop one game, and then shoot a dozen fireballs at 
your back the next?  Be unpredictable.
