<pre>First things first. How many can actually claim they have read the 
posting guidelines??? A review for you then:

Blizzard provides these forums as a service for our customers to 
discuss our latest games.  Although we advocate free speech, we will 
not tolerate abusive or offensive posts on our site.  Some examples 
include:

            - Use of profanity

            - Personal attacks on other users

            - Attacks on other groups (ethnic, religious, etc.)

Users who violate these posting guidelines may be banned from this 
site, without prior warning, at the sole discretion of Blizzard

I find it rather bad that people continue to incessantly abuse each 
other in this forum. This is a game!! This forum is for discussion 
and stories about Diablo. I think that a lot of the problems that 
occur here is because of the immaturity of a lot of Diablo players. 
Yes kids it's reaaaaaaally great to abuse people.....geeez grow up 
some please.

I have no problem with debates &#34;To PK or not to PK etc&#34;, but 
when it just comes down to abuse, it is pathetic.

Have you ever stopped to think &#34;Am I really having fun? Am I 
doing it at someone elses expense? Will they be hurt some way by my 
actions?&#34; I doubt it, because that would be a sign of maturity.

Now don't get me wrong, this does not apply to everyone. I am not 
saying we should all be a bunch of wimps. Bragging is good for the 
ego after all :). What I am saying is that there should be more 
DISCUSSSION not abuse. If someone says they are the best, ask em 
why...then get them to prove it hehe.

I have posted this simply because I am sick and tired of the crap I 
see in this forum. Anyone who admits to cheating should not even be 
allowed to post in this forum...&#34;BLIZZARD TAKE NOTE OF THAT, IF 
YOU CAN'T GET THEM IN THE GAME, GET THEM OUTSIDE THEGAME&#34;.

Well I'm starting to ramble a bit, so I'll finish now. Please reply 
your feelings on this.......it is ment to be a discussion after all.
