<blockquote>
<pre>To all of my Snakegod brothers and sisters,

As you may have noticed, I have not been present in our hall for the 
past few days...

A dreadful fate has befallen me. Exactly three days ago, as I left 
Tristram, on my way to the hall of Snakegod, a foul spirit accosted 
me. He said that his name was Registry, and that he had come to me as 
a messenger of his lord, whose name I found more than a bit odd, not 
that it matters now. Windows95 was a strangely alien name for any 
being, but I listened, in my search for truth, as always. He asked me 
if I had backed up my registry. I was, of course, quite confused...

&#34;Back up?&#34; Said I. &#34;Registry?&#34; He said, &#34;Yes. 
From what I have learned, your Diablo registry is not backed up. 
Thus, your life, skills, and all you own are forfeit to Windows95, 
whom your actions displease.&#34;

This man angered me, as I do not take threats lightly. But, as I 
readied myself to confront this man, a sudden weakness came over me. 
I felt ill, and pitched over. When my head cleared, Registry was 
gone. 

I got to my feet, and brushed myself off. I realized that something 
was wrong when my fingers contacted cloth, not the plate I had been 
wearing. In a growing sense of horror, I realized that I was wearing 
nothing but my old red robes, from my early days as a mage. Checking 
myself, I also noticed that *all* my equipment was gone. Even the two 
rings I wore, one on each hand, and the Drake's Amulet of Wizardry 
that I cherished so much, had all vanished, into thin air...

As you might imagine, I stood there in shock. My memories were 
intact, all my experiences in Snakegod, my rivalry with Ransyn over 
the love of Madelyn, everything... Yet I stood there, weak, spell-
less, and in disbelief.

I hope you can understand why I felt that I could not return to our 
clan hall. The rest of that day, I wandered around Tristram, not 
understanding what had happened. No one recognized me, they saw only 
a n inexperienced mage, stumbling around the tavern Every step I had 
taken, had been in the light of Truth. I did not deserve to end up 
this way... I spent the rest of that cursed day drinking away my 
sorrows. All of you who visited the tavern three days ago probably 
didn't notice me, for I had all the appearances of a newly-minted 
mage...

I was lucky, for on the next day, I literally stumbled into 
Lohlander. At first, he did not recognize me, and asked if I needed 
any help.  It took a bit of convincing, but I told him who I was, and 
he believed me. In shame, I asked him to tell our Queen of my plight. 
I just could not bring myself to come to her with my shame...

Since then, I have achieved once more, the standing I describe as the 
9th Rank. I feel weak, still, but not as weak as I was, that 
treacherous day that I met the one known as Registry.

My search for the Truth goes on, as always. I may need some help, in 
the coming days, to deal with my loss, and carry on in my capacity in 
our great Clan. I am sorry for any self-pity I am displaying here, 
but I feel that it is understandable.

To Spellstormer: I suppose I will take you up on those mage-
assistance lessons you offered to me, months ago...

To Salmissra: I remain, as I always was, a loyal member of our Clan. 
However, please do not take offense if I am not around as much as 
usual, at least for a time. I need to find myself, and reaffirm my 
goals...

Sincerely yours,

Truthseeker
Sorceror of the 9th Rank
Wandering Mage(It seems, an Apprentice once more)
Snakegod Clan</pre>
