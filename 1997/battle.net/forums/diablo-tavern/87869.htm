<pre>&#62; I am a legit PKiller. I'm a leader of a antigod guild.

Cool, maybe your clan and mine can meet in combat someday...

&#62; 
&#62; And thats why I can't pkill anymore.
&#62; I don't hate cheating PKillers, but what about cheating co-opers? PK 
&#62; cheaters are not ruining the game but cheat co-opers are. And why? 
&#62; Let me tell:
&#62; 

Ok, have you ever wondered this? Why do co-opers cheat? Well, there 
are probably many more reasons that I can think of, but the ones that 
I can think of are: afraid of dying (its just a game guys), want to 
be powerfull (no comments cause I don't get this one), and or tired 
of constantly being pkilled or cheater killed (guess who is 
responsible for this one).  So you see we must not blame the victim 
(both sides probably), but must look at all the roots of the problem 
to find the solution.  If you think that cheater co-opers are at 
fault then the solution is limited only to them, but if you include 
yourself and others in the problem then the solutions grow and 
challenges the norm (thats Chaos logic btw).


&#62; You godmode co-opers are slowly killing the playing style called 
&#62; &#34;PKilling&#34;. And what is bnet without pkillers? Are there 
&#62; anything left then? What are we going to do then!!!!
&#62; 

Yeah, but you pk and cheat pkillers are &#34;making&#34; them do it.


&#62; Last night when I was PKilling in private games I didn't got any 
&#62; ears. And I'm sure that you know why. So I am asking other pkillers:
&#62; Are you getting ears anymore? Is there are chance that you are 
&#62; playing with a nongod co-oper? Is it possible?
&#62; 

Hmmm... Perhaps you suck (no offense intended just a legit question)?
I'M LEGIT AND HERE AND SO ARE MANY OTHERS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIND 
US!!! LOOK AT LEGIT CLANS AND GET THEIR NAMES FROM THERE. Geez does a 
pk and cheater hunter have to do all the work for you guys?

&#62; PK's may use cheats because they are not ruining the co-op playing 
&#62; style.
&#62; But cheating co-opers are!!!!
&#62; 

Read top part again if you don't remember it.


&#62; Do I, the PKiller, have to change the playing style? Is co-oping fun?
&#62; 

Try it, if not fun then change etc. etc.


&#62; And by the way, is WYND the GREAT alive anymore?
&#62; In real life?
&#62; Is he?
&#62; 

No clue, but his/her page rocked.

&#62; CO OPERS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Then do something about it. Geez, I advertise myself as a legit 
almost every day and nothing. I don't think I've been ever pkilled by 
anyone ever in my b-net life (except by accidents).
