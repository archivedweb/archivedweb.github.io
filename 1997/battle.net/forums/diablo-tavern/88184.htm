&#62; I don't think the question is, can you get to level 50? The question 
&#62; is, can you do it in so short a time as TheMan claims to have done? I 
&#62; don't remember exactly how long ago he turned 49 (does someone?), but 
&#62; it was about two weeks ago if I recall correctly. Now I've put in 
&#62; some serious playing time in the last two weeks, and only got about 
&#62; two-thirds of the way from 41 to 42 in that time. But then, only in 
&#62; the last few days have I been serious about trying to gain XP. 
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan says that at level 49 you get about 10 XP per kill. I don't 
&#62; know how much XP it takes to go from level 49 to 50, but let's say 
&#62; it's 200 million. Ok, to be conservative, let's say 100 million. This 
&#62; means that you'd need to kill 10 million baddies to do it. If TheMan 
&#62; killed one guy per second (a pretty liberal estimate for a warrior, 
&#62; factoring in stops to reload belt and trips to town), 24 hours a day, 
&#62; that'd take him 115 days (nearly four months) to do this. To do it in 
&#62; 8 hours a day, like he says he did, it would take 345 days, or about 
&#62; a year. To do it in two weeks, he'd have to have played 197 hours a 
&#62; day. 
&#62; 
&#62; Using his other estimate, that you get 10K per Hell/Hell clear, if he 
&#62; could clear Hell/hell in two hours (again, a liberal estimate for 
&#62; anyone... especially a warrior who insists on using a Grandfather, 
&#62; which can't stun witches and mages), that'd be 40K XP a day. Thus 
&#62; it'd take him 250 days (8 months) to accumulate 100 million XP (or 
&#62; just 85 days if he did it 24 hours a day). To do this in two weeks, 
&#62; he'd have to have played 143 hours a day. 
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan, I'm not trying to be mean to you. I'm not prosecuting you, 
&#62; I'm defending the bragging rights of true high level legits. If you 
&#62; can show me my arithmetic error here and prove that you are in fact a 
&#62; legit 50, then I will say that you are in fact a Diablo God (I will 
&#62; bow down to anyone who can get to 50!). However, it would seem 
&#62; mathematically to be nearly impossible that anyone could have done it 
&#62; in the amount of time that's passed since January 6, let alone since 
&#62; June 6. 
&#62; 
&#62; Please TheMan, point out my mistake. If you're legit, I must've made 
&#62; an obvious one (or maybe the data you gave me to work with had a 
&#62; margin of error of 246&#37;). If you're not legit, you'll simply 
&#62; reply with a &#60;no text&#62; at the end of your subject, or maybe 
&#62; stop and take the time to show me you care by mindlessly flaming me.
