&#62; OK, let me just cut to the chase. I think it has been established 
&#62; that at level 49, you get 10,000 exp per kill. If I'm not mistakem, 
&#62; it has also been pointed out that the experience needed to jump from 
&#62; 49 to 50 is 1.3 billion. In addition, most observers seem to believe 
&#62; that The Man jumped levels in a two week period, three weeks at most. 
&#62; I will use a THREE week period, just to give The Man the benefit of 
&#62; the doubt. The Man himself has stated that he played approximately 8 
&#62; hours per day over this period. So, how many kills must he make?  1.3 
&#62; billion divided by 10000, which is 130,000. He must do this over a 
&#62; three week period playing 8 hours a day. Twenty one days times 8 
&#62; hours equals 168 hours. One hundred thirty thousand kills divided by 
&#62; one hundred sixty eight hours equals approximately 770 kills per 
&#62; hour. In one hour there are 3600 seconds (60 min x 60 sec)...3600 
&#62; divided by 770 equals 4.67. That means that in order to gain the 
&#62; necessary experience to gain level 50 over a three week period, 
&#62; playing 8 hours a day, you must kill one monster every 4.67 seconds. 
&#62; The Man was using a warrior, and of course he was playing hell hell. 
&#62; I am not really experienced with a warrior, and neither am I close to 
&#62; level 50, so I will leave it up to the readers of this forum to 
&#62; comment on the probabilty of this being done....
&#62; 
&#62; Is the big duel still on for tonight at 10:00 central time? Heheh
&#62; Please reply, Ogden's readers!
&#62; 
&#62; Oh yeah, one other thing...some loser cheat claims to have cloned all 
&#62; of the Triad members, and also claims that he will hack account 
&#62; numbers so that our clones will have the same account numbers a s the 
&#62; real deal..is all of this possible? If so, please keep in mind that 
&#62; you may meet a clone of a Triad, and I'm quite sure he will probably 
&#62; cheat and be rude to boot...
&#62;

Whoops! I never thought I'd say this to that lyin' sack of goo TheMan 
(he falsely accused the Triad of cheating), but sorry! I did the 
above post hastily while eating lunch at work...the correct amount of 
experience required to get from level 49 to level 50 is apparently 
about 220 million I think. So lets redo the math. 220 million divided 
by the 10000 exp. you apparently get per kill in hell hell once being 
level 49 equals 22,000 kills necessary to gain level 50. Playing 
three weeks for eight hours a day, seven days a week is a total of 
168 hours of playing. 22000 divided by 168 equals approximately 131 
kills per hour necessary. 3600 seconds per hour divided by 131 kills 
per hour equals approximately one kill every 27 seconds. So if TheMan 
killed one monster every 27 seconds, eight hours a day, seven days a 
week, for three weeks, he could go from level 49 to level 50. Of 
course, keep in mind that much time will be spent going to town for 
potions, etc. and this is assuming that no &#34;breaks&#34; are taken 
etc...maybe now some of the hardened veteran warriors of bnet can 
comment on the likelihood of TheMan doing this...

For myself, all I can say is that TheMan has been caught in lies 
multiple times in this forum before..in fact, the first time I recall 
seeing him speaking in chat rooms was quite a while ago when he was 
jumping from channel to channel telling everyone who would listen 
that Inferno had disbanded..this was right around the time he got 
kicked out...at the time, of course, this was simply a lie. So 
whether or not TheMan has indeed been absent from chat channels long 
enough to have actually gained level 50 legitly (and if he has, then 
congratulations), it does not change the fact that he is a low class 
bald faced liar...'nuff said.
