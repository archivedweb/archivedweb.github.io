&#62; As researches had shown:
&#62; 
&#62; 99&#37; of people who play diablo and UO and hate PK are under 16 
&#62; years of age
&#62; 
&#62; 97&#37; of them are males....
&#62; 
&#62; 67&#37; of them are abused at schools and streets
&#62; 
&#62; 87&#37; of them have no girlfriend or boyfriend or any friend 
&#62; whatsoever, which drives them into search for Online friends.....
&#62; 
&#62; 78&#37; of them have no at all creativity or talent or 
&#62; personality.... which makes them all alike.
&#62; 
&#62; Now some Generalizations.. for dumbasses from our &#34;mature&#34; 
&#62; selfrighteous and nevertheless incredibly dumb clan SnakeDork... 
&#62; 
&#62; MAJORITY of Computer game players ARE teenagers.. some of them under 
&#62; age 16... so if you PK or NOT PK it doesn't matter percentage will be 
&#62; same...
&#62; 
&#62; People play games for different reasons.. some seek relaxation and 
&#62; excersize for brains tired from alike work, some seek 
&#62; interntainment... (PK) some have NO friends and therefore are alone.. 
&#62; so they seek Friends in Online World.. how to find friends there?? 
&#62; Simple, be NICE to each other...
&#62; 
&#62; It is NO secret that Coopers are less skillfull in game then most of 
&#62; PKillers... reason for this is that while majority of PK log on to 
&#62; PLAY game... coopers log in to chat... because they have no one to 
&#62; call in RL, they have no friends to visit.. and online clans of jerks 
&#62; such as SnakeDorks are their &#34;Only Family&#34; .. rem,eber 
&#62; kairaega???
&#62; 
&#62; I am opposed to mindless and more important idiotic slander of 
&#62; PKillers, I met some of the MOST mature and intelligent people in 
&#62; PoC, medium age of PKillers from OUR clan is over 20 and people in 
&#62; PoC play game instead of interacting with one another in search of 
&#62; something they don't have in RL.. (never mind my cybersex adventures) 
&#62; he he eh...
&#62; 
&#62; Ohh well.. I guess Coopers wn'tcare.. with such mature people from 
&#62; SnakeDorks like Varmaven or Shaft... they sure shoulf feel proud 
&#62; about themselves... YAWN... trust me... LEAST mature people I met in 
&#62; Online world are cheaters and dumb coopers.... who think that people 
&#62; have NO moral right to PKill them in Online game...
&#62; 
&#62; WAKE up.. it's only a game....


I just don't understand why people buy a game like UO which has the 
ability to PK and then cry and complain when it happens.  Yes, the 
notoriety system in UO is flawed and needs to be fixed.  Instead of 
whinning and complaining about PK's, role-play some.  Be the good guy 
and take them out.  For goodness sake people, UO has the pontential 
to be alot of fun battling good against evil.  Let's have some fun!!! 
 If you hate PK's and especially POC so much, get skilled and kill 
them.  Hound them whenever you see them. That is the way the game is 
designed.  I for one am going to get my skills up and then fight back 
whenever I have to.  If I get PK'd so what.  I can always earn more 
money.  Let's end this sorry debate and let's have some fun playing 
the game.
