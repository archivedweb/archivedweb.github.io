<pre>On Fri May 30 15:57, Rikor (Snakegod) wrote:
&#62; 
&#62; Tales of the White Wolf  Chapter Seven
&#62; 
&#62; 	The sun began its rise into the morning sky. Rikor watched as Mandi 
&#62; surveyed the road in both directions. They had already been on the 
&#62; move of over an hour, carefully working their way through the woods 
&#62; toward the main road. Moments ago they came upon the edge of the 
&#62; road. Mandi had signaled for everyone to halt. She motioned them down 
&#62; into a squat and the rogue slid quietly forward to the very fringe of 
&#62; the woods.
&#62; 	&#34;No one moving on the road now. It's still a little early for 
&#62; much travel. We must move quickly.&#34; she said in a low yet 
&#62; resolute voice..
&#62; 	The fear that this delay would cause them to lose the trail of his 
&#62; sister and her captors nagged at Rikor as the band of travelers  
&#62; moved out of the forest and quickly down the well traveled road. The 
&#62; elf, Justin, had caused all of this. If he could just get his hands 
&#62; on that slender Elven throat he'd... He'd what! Rikor knew that 
&#62; Justin had meant him no harm. The elf was merely defending himself 
&#62; against the bullying of the Iron Deaths. The young warrior actually 
&#62; admired the elf for standing up to the Death. If only he hadn't 
&#62; chosen to do it in Rikor's presence.
&#62; 	For nearly an hour they traveled. No one spoke. No one's eyes 
&#62; diverted from the road. Finally they encountered a small wagon, 
&#62; apparently a traveling theater group coming toward them from Tristram.
&#62; 	&#34;Elario, you speak with them. Find out if they have seen 
&#62; Suzanna&#34; Rikor said to his brother.
&#62; 	The younger brother hailed down the wagon and began to talk with the 
&#62; man holding the reins. The remainder of the party, Mandi, the wolf  
&#62; and Rikor took a rest under a large spreading oak at the side of the 
&#62; road. Rikor could not make out the details of the conversation, but 
&#62; both Elario and the traveler smiled and laughed on more than one 
&#62; occasion.
&#62; 	After a few minutes the wagon began to move, the man waved at all of 
&#62; them and bade them farewell. Elario joined his companions on the soft 
&#62; grass in the shade of the tree.
&#62; 	&#34;It seems that our friends there met up with a band of four men 
&#62; escorting a bound and gagged young woman just before last nightfall. 
&#62; They camped a hundred yards apart and the group escorting the woman 
&#62; had not broken camp when Rozo, the roving actor, and his group began 
&#62; their day. By his estimation we are a few hours to their rear. Rozo 
&#62; also mentioned that there are Iron Deaths patrolling the roads and 
&#62; surrounding countryside. Seems an elf, a warrior and a rogue killed 
&#62; one of them in Moonridge and they are not very happy about it.&#34; 
&#62; Elario related his conversion to the others.
&#62; 	Rikor thought about the situation for a moment and then said, 
&#62; &#34;If we travel an extra hour or two before nightfall, we should be 
&#62; able to catch them by tomorrow.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;If we push hard we could catch them during the night&#34; 
&#62; stated Mandi, &#34;You could have your sister back tonight.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Finding them and getting Suzanna back are two different 
&#62; concerns. We must have the opportunity to access the situation before 
&#62; attempting the rescue. We know nothing of the strengths or weaknesses 
&#62; of our opponents.&#34; Rikor was very firm and definite with his 
&#62; words. He could see the reaction in the rogue's eyes before she even 
&#62; responded.
&#62; 	&#34;The longer we delay the higher the risk of something happening 
&#62; to your sister!! We must move quickly.&#34; There was fire in those 
&#62; words. The rogue obviously did not believe in subtlety.
&#62; 	Rikor knew they must take care when they located their prey and he 
&#62; must somehow convince Mandi of that. The young rogue reminded him in 
&#62; many ways of his sister, fiery and headstrong. Both willing to rush 
&#62; headlong into hell for a cause in which they believed. Mandi, he 
&#62; thought, and Suzanna would most likely get along really well. His 
&#62; sister could use a female friend. She had spent nearly all of her 
&#62; time since their mother's death caring for her two older brothers.
&#62; 	Hoping to compromise, Rikor said, &#34;Well we need to get on the 
&#62; road. We'll determine the best plan of attack once we catch them. 
&#62; Agreed Mandi?&#34;
&#62; 	A reluctant nod of the head was the only response he got from the 
&#62; rogue.
&#62; 	&#34;Don't be so hard on her Rikor.&#34; Elario whispered in his ear 
&#62; as Mandi started off down the road.	
&#62; 	Rikor called for the wolf, who had wandered into the woods a few 
&#62; minutes prior.  The large white creature bounded from the brush and 
&#62; joined the two brothers in catching up with the fast moving rogue.
&#62; 	&#34;Convincing this rogue of anything that she hasn't already 
&#62; agreed to is going to be difficult.&#34; Rikor thought. As they 
&#62; briskly traveled, following the road they knew would take them to 
&#62; Suzanna and eventually Tristram, Rikor considered many different ways 
&#62; of handling the situation with Mandi. None seemed to be right. He 
&#62; couldn't just force her to submit to his plan, but maybe she would 
&#62; compromise. Not likely, but.....
&#62; 	The four rounded a bend in the road at his point and found 
&#62; themselves facing two men. The two were caring on a fairly heated 
&#62; discussion. One of the men, a weathered barbarian, tall and rangy of 
&#62; appearance, was using his hands to apparently make a point with the 
&#62; other.
&#62; 	The other man was easily recognizable. He wore the black plate of 
&#62; the Iron Deaths. A gigantic two-handed sword hung at his side. His 
&#62; helmed head bobbed agreement and disagreement as he listened to the 
&#62; barbarian. 
&#62; 	&#34;I'll not follow you to Moonridge to answer questions. You ask 
&#62; me what you will right here, I'll answer and then I'll be on my 
&#62; way!!&#34; growled the barbarian, his obvious disdain beginning to 
&#62; get the better of him.
&#62; 	&#34;As a member of the Iron Deaths, I hereby order that you should 
&#62; accompany me to Moonridge to be questioned by my captain.&#34; 
&#62; shouted the Iron Death. You sense that his anger was about to take 
&#62; control of his actions.
&#62; 	Rikor and his companions tried to go unnoticed, but the Iron Death 
&#62; caught sight of them and diverted his attention from the barbarian to 
&#62; the four of them.
&#62; 	&#34;Halt. Come here and identify yourselves.&#34; roared the 
&#62; Death,&#34;Now!!!&#34;
&#62; 	Hesitantly they did as requested, each preparing for what could 
&#62; occur next. The Death looked them over and over, including the great 
&#62; white wolf.
&#62; 	&#34;What is that creature doing traveling with three humans?&#34; 
&#62; the Iron Death ask of none of them in particular.
&#62; 	&#34;He's my pet.&#34; stated Rikor flatly.
&#62; 	The Death now looked at Mandi and Rikor very closely. From one to 
&#62; the other his eyes moved.
&#62; 	&#34;You two look like two of the three who killed of one of us in 
&#62; Moonridge. What say you?&#34; he asked of Rikor or Mandi as he slowly 
&#62; drew his sword from its home.
&#62; 	&#34;Well....&#34; Rikor struggled to concocted a story that would 
&#62; be believable. He glanced quickly at Mandi, who for the first time 
&#62; since he had met her seemed without words. The young warrior knew 
&#62; that his answer could make the difference between all of them living 
&#62; or dying. His mind just seemed to go blank.
&#62; 	&#34;I'll answer that for the boy.&#34; The comment came from the 
&#62; barbarian, whom the Death had completely forgotten. The tall figure 
&#62; was now standing directly behind the Death with his large polished 
&#62; blade drawn from its scabbard. The Death turned, but reacted too 
&#62; slowly. Before he had the time to get  his sword in a ready position, 
&#62; the barbarian had remove his right arm with one well placed swing of 
&#62; his weapon. Just as quickly the old warrior drove the end of his 
&#62; blade through the heart of the evil one. The Iron Death screamed 
&#62; once, lurched backwards and fell to the ground at Rikor's feet.
&#62; 	&#34;Not bad for an old timer, huh kid!&#34; the barbarian said 
&#62; matter-of-factly. Rikor stood slightly stunned at what had taken only 
&#62; a few seconds. Mandi and Elario also were just as surprised, theirs 
&#62; mouths agape with astonishment.
&#62; 	&#34;I'll be on my way. You youngsters drag that body off of the 
&#62; road will you? Those Deaths are always trying to bother me. I wish 
&#62; they would learn their lesson.&#34; the seasoned warrior said.
&#62; With a slight wave of his hand, he turned and started off down the 
&#62; road.
&#62; 	The three youngsters watched as the barbarian, distinguishable only 
&#62; by his bright red tunic and the small tatoo of a serpent on his 
&#62; forearm, sauntered down the road in the direction from which they had 
&#62; come. They stood transfixed on the body of the Iron Death that lay 
&#62; before them.
&#62; 	Finally Rikor spoke, &#34;Let's do as he said and move this 
&#62; body.&#34; the young warrior said as he and Elario grabbed the Death 
&#62; by his legs and pulled the body into a small ravine at the side of 
&#62; the road.
&#62; 	Still in shock, the band resumed their travel in silence once again. 
&#62; They continued to follow the road, only occasionally seeing anyone 
&#62; else. Whenever they did encounter others, they just remained casual 
&#62; and continued with hesitation. They stopped once for water and to 
&#62; consume as little food, but only a few words were exchanged during 
&#62; the short rest. They all seemed to be possessed of a sense of 
&#62; purpose. The drive to overtake Suzanna and her abductors. This seemed 
&#62; to force them onward, pushing each other, silently forward.
&#62; 	The sun had left the sky two hours before the spied a campfire one 
&#62; hundred yards from the side of the road. The wolf had sensed the 
&#62; presence of other humans first and had let out a soft growl to 
&#62; forewarn Rikor. 
&#62; 	Rikor quietly caught the attentions of his companions and the group 
&#62; moved into a place of cover to discuss how to approach the situation. 
&#62; Rikor and Mandi of course disagreed and Elario tried to act as 
&#62; arbitrator. Finally it was decided that Elario would crawl forward 
&#62; and scout out the situation. Mandi and Rikor would flank him, back 
&#62; slightly.
&#62; 	They put the plan into action and three were slowly moving forward. 
&#62; The wold had remained back, quietly waiting a word from Rikor to 
&#62; assist if needed.
&#62; 	Elario slid slowly through the brush to the edge of the clearing 
&#62; where the fire burnt. At first he could just barely make out shapes 
&#62; within the camp. Then the occupants of the encampment came into focus.
&#62; 	Elario stood straight up and shouted, &#34;Finston!! It's me, 
&#62; Elario.&#34;
&#62;
