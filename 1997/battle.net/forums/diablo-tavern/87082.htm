&#62; I'm proudly to announce that legit PKILLING is DEAD.
&#62; Now, you can't join any public game to kill people.  How nice! :)

Dead?  Nope.  Believe it or not there are still some skilled players 
out there who DON'T USE GOD MODE!  Wow, what a concept, eh?  Even 
fewed don't use dupes or hacks, but I don't kill them anyway.

&#62; Only way to pkilling is now DUEL.  Yup, your backstabbing days of 
&#62; pkilling has ended.  If you didn't notice, more than half of B.net 
&#62; citizens CHEAT.

No, people cheat during duels too.  Trust me.

&#62; Now, only way to pkill other is to use CHEAT.  
&#62; I don't belief that you can now actually kill more than 20 per day.  
&#62; With this kind of situation, you MUST cheat to kill.  Now, that make 
&#62; you a cheater.  

Uhh...I don't cheat, and I kill cheaters.  Sure, I die alot, but I 
don't care.  Its not like they earned my ear or anything.  You don't 
HAVE to cheat to kill, not by a long shot...its just that alot of 
people CHOSE to.
 
&#62; And also even if you are pkilled by cheaters, it is the same thing as 
&#62; you have been pkilled by legits.  No difference, result is that you 
&#62; die.  So don't blame cheaters, blame PKILLERS, Pkillers even include 
&#62; CHEATER-PKs.  So, if you've been pkilled, no pain, no gain.

Same result, yes, but the method of getting there is MUCH different, 
as are the morals behind it.  If you kill me using autokill, God 
Mode, etc., you didn't earn my ear, you simply took it.  Therefore, 
it means nothing.  Very few people out there have beat me in a fair 
duel (hats off to you)
 
&#62; 
&#62; Balance of POWERs in B.net
&#62; 
&#62; Legit= less than 20&#37;
&#62; Cheaters= More than 80&#37;
&#62; 

Real players=20&#37;
People who can't play so they cheat to win at an easy game=80&#37;

&#62; CHEATERS ARE EVEN SUPERIOR IN NUMBERS!!! :(
&#62; WE CAN'T GO FIGHT THEM, HOW CAN WE FIGHT WHOM WE CAN'T HIT??
&#62; FORGET ABOUT LEGITIZING THE CHEATERS!
&#62; WE CAN'T WIN!!!  

We may not be able to win, but DAMNIT we can try.  Better to go down 
with a fight than with a wimper.

&#62; S-R
&#62; 
&#62; p.s.  LEGIT pkilling days has ended, accept your destiny, it was 
&#62; forseen.  

Forseen?  Uhh...no.  Legit PKing isn't over until either the last 
legit PK leaves Diablo, or the last player without god mode leaves 
Diablo.  

&#34;We have not yet begun to fight.&#34;
