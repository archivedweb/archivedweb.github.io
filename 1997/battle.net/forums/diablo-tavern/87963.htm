<blockquote>
<pre>	Sairkon stood over a small symbol. It hung on a thin wooden post, 
and bore a strange marking on it. Sairkon's blood chilled cold as he 
tried desperately to decipher the inscription. It was carved into the 
wood, and hard to make out. Perhaps it was written in a different 
tongue, he thought.
	&#34;Ri-si...&#34; He squinted hard at the markings, and put a 
finger up to the wood. He pulled a scroll out of his pouch, and 
stared at it for a few seconds. It hadn't helped. Maybe if he looked 
at the letters a different way. . . He had it! &#34;Tavern of the 
Rising Sun! Good thing too, I need an ale.&#34;
	
	Pulling up a stool, he sat at the counter, next to a burly looking 
man and a woman with a bow slung over her shoulders. The man stared 
at Sairkon, scowled, and put his arm around the woman. The woman 
smiled up at the man, and neatly sliced his forearm with a dagger. 
Sairkon was puzzled. Well, he thought, my papa told me strange things 
went on in the big cities like. . . he turned to the burly man, who 
was desperately trying to staunch the bleeding. Oblivious, Sairkon 
smiled brightly. &#34;Sir, what's the name of this city?&#34;
	The warrior boggled at the young mage, and tried to answer and 
prevent from screaming at the same time. While his brain was tied up 
with his mouth, his legs went free from straddling the stool. 
&#34;Yeeoww!&#34; the warrior yelled, as he fell off of his stool and 
crashed wounded arm-first into the floor. &#34;Owowowowow!&#34; he 
cried, after he realized what part of him had hit the floor. 
&#34;Aaaaggghhhh&#34; he added, upon further reflection.
	Sairkon turned away. What an odd name for a town, he thought. He 
turned once again to the warrior, seemingly unaware of his position. 
&#34;So, sir, what are you called?&#34;
	The warrior, still on the floor and bleeding, looked at the mage 
once more. He had once more regained control of himself, and 
answered. &#34;Mename be Ribs, and I be pleased to make yer 
accquaintance. Now, as for my position. . .&#34;
	Sairkon looked down at the warrior, and finally noticed something. 
&#34;Why is your arm bleeding?&#34;
	Ribs boggled. He was too preoccupied with dealing with the slow mage 
to say anything, so Sairkon filled in the gaps.
	&#34;That's okay, my papa says that strange things happen in the big 
city. So Ribs, why don't you talk to that nice looking lady? She 
keeps smiling at you.&#34;
	Indeed, the young rogue could barely stop herself from laughing as 
she looked at the warrior sprawled on the floor. Ribs took note of 
his position and got back up on his bar stool. He turned to the young 
mage once more, recovering from his astonishment. &#34;So, what be ye 
called, simpleton?&#34;
	&#34;Well, I not be called simpleton, but many have chosen to call 
me that.&#34; He smiled brightly. &#34;I accept it as a symbol of 
friendship. You may call me that if you wish, and you can be my 
friend too.&#34; He thought a bit. &#34;You may also call me 
Sairkon.&#34;
	Ribs, stunned again, diverted too much attention from his legs to 
think about what the mage was saying, and he crashed to the ground 
once more. 
	&#34;My papa told me to come out to Tristram to seek my fortune, 
friend Ribs, do you know where I can find that?&#34; He looked at the 
warrior closely. &#34;Oh dear, why are you sitting on the ground?&#34;
	Ribs chose not to answer. &#34;Sairkon, give me your hand.&#34; 
	Sairkon gave his hand to the warrior, and was pulled out of his 
stool onto the floor, as the warrior tried to get up by pulling on 
Sairkon's hand. &#34;Oh dear. Ribs, why did you pull me down? My papa 
told me that people should be nice to others, and that good fortunes 
will follow the kind and the wise.&#34; Sairkon thought some. &#34;I 
am not yet wise, so I try to be the kindest that I can be.&#34;
	Ribs chose not to insult the cheerful little mage. &#34;Sairkon, I 
was trying to get you to help pull me up. That would have been a kind 
thing to do,&#34; he said, humoring the mage, who now frowned.
	&#34;Oh dear. I am terribly sorry Ribs, I had no idea. What can I do 
to make it up to you?&#34;
	Ribs got up and sat on his stool once more. He looked down at the 
mage, smiled and spoke. &#34;Sairkon, all I want you to do is to buy 
me an ale, if you at all can.&#34;
	Sairkon put on his biggest smile. &#34;Certainly, I would be happy, 
no, honored to buy you an ale, Ribs.&#34; He summoned the barmaid. 
&#34;Miss?&#34; he smiled brightly &#34;if it isnt too much trouble, 
I would like you to bring me two of your nicest, bestest ales that 
you have.&#34; The woman wasn't sure how to react to the smiling 
fool, but nonetheless, she brought two ales out to the grinning mage 
and his new friend.
