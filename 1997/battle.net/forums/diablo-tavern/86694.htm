<pre>Ok agree pretty much.  However I do think I found either a godly rags 
or cloak in hell/hell once.  Things I have bought from wirt: 
Merciless bow of thunder(or burning, can't remember cause this was 
before my uninstall/reinstall where I lost all my stuff, so it gone 
now) with max damage bonus in a long war bow.  Was 117K at wirt.  Ok, 
I HAVE found 1 Emerald item.  I remember cause I basically sh*t my 
pants cause I thought I could only get from wirt.  Eugene, I think 
either you or fist was around, cause someone joined the game I found 
it and whoever it was we were pretty surprised.  I have never found 
in the dungeons: strange or holy items.  I have bought a bunch of 
strange stuff from wirt.  BTW Fist and I DID see wirt selling a 
Masters Bow before I BELIEVE, A LONG TIME AGO.  Ask Fist, he will 
remember, however that could have been changed in a patch.  Now, BLZ 
had reported finding all kinds of cool stuff in version 1.0 or 
whatever it was.  However, in old days I hardly ever searched for 
stuff, I was too busy pking.  NOW I can safely say in all my trips I 
have never found Holy armor at ALL.  Which really makes me doubt a 
little certain someone's holy plate armor they say they found.  I 
would not be surprised if someone found one of those duped copies of 
one and made him drop his armor that oh so familiar MK message would 
appear.  Now, seeing how I have found Emerald item, MAYBE those can 
be found cause Adria sells them.  However, I have only found the one, 
and it may have just been a staff(which could even further prove 
adria connection), or it was a shield.  I bought 2 emerald shields 
from wirt, so maybe I still have other emerald item in storage 
someplace and can know for sure what it was.  Anyway, me and Fist 
were really excited when we saw masters bow, cause we thought for 
sure a kings bow would also exist.  However, we changed our minds 
lately, thinking that some prefixes only work for SOME items.  What I 
mean is, Kings maybe restricted to swords and axes only.  This could 
be proven by the fact that there are some prefixes in the same family 
that do not advance past a certain point for rings and amulets.  
Example is iron, silver, gold, platinum, weird, all the way to 
strange.  The rings stop at Gold.  Also, as for that little rogue I 
was making, if I wanted to, I could have gotten her DEX up to max if 
I put all energy into it.  I figure in one game of Hell run, I could 
get like average of 10 Dex elixers.  So that makes 10 runs and 
constand transfering to said little rogue.  However, I have not put 
that energy into it.  I usually only did it if time was right or I 
thought about it.  As for other things, I know a lot of people who 
have played this game a lot and never found Holy or Godly or GPOW 
etc.  I think odds of one lucky sob finding it are EXTREMELY RARE, if 
even possible at all.  SHeesh, Fist can attest to my frenzy of 
searching for king's bow..I went on hundreds of hell runs.  Also, I 
think I saw a blizzard post a long time ago in eith tech support or 
suggestions area that there was no king's bow.  Blah, later.
