<pre>All,
   Well I have found myself PKILLING less and less and playing Co-Op 
more and more. I think I am finally getting bored with 
PKILLING...I've done it every legit way possible....MKILL, PKILL, No 
spells weapon only....no equipment....and so on. Well I was playing 
Co-op today with a guy called LORD_CHAOS I believe and had my level 
24 mage with crap for spells...in a game called legits only. Well 
LORD_CHOAS died a few times while we were playing...the last time he 
died I didnt have any res's left....so a player ELEVOR or something 
to that effect say he has one and is on his way. So I portal him down 
to the catacombs to res CHOAS. ELEVOR was a level 22 warrior(I was a 
level 24 mage)...he comes through the portal...blazing arrows(yes a 
PKILLING warrior with a bow!!!) and fireballs....I was equpped with 
MINDCRY so I needed to switch weapons....I run around a corner and 
ELEVOR follows(Good).. he manages to hit me once with an arrow...took 
about 250 of my manna shield....I switch to Fireball staff (Fireball 
spell level is 3!!!!) I position myself around a level down and face 
the direction i was running from....ELEVOR shouts &#34;you chicken 
s&^t&#34; and as soon as he turns the corner WHOOSH...about 10 
fireballs make him dead as a doornail.....he quits the games as soon 
as he is dead. 

    I think the most fun of my Co-op games today was turning the 
table on the PKILLER (although not a very bright one....low level 
WARRIOR pkilling with a bow...PLEASE). The moral of this story 
PKILLERS add to the game plain and simple. If I would have died it 
still would have been fun. 

Later
SAM HAIN

P.S. I get ears even in Co-op games.....MUHAHAHAHA </pre>
