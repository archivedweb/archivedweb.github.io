<blockquote>
<pre>[This story runs parallel in time to Lepthana's...
I will not rewrite any of what Lepthana has said, merely add my 
portion to it.  This is a bit odd, but since we are both Snakegod, it 
should be expected that there would be some overlap in our versions.]

The merriment was in full swing by the time Anti_Snoop showed up.  
This was usually the case since she still considered herself more of 
a loner than the rest of the Snakegod Clan.  Certainly, she was made 
to feel more than welcome and equally as much a part of the family as 
the rest.  She was, after all, the leader of the SnoopStudy, the most 
prominent learning institute on the arts of cooperative adventuring. 
However,  her long and often lonely past was not yet a distant 
memory.  

At times Anti_Snoop didn't mind just being alone.  Journeying through 
the depths of the Catacombs and Caves in solidute helped to clear her 
mind.  It gave some peace to her inner self and the knowledge that 
she alone possesed.  Many a Snakegod brother or sister had happened 
upon her in this state.

Cohen, as usual, was at the door.  With his wide grin and now 
familiar sweeping look over Anti_Snoop's pointy arrows, he was about 
to release some jovial comment when he caught Anti_Snoop's eyes and 
the look about her.  His expression quickly faded as he stepped aside 
to allow her into the Snakegod Hall.  He had worked with Anti_Snoop 
long enough at the Study to know when she should be left to herself.

Anti_Snoop took only a moment to scan the Hall and take in her 
surroundings.  She quickly spotted Lepthana and Atropos alone 
together and knew that the inevitable was beginning.  She walked 
briskly over and sat down beside Lepthana without so much as a word.  
Atropos' shock was apparant to all, until Lepthana said quietly, 
&#34;It's ok, Anti_Snoop and I have spent much time in the Library of 
Ordo Rosae Moriatur - it was a while ago, but she also knows what you 
have only recently discovered.&#34;

&#34;I only stopped by to let you know, Lepthana, that I have given 
Frylia my word that I will help as best I can.&#34;, Anti_Snoop said. 
 &#34;I informed Frylia that I too have noticed the signs...&#34; she 
trailed off unable to continue.  

Lepthana was a bit concerned at Anti_Snoop's sudden seriousness.  
Along with Ridcully, Anti_Snoop had become one of the more humorous 
clan members, so this change was almost too much.  She was about to 
ask Anti_Snoop about it, but as she turned, the question forming on 
her lips, she was only able to catch a glimpse of Anti_Snoop leaving 
the Hall...
