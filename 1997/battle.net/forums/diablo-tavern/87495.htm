<blockquote>
<pre>Cuda and others,

When Tarot was first created, a few positions within the guild were 
set aside for bounty hunters.  These are the Ace of each house (Cups, 
Coins, Wands, and Swords) and Death.  Death is the lead bounty hunter 
of the guild.  The bounty hunters' purpose is to kill enemies of the 
guild, and as far as I know they are the only people within the guild 
that are allowed to PK.  

Actually, when one reviews the list of positions and their roles in 
Tarot, a surprisingly large number of them deal with the 
identification and judgment of PKs (in addition to the bounty hunters 
themselves).  This is perhaps a bit archaic for a guild that mainly 
hangs out in private games nowadays, but perhaps these roles may 
prove useful again in UO and elsewhere.

Some members have suggested removing the bounty hunter positions 
altogether, and thus have Tarot become strictly non-PK.  This 
proposal has not been acted upon yet.  

At last Saturday's meeting, a quorom of Tarot members unaminously 
voted to offer Cuda the position of Death.  Zaphod was supposed to 
relay this information to Cuda, to determine whether Cuda accepted 
the offer or not.  I do not know if he has done this yet.

As far as I am concerned, Cuda, you are Death if you want it.  
However, in light of the recent proposal to eliminate bounty hunters 
from the guild entirely, it perhaps may be best to hold off on this 
until we can put it to a formal vote.  I will contact Braveheart 
immediately regarding this matter.  Stay tuned ... :)
