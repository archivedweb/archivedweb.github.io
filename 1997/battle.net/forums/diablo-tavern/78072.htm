<pre>&#62; &#34;Well Cuda, seems our showdown is comming forever closer... hehe. 
&#62; I still hope to get a few levels before the fight... by the way, what 
&#62; level are you? THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!&#34;

In answer to the question; 44th going on 45th level Rogue.

In answer to the idea I say this;
No way, and I don't expect or want you to quit playing with Mystic 
Force if I happen to win. What if there is a nasty lag at the moment 
you are trying to fireball me and it doesn't affect me as badly as it 
affects you? Do you still give up your character? No Way! I know I'm 
going to play Cuda until she is 48th or 50th or whatever the upper 
limit is, then, and only then, will I retire her.

So, if you want to agree to this with someone else thats your deal, 
and while I respect it I also think you should put a little more 
thought into how many different ways and reasons there are to die. 
Also, lets face it, how are you going to know for sure if the one 
that killed you is totaly legit anyway? And depending on lag and 
mistakes in judgment and distractions outside the game, etc... I 
could kill you with a totaly legit 15th level warrior if your on the 
bad end of everything I just mentioned...

So, do what ever you think is going to give you the most enjoyment 
out of the game. But during our fight, do me a favor? Tell me that if 
I win your going to retire Mystic, if thats the case then we'll go 2 
out of 3. 

Otherwise I only kill someone once, no excuses, ever. 

Looking forward to it no matter what you decide...  O;)






       Cuda       O;)</pre>
