<pre>this goes out to all those players who don't cheat on bnet, i want to 
hear your Top 10 most memorable moments while on bnet, whether that 
be playing the actual game, or just chatting about something in your 
favorite channel, that doesn't matter, let's have it....i haven't 
been on bnet a long time (probably around 4 months), so here's my Top 
10 most memorable moments:

1.  Getting my first dot with my first character (who got erased by 
Win95, God bless his soul :P)
2.  Getting my first dot with my second character (happened around a 
month and a half ago, when my first character got trashed)
3.  Actually going to Gris and finding a KSOH! yes, i did buy it, but 
i had to sell alot of stuff
4.  My first BH kill on bnet ...... he was around level 15 i think, i 
was level 13, i still whipped that dude/dudette's (_|_)
5.  Making my guild the ND, a guild of BHs, still going kinda strong, 
although we have only around 10 members
6.  Taking my guild and banding with the Arch-Angels Force, a good 
move if i don't say so myself, they've been fun to hang with
7.  Oh, that Gargous chapter in my life, a lvl 50 mage cheater trying 
to PK a lvl 25 warrior, and the funny part was i still whipped his 
sorry (_|_), twice to be sure.......he has probably the worst aim 
with his fireball, cuz he hit my only 2 times, thank god i had my 
full rejuv potions :)
8.  Some guy named Justice accusing my new character of being hacked, 
cuz i had a knights sword of haste.....&#34;that's duped! i'll kill 
you you stupid duper!&#34;.....oh sure.......Knights Sword of haste 
duped....hhhmmm....next thing you'll know, Mail of Giants will be the 
next hottest duped item on bnet :P
9.  AAF's duelfest, i entered, but no one challenged me.......i won 
my class by default........why? i wanted to duel someone :(
10. Getting res/fireballed about 30 times by some lozzah cheater 
&#60;AAF members know who this is, as i've told almost everyone&#62;</pre>
