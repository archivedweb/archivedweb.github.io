oh well, i guess you just have no idea what you're talking about.
diablo was a great game the first month after it came out, but it's
little more than crap now.
anyway, why do you think that diablo is better than UO ever could be ?
did you play it ? in this case you must have played a *very* 
private and secret beta...
please remember one thing before you post similar &#34;ideas&#34; :
1) UO will be a real rpg, not such a laughable imitation like diablo.
2) diablo is little more than hack'n'slay with trading option.. 
interaction
and monster AI are poor (which won't be the case in UO).
3) four players in a game is a joke.. you can't form groups, allies 
etc.
(and don't tell me two persons could form a group.. what about 30 
persons?!?).
4) after you killed diablo x times it gets boring very fast because 
you cannot
discover anything new - UO will have a world which changes all the 
time.
5) 3 different characters/classes without restrictments to 
equipment/spells etc.
and you actually dare to it with UO ? muahahaha...

about the costs of UO:
you are right,they will charge a monthly fee, but i think this is a 
good idea.
why ? because it gives origion the motivation they need to improve UO 
even
more when it's running, and to prevent people from cheating and 
similar stuff.
in fact, if it was similar on battle-net i'd bet that there were much 
less cheaters
or they'd be kicked off as soon as they joined (if they had illegal 
equipment or
stats).

&#62;What else is there to do? Attempt to stop AK, MK, or 
&#62; TK again? They are obviously excellent programers at Blizzard, but 
&#62; there are people out there who can find 
&#62; their way around a computer as well or better then any Blizzard 
&#62; staff.

you see for yourself now that there's no solution because of the 
design of diablo
and the lacking effort of blizzard.
they tried to prevent cheating when programming the game, but what 
happened
is they ATTRACTED people to try messing around with diablo. as i see 
it this was
an open invitation to hack diablo wherever it was possible.

&#62; Anyway, just the principle that Diablo is being updated would 
&#62; be nice, but...what's the point? Tell me what it might do?

there's no point. if something looks dead don't try to get it back to 
life.
