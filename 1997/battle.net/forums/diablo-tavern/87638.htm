<pre>	Well I could care less about formatting at the moment.. I think I 
will just jump to what this whole post is about.. what the hell is it 
with &#34;legits&#34; who think that anti-cheats are not cheats?  If 
you create a third party program to &#34;stop&#34; cheats you are 
CHEATING.. yes CHEATING.. if you use Diablo's Eye.. you are CHEATING 
now don't give me that crap about it will protect you and show you 
who cheats.. I don't care!  If you use a backup for in case you die.. 
its.. yes... CHEATING.. you are a CHEATER! I don't think you quite 
grasp that..  guess what.. duping.. it is not only a bug but.. if you 
take advantage of the bug by duping you are.. yes.. CHEATING.  Now if 
you were truly legit.. you wouldn't dupe, backup, use deye, use any 
form of anti-cheat at all.  I don't know many of those.. do you?  I 
can say that half of the &#34;legit&#34; guilds don't check their 
people enough.. most people use deye, backup and the like.. I know 
about 20 people on ALL of battle.net who don't cheat in any way.. how 
many do you know?  I know I am rambling but I don't care!  I am tired 
of people saying cheats are dying cause more people are getting anti-
cheats and such.. what idiots.. I love it when someone says &#34;I 
don't cheat I just dupe&#34; I kick their asses with my little rogue 
who is legit and has 400 to hit with the strange heavens and gold 
jewels and then tell em not to dupe :)  Do you like logging onto 
battle.net with your character to see cheaters spamming, stupid asses 
just being stupid, people hacking others, people hacking themselves, 
and what not?  I think that if you truly want to get away from people 
that you should just make your own little guild or whatever and go to 
a PRIVATE channel and play PRIVATE games that way you have no reason 
to have to complain about your char getting hacked or whatever.  I 
for one could care less but my roommate hates that crap.  He has 
formed a little guild of his friends who he plays with and chats with 
and he hardly comes out of that channel.. in fact he is probably 
sitting there now!  I can come on at 2am and go to that channel and 
he will be chatting with friends.. its like aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh.. 
but.. he is safe from all attacks from lamers and he has safe games 
where he doesn't have to worry about anything really (except the 
occasional death by monster or misfired spell or arrow:) )  Wouldn't 
you like to be able to control your environment?  Then join a guild 
with your interests and stay there all day.. it is fun for some but I 
personally like to get out and not just site in a damn channel all 
day.

	Now for some.. cheating is a way of life.. I for one make hacks but 
I only use them to test them out.. does that make me a cheater?  
Technically YES it does.. do I consider myself a cheater even if I 
don't use them.. well that is a good question.. I cheat to test 
them.. I cheat by making them.. but I don't use them often.. 
therefore yes I am a cheater.. do I care?  NO I could care less about 
how I cheat or not.. I am not complaining about cheaters I am 
complaining about people who lie or say that anti cheats are not 
cheats or the losers who think duping is not cheating.. gee what is 
their problem?  Blizzard doesn't just make hacks to try and stop 
duping for no damn reason!  Now.. if I were to have never started 
making hacks would I have started cheating?  Prob test them.. I cheat 
by making them.. but I don't use them often.. therefore yes I am a 
cheater.. do I care?  NO I could care less about how I cheat or not..

cheaters I am complaining about people who lie or say	O.K. I can see 
this is getting to be a long post.. well I don't care.. I am now 
going to ask what YOU think it might have been if cheating never came 
up.. I personally think that people would have had something better 
to do like maybe more pks or something but I want to know what YOU 
think would have been.. not like it matters since its already done.. 
cheaters are always on battle.net and probably will be there till 
b.net is gone.

	O.K. on to another part.. heh long post isn't it?  O.K... now that 
we got the part about cheaters being stupid some time.. lets get back 
on what exactly do you think is cheating?  Is it cheating when you 
backup for system crashes?  Is it cheating when you dupe?  Is it 
cheating when you change you acct?  Is name change cheating?  Is it 
cheating if you use unlimited gold?  Is it cheating if you use Tk? Is 
it cheating if you make hacks?  Is it cheating if you find a way to 
do something that isn't supposed to be built in?  Well its all an 
opinion.. I personally don't care nowadays.

	O.K. I am not going to waste any more of your time with this.. maybe 
later (Wednesday) I will bring up another wonderful issue.. it is now 
going to go on to a &#34;lighter&#34; note.. I have started -
