<pre>I read about Tracy_lords's post about THEMAN.
I was disgusted.  Tracy_lords is evil (as always been).  

I tell you some of Tracy's little plots.
You see, many people in INFERNO --HATE-- THEMAN, so if Tracy say 
THEMAN is the LEADER of INFERNO, some people will run out and JOIN 
PoC.  That is Tracy's first plot

Second Plot is that:
Many people in B.net are --ENEMY-- of THEMAN, so if Tracy say 
&#34;THEMAN&#34; is the leader of INFERNO, bunch of us will try to 
flame INFERNO.  

Third Plot:  
I guess that Tracy want INFERNO to Fall PERMANTLY.  Tracy want to be 
a Leader of PoC, and she want to take over INFERNO at the same time.  
Tracy is ambitious.  


---Tracy's Biggest Mistake: EUGENE---

Maybe, this was Tracy's big ambitious plan since when she joined 
INFERNO, TO BECOME A LEADER.  Well, she can't hide from my eyes.  
With Eugene beside her pussom(?), I can't get a rid feeling that she 
had done it with EUGENE.  As I told you, you can't trust INFERNO nor 
PoC.  It is a mistake that Tracy brought Eugene to her 
guild...History tells us about our mistakes, don't let is happen to 
you Tracy...

I can't even believe that PoC accepted RACIST like Eugene, if I was a 
leader I wouldn't.  Tracy let Eugene be part of her gang, because of 
his skill.  But I tell you that Eugene is a walking explosive.

I hope PoC will not turn into some kind of HARD-CORE White Power 
group.  With Eugene at side, I can't get a rid of feeling of PoC 
turned into a Eugene's little toy.  Eugene is a mastor of tung, he 
can eliminate you all in sec with his mouth.  

My fortune cookie tells me that Eugene will be a leader of PoC.  
Cookie does not lie! :)


S-R

p.s.  Don't say I didn't warned you.</pre>
