<pre>A while back someone in the strategy forum posted claiming that he 
could block four out of five witches' blood stars and half the 
advocates' fireballs with his shield. He drew a few flames from 
people saying that this was impossible; occasionally you blocked one, 
but the cases were few and far between. But intrigued, I decided to 
do some research.

First, I noticed that you &#34;dodge&#34; blood stars completely 
based on your DEX. While standing still, Lepthana would only get hit 
about half the time- the rest of the time the bloodstars would pass 
right on by. Increasing/decreasing AC and resists had no effect on 
this, but I think that putting on +DEX stuff did, though the change 
between 250 DEX and 330 DEX was hard to determine. Later tests showed 
that my warrior Thelmonan wouldn't dodge nearly as many, so I'm 
relatively confident in that asessment.

Putting a shield on Lept, I first noticed that she didn't block 
anything. Adding/removing plate and helm had no effect on this. They 
either missed completely or I took it on the chin. However, when I 
stripped her of her resistances, suddenly the sheild came alive. She 
managed to block most of what came her way. Again, AC didn't seem to 
have an effect.

Intrigued, I switched to my warrior and his array of shields:

Stormshield
Godly shield of the ages (AC 54)
Emerald shield of the tiger (+50&#37;, +47 HP, AC 14)
Buckler (AC 1, purchased just for the occasion)

I first tried the godly shield. Again I noticed that he started 
blocking blood stars after I stripped him of all his magic resistance 
and fireballs after all fire resist was gone (note on blocking 
fireballs: you often end up taking blast damage from them when 
blocked, though not always, maybe 50&#37; of the time). I then 
switched to the emerald shield, in the hopes that perhaps with it I 
could get the resistance and the blocking at the same time- sadly, it 
was not so. The emerald shield refused to block anything. The buckler 
did a comperable job to the godly shield, so I'm pretty confident 
that the AC on the shield doesn't matter. The stormshield did wonders-
 NOTHING got through while I was standing still. An array of a half 
dozen witches couldn't touch me- to prove it I walked away from the 
computer and ate lunch, when I came back I still hadn't been hit. So 
I was hopeful at this point that I'd discovered something worthwhile.

However, testing under battle conditions failed miserably. While 
walking, the shield doesn't seem to block anything at all, and while 
trying to swing the sword it's terribly disruptive as your shield 
blocks ten blood stars in a row before you can attack again. The end 
result was that even the stormshield couldn't knock out enough of 
them to make it worth not having any resists, making the research 
somewhat disappointing. 

However, if you've got low resists (say, &#60; 25&#37;) and use a 
shield, it might work better to forget the resists and use the shield 
as your magic defense. Also I haven't tried it out in a player vs. 
player situation, so I don't know how it'll react to that (if you 
didn't have the blast damage to worry about, a way to duel mages 
would be to stand still and let them fireball their mana away!).
