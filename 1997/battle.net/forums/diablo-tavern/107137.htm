<pre>Gotta agree with that. I could use a little time with the blocks, 
too. Heh! Just gimme some cookies to drink and I'll be all set!

Nice thoughts!

Best Regards,

ZelRiptha

p.s. Good luck on the smoking thing - that can be tough.

&#62; Today was particularly hard to get through. It was one of those slow, 
&#62; uninspired, you can feel each footstep as you drag your self to your 
&#62; next remedial task kinda days. 
&#62; 
&#62; Do we build things anymore?
&#62; do we invent things anymore?
&#62; 
&#62; Im so confused and out of touch with the illusion of the 
&#62; &#34;real&#34; world that sometimes I sit in awe of the madness.
&#62; Even greater is my confusion,considering that I am a college student, 
&#62; and am supposedly learning the skills I need to succeed.
&#62; 
&#62; When I was in kindergarden we had nap time
&#62; why?
&#62; why not now?
&#62; Doesn't it seem rational that the adults who are pulling the 9 hour 
&#62; work shifts need an hour of sleep somewhere in the mix.
&#62; Was a day of playing with blocks,drinking cookies, and learning the 
&#62; fine art of bladder control so overwhelmingly difficult, and 
&#62; overbearingly exhausting that an hour of napping was needed?
&#62; Me thinks not
&#62; 
&#62; On top of ever growing pile of doo-doo , I am making a half hearted 
&#62; attempt to quit smoking,down to about three a day and feeling great 
&#62; ........well........ feeling something nonetheless
&#62; 
&#62; I am just thankful that I am not a paranoid delusional, with a 
&#62; serious Diablo addiction
&#62; &#34;You want me to go for a walk?????.....but there might be pk's 
&#62; out there!!!&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; That kinda thing...........
&#62; 
&#62; Well here are some words of advice for everyone before I call this 
&#62; post quits........
&#62; 
&#62; If ever life is getting overwhelming,......if all the problems you 
&#62; could imagine are coming at you at once, .........you find your self 
&#62; terrified , alone , and ever so vulnerable..............head for a 
&#62; doorway.............and deal with those problems one at a time. :)</pre>
