&#62; &#62; let's start off with the fact that i don't cheat
&#62; &#62; and let's move on to the fact that u do..
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; you told me yerself &#34;i use diablo hack to gain levels&#34;
&#62; &#62; or &#34;don't try to kill me..i have infinite mana&#34;
&#62; &#62; i also have screenshots of u saying that...
&#62; &#62; so u ran b4 u got kicked
&#62; &#62; loser
&#62; 
&#62; Hey, Flux (aka Fai-Yen)
&#62; 
&#62; You remember me from a few hours ago? We were in Snakegod channel, 
&#62; and you (as Fai-Yen, low level rogue) asked for a game. I joined, 
&#62; (Fool, level 3 Sorcerer).
&#62; I suspected something when I saw a rogue running around with a sword 
&#62; instead of a bow. Bottom of the Church stairs, BAM I was dead. I 
&#62; restarted in town.The dialogue went something like this:
&#62; 
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: how was that?
&#62; &#60;Fool&#62;: how was what?
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: the kill
&#62; &#60;Fool&#62;: so so
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: Eugene would kill for that
&#62; &#60;Fool&#62;: you already did
&#62; &#60;Fool&#62;: so who are you really?
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: guess who I am
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: I am an INFERNO leader
&#62; &#60;Fool&#62;: nuh uh. I asked first.
&#62; &#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: okay. Im flux
&#62; 
&#62; I then proceeded to enlighten you as to style in Pkilling, stating 
&#62; that you should use a bow if you wanted to be inconspicuous, to which 
&#62; you replied that you preferred being loud. You went on about how you 
&#62; killed &#34;cheesy creamer&#34; (I assume you meant Easy-
&#62; Dreamer/Possum) lots, he seemed to enjoy it. You said you were a 
&#62; sadist.
&#62; 
&#62; Then the good bit:
&#62; 
&#62; You asked me if I wanted to help you practice pking.
&#62; Sure, why not. But first, I asked that you post about it on ogden's 
&#62; once we were done, to which you said okay. Where's the post?
&#62; 
&#62; Also, after you killed me a few more times, I lay there rather than 
&#62; restart. You started swinging an axe over my corpse. I nearly fell 
&#62; out of my chair laughing. Then you started going on about how with 
&#62; your &#60;insert prefix which provides +100 something to hit&#62; 
&#62; sword of slaughter and YOUR GNARLED ROOTS, you could hit through AC 
&#62; 500.
&#62; 
&#62; Want to tell me again how you don't cheat? Let's see that quote again:
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; let's start off with the fact that i don't cheat
&#62; &#62; and let's move on to the fact that u do..
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Wow. So Flux is a liar as well as a cheater. I wont go on about 
&#62; style, because you obviously don't care. I'll just leave you with 
&#62; your own words again;
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; loser

hmm...
well i killed you allright...
now u go and tell shit about me in tavern?..
well well..
to every1 else: letme clear this ...
i have a strange sword of slaughter (and eugene would KILL for that)
+149&#37; to-hit, +16 to dmg
and a godly kite shield (courtesy to MinionX)
and a ruby ring of titans, a sparking mail, a ring of titans and an
amulet of perfection.... ohh and top that w/ a saintly helm of skill
all those items give me...a nice to hit of around 260&#37; (at lvl 6)
well...does that make me a cheater?
does it?
ask  yer foolish friend here..

ps: and that axe as very wicked..
(weird axe of haste +100&#37; to-hit fastest attack and it's a great 
axe..)
thanx again, minionx</pre>
