<pre>For those who DO play console games, you might own a playstation.

Now, for those who do, you may have heard of Final Fantasy games by a 
company called Squaresoft, one of the most respected video game 
companies in Japan AND the US and they have made all quality games 
that have gotten huge sales (with the exception of the dreaded Secret 
of Evermore..that game WAS bad)

But, Final Fantasy 7 is coming out.....but what is it?

Final Fantasy is a game on 3 CD's for Playstation to be released on 
September 7 in the US, and then later for Windows 95 in early 98.

The game is, without a doubt, to be a GREAT game...but how so?

Simple.  EVERYTHING.

First of all, see the graphics.  For Eye Candy, it is VERY sweet 
Candy. :)  Then check out some FMV and AVI....NICE.

It has a killer soundtrack (not redbook Audio, though, but 
GREAT...best song is One-Winged Angel on the Cd Soundtrack)

It has an innovative battle system for RPGs of this classic nature. 
(not point and click, just commands like &#34;Fight&#34; and 
&#34;Item&#34; and such.

It has fluid animation, and unlike most FF games with little Japanese 
characters (Kefka rings a bell, even though many consider him the 
best video game Villian of all time, as I do...he at least makes 
almost EVERY damn top ten list I see on here for villians :), it has 
full sized characters for fighting.

It has ten characters to play as:  Cloud (main Hero), Barett (Big 
Burly Rebel Leader), Tifa (Powerful, Agile Waitress), Aerith 
(Magician and Flower Shop Owner), Vincent (Mysterious Man), Cat Sith 
(Cat riding a Stuff Moogle, and a Gambler to boot :), Yufi (Ninja 
Girl), Cid (Airship Captain, Chain Smoker), Red XIII (Beast and 
Astrologer), and Sephiroth (General, and one of the most powerful 
character I have ever seen personally for a game).

It has MANY Villians:  President ShinRa (Ruler of the ShinRa 
Corporation, cares only about money), Rufus ShinRa (Wants control of 
the company, VERY sick and evil), Palmer (Rocket Scientist with a 
lazy Streak), Scarlett (Weapons Developer with an Evil Streak), 
Heideggar (Odd one eyed guy, leader of the Soldiers and Turks), Hojo 
(Head of Science with a Mad streak through him), Reeve (Head of 
Building Development and a former dresser), and the Turks (A group of 
Four elite &#34;cleaners&#34; who take care of stuff for ShinRa).  
Also, MANY Others, I hear, including a supreme evil bad guy :)

It has an interesting battle system.

It has hype, and everyone is voting it the best game of all time 
already.

Well, is it worth it?

One thing lacking...multiplayer.

But, besides that, it looks KILLER.

Go check it out at <a href="http://www.sqla.com/unoffial/">http://www.sqla.com/unoffial/</a> 

I think the site may be down now for updating of their page, but it 
WILL be back.

FF7 will be great....but do not take my word for it, go check it out, 
just don't read the spoilers. :)
