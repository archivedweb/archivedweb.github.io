&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
&#62; 
&#62; No, gold is so comon.  However, use good sence, i wouldn't hand a 
&#62; newbie 200k, however if i was in a duel and the other guy ran out of 
&#62; cash, then of course i'd give him a bit o' gold.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes, unless you have something of equal value to trade with, or if 
&#62; the item was found on the same level both of you were fighting on.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes, to a small degree.  However, if its a level 40 buying awesome 
&#62; plate for a level 2, then i'd say its cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; &#62; elixers?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes.  Same as above.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
&#62; 
&#62; hmm, tough call.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; &#62; Adria or Griz for items?
&#62; 
&#62; No.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples 
&#62; &#62;stats?
&#62; 
&#62; No.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; &#62; could not regularly access?
&#62; 
&#62; Technically yes.  But if the low leveler thinks he can handle it, 
&#62; then sure.  However, if he was portalled in just to be pick-up boy, 
&#62; then its cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; &#62; items?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  Consider it like this: Your character becomes a hero and is 
&#62; famous, it is only natural he have squires and servants and such.  
&#62; Heck, with the amount of gold i've dragged out of the labrinth, i 
&#62; should have my own storage castle.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
&#62; 
&#62; Not if the characters are of close level to eachother.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
&#62; 
&#62; No.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
&#62; 
&#62; No. But its damned cheap.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes, that would involve town kill.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  But it is if you backup after an mk. 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#60;---!begin more questions---&#62;
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Change character names?
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Mkill someone?
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Change accts on battle.net
&#62; 
&#62; Yes to the above 3.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Transfer characters to another computer?
&#62; 
&#62; No.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Run Diablo off your hard drive?
&#62; 
&#62; No.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to Use utilities that allow things such as Ghost 
&#62; &#62; See?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to use other chat utilities such as Diapolis? 
&#62; &#62; (ask a snakegod member what it is)
&#62; 
&#62; Don't know what it is.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it cheating to transfer single player characters to 
&#62; &#62; multiplayer?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes.  Different items and system of money in single player.
&#62; 
&#62; Dammit.  I hate doing battle.net homework.  No more of this.  Should 
&#62; anyone ever post a questionaire involving math work, i'll take an Ace 
&#62; spot and pk his sorry ass.
&#62; 
&#62; later.
