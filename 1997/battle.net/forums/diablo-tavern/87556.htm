<pre>I talked to Mikedog, flux-babe...he realized you were acting like a 
power hungry cheater.  (As usual)

Mikedog and I are going to Freelance in UO, as friends, so I can have 
some fun.

PoC?  Good luck.  Eugene?  Look for me, and maybe you may beat me in 
UO. Wishes do come true :)

But, basically, I say this....

I find PoC as quitters...but, guys, a suggestion...

Change your name to &#34;INFERNO.&#34;

No offense to the remaining INFERNO, like FireBrand, Lionel, etc, you 
are all great guys, nice guys....

I hope to say hi and buy you a tasty beverage in UO.  And you are all 
welcome to help me get the stone...then we can make a floating 
Castle. :)  After we get a floating Castle, we can make Sex-Rogue's 
little one person guild &#34;light up&#34; for a long time. :)

PoC?  Do not worry....I flamed you all I want, and still will as I 
see fit....and Tracy, we still duel on Friday.

fist?  you are damn strong :)

And flux-babe?  You are not going to decide my fate.  I REFUSE to 
have your cheating, two-timing, Eugene loving ass decide anything for 
me.

Yes, people, flux-babe DOES cheat....Anubis cloned her, and he cheats 
now, but trust me, we already knew she cheated.  Flux-babe cheats her 
ass off.

I do not quit INFERO to have fun, to gain power...I quit because I 
think flux-babe is a moron, and Mikedog and I want to have some fun 
freelancing, and he and I stick together, PERIOD.  He is not INFERNO, 
so I am leaving.

You can't throw me out, flux, even with a vote.  But I QUIT.

And to the remaining INFERNO, keep in touch, I will still hang around 
INFERNO, and I WANT you to stay INFERNO to restore it to its former 
greatness.

Sad, really, I thought this would all work....

Oh well.  Consider me power hungry or not, and I bet I could stay in 
INFERNO and become a &#34;leader,&#34; but I do not want it.

Flux babe, on the other hand, does.

So, Lionel, AK, Jaded, etc, stay in INFERNO.  If you don't, go join 
Mayhem or PoC or something and have fun.  And remember, Tyrael, 
Fusion, PrimE, Tal'Rashid, AK Legacy, James Hetfield, Protectorate, 
FireBrand, Naga_Sadow, etc, you guys ARE going to join me in UO for a 
few sessions of PK, co-op, and basically bsing in the local tavern :)

So, I bid good bye to INFERNO.....not over threats, not over the 
basic hate campaign against me, but for one reason...

I am going to have fun, too.  And I am not going to let flux-babe 
destroy INFERNO in front of my eyes.  I REFUSE to watch her try and 
take over.

So, flux, I know you basically planned this all along. :)

And PoC?  Flux-babe is planning to become friends with you and then 
bring you guys back to INFERNO, &#34;back stab&#34; you, if you will.

Talk behind my back, flux, and I will talk behind yours. :)

So, I am now freelancing in UO.  Mikedog and I will probably have 
lots of fun. :)

So, gentlemen, and you too, flux, have fun.  I know I will now. :)

The Man (Will Freelance for Food)

P.S.  I may even start a &#34;group&#34; of freelancers to just 
travel around and get paid, and we can even try and get that floating 
castle. :)

P.P.S.  PoC?  Good luck.

P.P.P.S.  Snow, if I insulted you, I am sorry.  I know you think of 
me as an ass, and you can, but accept my humble apology.  :I truly am 
sorry for what I said to you.

P.P.P.P.S.  Tracy?  We still duel Friday.</pre>
