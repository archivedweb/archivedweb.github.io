<pre>Well because of certian events this story has been takeing longer
than it should but in any case here's part one and the next should
be out no sooner than next week because I'm going away 4 a week to
the middle of noware(Not a computer for MILES!!).  BTW: Black Magic 
would repesent Cheating incase you don't get it and I should also 
mention this story is completely fictional and I tryed useing e-mails 
and conversations with the people I use as characters to really make 
this cool.  Hope you like.......


Part One:  3am, Behind Ogden’s Tavern

&#34;Why? For what possible reason do you need me for.&#34;  The Man 
stood confused at why
anyone would possible attempt to take over INFERNO.  Yes there were 
many arguments
that had been pulling the guild apart for a time but to lead up 
against Tracy Lords for
control of INFERNO was just insane.
&#34;Because you have respect in INFERNO and people will follow you.  
If we can get you and a
couple others like Morte, and SnowRabbit there might be a chance 
others will follow.&#34;  The
short scrony man said with pride in his voice.
&#34;You'll never turn Snow Rabbit, she’s to loyal to INFERNO.  
Listen, leading a revolt will
take a lot more then you me and Morte.&#34;  The Man stood there 
thinking how this could be 
accomplished, then he suddenly snapped back realizing how inane this 
conversation was.  Only it was to
late, The Man had already given all that Set  needed.  &#34;This is 
stupid, why would I want to  
try taking control of INFERNO, plus Tracy isn't the problem Eugene 
is.&#34;
&#34;Fine, if you don't want in then you don't want in as long a you 
remember that this
conversation never happened.&#34;  Set said covering his a*s.
&#34;Yea, yea what ever.  Best of luck to you, your going to need it 
with what your planing.  The Man wasn’t one to let something like 
this go forgotten but he didn’t think there was a chance that Set 
could do it.  And he was right, Set could never pull off taking over 
INFERNO but he wasn’t alone.

The sword barely skinned his head, cutting of a small peice of flesh 
form PegLegBoy’s head.  Only the swipe wasn’t ment to merle scalp 
him, but to separate his head from the rest of his body.  A idea 
PegLeg preferred did not happen.   With this swing the warrior had 
exposed himself as his arm was fully extended right above PegLegBoy’s 
sword, and with a quick reflection Peg had severed the mans arm.  
&#34;Arggg!!&#34;  He cried out in pain as his arm twitched on the 
floor, lying in a pool of crimson.  
&#34;You little,&#34; Peg spoke with a rage he had felt few times 
before.  He leaned down and picked up
the torn flesh that had once been apart of his head.  &#34;You don’t 
deserve to die but I have no time to deal with you.&#34;  With that 
PegLeg slit the nameless warriors throat, and hastily cutting off his 
ear.  Now for the other one Peg thought to himself.  
	PegLeg had left his position as leader, and founder of INFERNO quite 
some time ago and now had been residing quietly at his home just 
outside of Trenton.  Very few even knew of its existence, Tracy 
Lords, to which he left command of INFERNO to knew and another friend 
who had retired.  Only somehow these two warriors had found his home, 
and for some reason thought they could surprise PegLegBoy during the 
night in a attempt to kill him.  What fools.
	PegLeg inched around the corners of his house, soundless.  Then from 
his bedroom where he had slayed the first one a creek was let out by 
the wooden floor.  With this Peg turned and ran down the hall back to 
his room, by the time he had reached it his window was open and the 
second man was gone.  
	&#34;No your not.&#34;  Peg exclaimed as he jumped through the 
window just in time to see a shadowy figure disappear behind a group 
of trees.   Now I’ve got you Peg though to himself, running at full 
velocity towards the trees.  When he reached the trees the man had 
gotten away again, but had caught his cloths on a tree branch leaving 
a clue to his identity.  Still Peg was upset that he had let this 
fellow get away, he felt that maybe he needed to get back in shape or 
even come out of retirement for a while.  The pain from his wound had 
just began to really set in and Peg turned to go back inside.  He got 
very little sleep that night for all he could think was that had to 
find out who had tried to kill him, and take revenge.

	&#34;Cronos not like you!&#34;  Ogden’s was filled with a more then 
usual element of filth that night, or early morning what ever you 
wish to call it.  In a corner sat Cronos, a tall rather good looking 
she though blond.  Cronos spoke in incomplete sentences, and never 
made much sense most of the time but those who knew him best had long 
since realized it never slowed her down in battle.  Next to her sat 
Sniper a well build, middle aged man that looked up to INFERNO with 
almost childlike envy, and lastly sat the three SnakeGod members that 
sat across the table and had just lost at poker.
	&#34;You cheated, INFERNO always cheats.&#34;  ---- yelled as he 
stood leaning across the table as if to pick a fight.
	Cronos just sat there a moment and then responded with, &#34;If we 
cheat why play poker with us?&#34;
	Again there was a moment of silence as the group thought it over, 
and then frustrated that Cronos not only beat him in poker but the 
argument ---- reached across the table and slapped her, open hand.  
Sniper jumped to his feet drawing his sword which provoked all eyes 
in the bar to turn at the corner which the five had been playing 
poker.  
	&#34;It ok Sniper.&#34;  Cronos said as she stood, &#34;they are 
right we will leave.&#34;  Cronos turned to leave and took one step 
before snapping back around to deliver a rather powerful blast to ----
 chest, not only knocking the wind out of him be sending him flying 
back against the wall.  This sent the bar into a state of chaos, 
Sniper dropped his sword and jumped across the table arms extended 
outward so that he would hit both SnakeGod members.
	Hordes of people came running in the bars entrance to join the brawl 
as all Ogden could do was watch and think of what he could buy with 
the money in damages he would get from INFERNO.  The guild may have 
been made up of back stabers, and killers but they treated Ogden well 
and he would be compensated for the expenses.  With this crowd of 
people was the only two that really mattered, The Man, and Set.  
	During the battle it was so chaotic that you barely knew who was 
fighting who, and this was Set’s chance.  He moved to a quiet spot 
underneath the bar and pulled out his dagger from a hidden sheath 
under his cloths.  Then Set scanned the for his target, bingo.  He 
stood and weaseled his way through the bar, then grabbing onto his 
targets shirt he cut a small piece and left.

	&#34;What do you mean ‘Old School’ tactics?&#34;  Peg was utterly 
confused with Acidic Overdose’s response to his plan for killing the 
Mage that they had tricked into following them to the Caves outside 
Trenton.   	
	&#34;I mean that’s the old way to assassinate.  What we need to do 
is argue over if you black magic because your hit points are so high, 
then I’ll get him into thinking your out to get him and tell him that 
I’m going to try and take kill you.  This way he trusts me.&#34;  
Acidic explained acting a little cocky.
	&#34;And you don’t think we used to pull that kinda stuff, man shut 
up about your ‘old school’ and we’ll use your plan.&#34;  PegLeg 
spoke trying not to laugh.
	&#34;So when you going to come back to INFERNO Peg?&#34;  Acidic 
asked off the subject.
	&#34;I don’t know.&#34;  Peg said, because he truly did not know, 
&#34;if I’m going to come back at all.&#34;
	&#34;Ok, lets start Peg.  Oh, and remind me to ask you what happened 
to your skull later.  Thats a pretty good scar off the top of your 
head.&#34;  Acidic said falling back a little so to stand next to the 
mage who had been walking behind them.
	&#34;Why you are pretty buff for someone who just started working 
out two weeks ago Kermit.&#34;  Acidic asked Peg in a elevated voice 
using his fake name that the two had chosen before going out.
	&#34;Do you use black magic?&#34;  The mage asked.
	&#34;No, of course not.  Its just that I have a magical cap, and no 
it doesn’t use black magic.&#34;
	Acidic turned his head to face the Mage and then whispered, &#34;I 
don’t trust him, I say we take him now before he trys to kill 
us.&#34;  
	The Mage turned to Acidic and spoke with out trying to conseale his 
words from PegLeg at the slightest, &#34;You want to back stab 
Kermit!&#34;  With this the mage took a step back turning his back to 
PegLeg, or Kermit as he knew him, so that he could face Acidic. 
	&#34;Big mistake!&#34;  PegLegBoy exclaimed as he ran his sword 
through the mage’s back.  The silver colored metal just bearly peeked 
through his stomach sending blood flying onto Acidic’s loosely warn 
shirt.
	&#34;Ah, man Peg!  Now I have to wash my shirt again.&#34;  Acidic 
said as the mage collapsed before him onto the floor.  Then Acidic 
jumped back saying, &#34;hey don’t you dare bleed on my new boots 
dead man!&#34;

	&#34;Hey guys what’s this?&#34;  Tracy Lords asked looking at a note 
tacked up to Ogden tavern’s message board.  All most all of INFERNO’s 
active members had showed up to help clean up their mess at Ogden’s 
and Tracy had taken a break to read all the posts on the board for 
the day.
	&#34;What’s the Problem Trace?&#34;  Snow Rabbit asked with a smile 
walking over to the message board where Tracy was standing.
	&#34;Well it looks like a post from PegLeg saying that there is to 
be a INFERNO meeting at his cabin just outside of town tonight at 
sundown.  Could this be real?&#34;  Tracy looked up to Snow Rabbit 
with a questioning face.
	&#34;PegLeg has a cabin?&#34; 

	The tip of the sun was just sticking over the horizon so that the 
sky was lit up in a bright orange.  A group had gathered out side 
PegLeg’s home all discussing what this meeting could be about.  
Almost all of INFERNO had showed up, and Peg was very surprised to 
all have them on his porch when he awoke from his slumber he had 
taken after he and Acidic Overdose had finished their little ear 
collection outing.
	As Peg opened his front do with confusion he whispered to himself, 
&#34;By the secret of the cows what is this?&#34;
	James Hertfeild noticing PegLeg was now joining their ranks out in 
the open field he pointed to him tapping on Flux Babe on the 
shoulder.  Flux turned and spoke to Peg surprised at his rather out 
of shape figure.  She always had a thing for PegLeg and she didn’t 
want to see him like this, in anycase she forced herself to look at 
him and speak.  &#34;Peg why have you called us here,  what has 
happened?&#34;
	&#34;Called you here?  What are you talking about, where is 
Tracy?&#34;  After a moment of scanning the group of forty or so and 
noted for his good eye site he noticed that The Man had a slight tear 
off the end of his shirt.
	&#34;The Man where did you get that tear off your shirt!&#34;  Peg 
commanded.
	&#34;Huh?&#34;  He answered.
	&#34;The tear on the end of your shirt, where did you get it?&#34;  
He restated his question. 
	Looking down at the tear The Man said, &#34;I don’t know maybe in 
the brawl at Ogdens.&#34;
	Peg not moving his eyes off of the tear marched through the crowed 
right up to The Man and felt the material of his shirt.  &#34;You 
tried to kill me.&#34;  Peg said eyes wide open.  &#34;You…..&#34;  
He had trusted The Man and never thought that anyone in INFERNO would 
ever try to betray him.  
After a moment of absolute silence a lone voice spoke in shock, 
&#34;Holy Sh*t, KoR!&#34;
All eyes turned from The Man to a hill off in the east’s now barely 
lit skyline.  There stood a good hundred and fifty warriors, rogues, 
and wizards all fitted for battle.  &#34;It was a trap, you lead us 
into a trap.&#34;  Peg murmured quietly to The Man as he stood there 
with out a word of defense for what could he say, and if he did 
defend him self would anyone listen?  Either way it wasn’t the time 
for this matter now all of the INFERNO could concentrate on was 
staying alive.
