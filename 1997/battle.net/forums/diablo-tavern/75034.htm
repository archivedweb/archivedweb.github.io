&#62; As few of you know, me and IronFisT have built levels in a small, non-

&#62; Pirates of Dark Water, the non-cheating guild's afore mentioned UO 
&#62; guild, has been offered our alliance. 
&#62; 
&#62; SERIOUSLY, they aren't even pks. Their motto is &#34;you have to know 
&#62; someone to kill them&#34;. PLEASE people thats pathetic. Their 
&#62; &#34;Da Master Plan&#34; is to beat and bully NPCs. 
&#62; This is the kind guild we should kill not ally with. Their pathetic --
&#62;  at one point their Diablo version wanted to goto war with inferno 
&#62; (we chose inferno and we kicked out for it).
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Get back to me Tracy_lords, Prime, Fist, Pegleg, Snowrabbit, Morte, 
&#62; and other inferno leaders.

Ok, they will have a navy, ships, etc.  They have DavidD, former 
INFERNO, and friend.  I will not make war with them and I will be 
pissed off if any INFERNO member makes threats towards them.  If we 
do not become allies with them, I still plan on being on good terms 
with them.  Also, they will kill people.  Don't get me wrong, we are 
evil pk, but Navy is not the INFERNO thing, and that is what their 
strongpoint will be.  Contact me via emai from our web page if you 
have any more questions.  Thanks.
