<pre>I finally got the CD today, and registered.  Took forever to get 
online, but I did get in and spent about an HOUR without a single 
crash.  It was incredible.  The game is mucho improved over phase 1, 
with less lag and obviously more stability.  The only problem was a 
shortage of animals... everybody was looking for a bunny to bash.  
I did find one fierce opponent.... a RAT.  That's right, my first 
fight in phase 2 was with a rat.  Fortunately I won.  I ran into a 
cougar, but decided not to try my luck since I'm stuck with a dagger.
Checking my backpack revealed a better inventory than with phase 1.  
As a warrior I started with a shield, and a long sword.  
Unfortunately, I'm too weak to use the sword..... hence, the dagger.

ICQ works with UO!  BLZ_BOB and I tried for an hour to hook up in 
Vesper, but he was experiencing some major lag and never could get 
rolling.  With ICQ running, you can chat while you play... otherwise 
I am not sure you can communicate with other players while in 
Britannia.

There were 1200 players online at once tonight; we got the message 
just before they shut down the servers for a 10 minute break.

My impressions of phase 2:  MUCH BETTER.  The game is actually 
playable now.  Still obviously BETA though.  I found a bunch of 
practice dummies, but couldn't swing at them.  Every time I tried to 
practice, I got the message, &#34;you have to wait until it stops 
swinging&#34;.  I guess the game thought I had already swung, and hit 
the dummy.  So, I wasn't able to get any practice that way.  I'm 
hoping that bug is corrected soon so I can build my strength and use 
the sword.  

I also saw a PC attack and kill another PC in town..... NO GUARDS 
showed up to save him!  So.... it looks like the NPC guards need 
tweaking a little, at least in Vesper.

Let me know if you folks want to hear more.  I plan to log back in 
early tomorrow.</pre>
