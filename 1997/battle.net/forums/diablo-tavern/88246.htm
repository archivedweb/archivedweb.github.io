&#62; As I was reading the thread, I was getting more and more irritated at 
&#62; all the whining going on. It was to the point that I was going to 
&#62; post something on the 1st page. Fortunately, Discordia posted here a 
&#62; message with which I can mostly agree. I am also grateful and happy 
&#62; to live in those times and in a place where consumption and 
&#62; materialism are highly valued. Only in those circumstances can true 
&#62; freedom be achieved and exercised. In an anthill society that Wiseman 
&#62; seems to be advocating (no individual waste, everyone working for the 
&#62; good of the collective) there's no individual lifestyle choice 
&#62; possible, while in the materialistic society one can pursue happiness 
&#62; in any way he desires (also by asceticism that Wiseman seems to 
&#62; propose).
&#62; A couple of myths that seem to return no matter what the facts.
&#62; 
&#62; Golden age: in the past things were better, people cared for each 
&#62; other, there was little crime, and no pollution. Luckily Discordia 
&#62; has already broken up some of that: disease and lack of hygiene that 
&#62; are inherent to non-industrial societies were abundant in the past. 
&#62; Some interesting statistics show, that also crime rate in the past 
&#62; was much higher than in the present. As to people beeing more 
&#62; caring...well did anyone hear about Maslov's chierarchy of needs? No 
&#62; way people were more considerate of others back then. Maybe they 
&#62; worked closer together at times, but that was only when the survival 
&#62; of the entire population was at stake: be it famine, war or natural 
&#62; disaster. If there ever was a period in human history we can call 
&#62; &#34;golden age&#34; it is the one we are living in.
&#62; 
&#62; Corporate Empires. I cannot understand that one at all. Seems like 
&#62; the opponents of &#34;waste&#34; should be in favor of big 
&#62; corporations. They are much more efficient than small business, just 
&#62; like trains are more efficient than cars. Also, the big corporations 
&#62; are probably the best places to aork at. They provide the widest 
&#62; range of benefits, and sense of security, that so many people above 
&#62; seemed to long for. As to corporate &#34;waste&#34; on advertising... 
&#62; a brief look into the budgets would reveal that only about 5&#37; of 
&#62; the profit is spent on advertising. To whine about 5&#37; and not see 
&#62; where the other 95 is going is just the type of thinking that got me 
&#62; irritated to the point of writing this lengthy post.
&#62; 
&#62; Want to complain about waste in present society? Consider this: 
&#62; 50&#37; of the U.S. GNP ends up in the government's hand. Now, this 
&#62; is a very low figure for a &#34;civilized&#34; country. In Europe 
&#62; that figure is closer to 70&#37;. Now, what happens to the money that 
&#62; the government gets? Some 10&#37; is spent on maintaining peace and 
&#62; security through the justice system, police and the military. Some 
&#62; gets invested in public works which could be done much cheaper by 
&#62; private initiative. But most of that money is completely wasted on 
&#62; bureaucracy and redistribution that do not benefit the society one 
&#62; bit. So there, corporations &#34;waste&#34; maybe 5&#37; of their 
&#62; profit on advertising (all advertising makes up..oh maybe 1&#37; of 
&#62; the GNP), while governments get over 50&#37; of GNP to waste as they 
&#62; please and nobody seems to have a problem with that. More so, I am 
&#62; certain that many people who posted above would like to see 
&#62; governments &#34;take charge&#34; - meaning higher budgets.
&#62; 
&#62; I can go on and on explaining why Wiseman's &#34;objective&#34; world 
&#62; view is not one bit objective but determined by the same commercial 
&#62; news media that he probably dislikes so much. I think where the 
&#62; difference in opinion lies is a different view of mankind. Wiseman, 
&#62; and most authors above view mankind as &#34;fallen angels&#34; 
&#62; capable of perfection and life in harmony. Me, I see, a bunch of 
&#62; creatures with very limited intellectual capabilities who are trying 
&#62; to get along with each other and survive in hostile environment. They 
&#62; are stumbling along the way, but nevertheless they are making 
&#62; astonishing progress in every aspect of their quest.
