<pre>	Hehe. This tale reminds me of the first time I taught a few greedy 
humans a rather 'searing' lesson they never forgot (or spoke of again 
for that matter). Many thanks for sharing this peice of writing.

&#62;            From 'Arthur Rex' by Thomas Berger        
&#62; 
&#62;           ...and Arthur took one of the burning torches from its 
&#62;       bracket upon the wall and hurling aside a great tapesrty of
&#62;       Arras he thereby discovered a little doorway giving onto a
&#62;       spiral staircase that connected the throne room with 
&#62;       the lower regions of the castle.  Thrusting his torch ahead he
&#62;       led the lady through the doorway into the cellars, where there
&#62;       was a great chill of dampness and the odor of mold, and beyond
&#62;       the reach of the light the noise of scurryings could be heard.
&#62;       &#34;We have reached the treasury. It is guarded by a 
&#62; dwarf,&#34; King
&#62;       Arthur said smiling. &#34;Come let us rouse him, for he is a 
&#62; droll
&#62;       little fellow.&#34;
&#62;       At length a voice of high pitch came in answer: &#34;Which rogue
&#62;       doth disturb me?&#34;
&#62;       King Arthur cried, &#34;The King!&#34;
&#62;       There came the sound of bolts being withdrawn and at length the
&#62;       door opened so that a small face could be seen, and it was the
&#62;       height from the floor of a normal man at kneel.
&#62;       &#34;With a wench,&#34; said the dwarf disagreeably, and the 
&#62; lady did
&#62;       gasp at his impudence.  &#34;Come in or go away, the draught is
&#62;       chilling my tea.&#34;
&#62;       &#34;Whilst thou eateth thy tea,&#34; said Arthur, &#34;we 
&#62; shall just peek
&#62;       at my treasure.&#34;
&#62;       The dwarf clasped an iron ring on the floor, the which he
&#62;       raised, bringing a trap-door along with it. &#34;There's the 
&#62;       bleeding lode then,&#34; he huffed.
&#62;       The lady looked into the opening and saw gold and gems in a
&#62;       great heap the summit of which was so close that she could have
&#62;       knelt and with two hands gathered sufficient of it to buy a 
&#62;       kingdom.
&#62;       The dwarf found a pail with a rope attached, the which he
&#62;       carried to the hole and lowered thereinto. Fetching it up it
&#62;       brimmed over with golden coins and glittering jewels, some of 
&#62;       which fell out and clattered on the floor. A fat emerald bounced
&#62;       near the lady, who unobtrusively covered it with the instep of
&#62;       her slipper.
&#62;       Now King Arthur said to the lady, &#34;Choose a bauble for 
&#62; thyself.
&#62;       Take a winking sapphire or crystalline diamond, a carbuncle red
&#62;       as blood...&#34;
&#62;       &#34;Or the greenie she has got her hoof on,&#34; said the 
&#62; dwarf.
&#62;       She said uncovering the emerald, &#34;Ah, I did never know 'twas
&#62;       there.&#34;
&#62;       And she colored, not in shame but rather from hatred for the
&#62;       dwarf, whom she determined to have put to death when the castle
&#62;       was hers.
&#62;       &#34;A pretty thing it is,&#34; she said holding it so the 
&#62; light did
&#62;       flash verdantly through it. Then all at once she pitched the
&#62;       emerald into the vault.
&#62;       &#34;If a woman don't take one jewel,&#34; said the dwarf, 
&#62; &#34;then it's 
&#62;       that she doth want two.&#34;
&#62;           
&#62;           
&#62;           Later that night, as the castle slept, an armed party in the
&#62;       service of the lady gained entrance through a door giving onto
&#62;       the moat.  Being greedy men they looked immediately for the 
&#62;       treasury, with the idea of sacking it first and going afterwards
&#62;       to kill the sleeping population.
&#62;       Thus they sought and found the door behind which the dwarf slept
&#62;       over the treasure vault, and they knocked him up.  And when with
&#62;       even more bad humor than usual he opened the door and peeped
&#62;       out, these men, all great stout fellows, burst within, the
&#62;       foremost seizing the dwarf by the neck with the purpose to wring
&#62;       it like a goose.
&#62;       But the little neck swelled and burst from the grasp, becoming a
&#62;       serpentine throat covered with golden scales, surmounted by a
&#62;       great dragon's head with red eyes and enormous fangs and a snout
&#62;       from which came two bursts of flame which burned the brigand 
&#62;       into a cinder, and then the tail swung around collecting the
&#62;       entire party and they where likewise consumed by the flame.
&#62;       When this was done the fearsome beast transformed himself into a
&#62;       dwarf once again, who swept up the ashes with a little broom and
&#62;       dustpan and deposited them in the fireplace.
&#62; 
&#62;       For these rogues had forgotten that by tradition a dragon guards
&#62;       all royal lodes...
