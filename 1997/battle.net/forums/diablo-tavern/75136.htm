<pre>I went to the channel of the &#34;Order of the Lost&#34; today in 
hopes of perhaps having a sensible discussion with them. I read that 
Ishap, their leader, allegedly has a graduate education and I 
therefore hoped (in vain, as it turns out) that he might be capable 
of reasoned argument.

I went in with Puzzlebox and, since I wanted this to be above-board, 
I introduced myself as a member of Inferno. I then sat through the 
standard accusations of how Inferno cheats, etc. I asked them to turn 
D-eye on me. They (rather smugly) informed me that they had already 
done so, and stated that they thought my stats were a bit high. Mind 
you, Puzz is a level 38 Sorcerer with Dreamflange, a Thinking Cap 
(dur 21), two pieces of heaven’s jewelry  and a Serpent’s Ring of 
Titans, so my stats are indeed pretty good (their bases are maxed 
too, after all those potions I bought). All of these items were found 
by me personally, with the exception of the TC, which I got from a 
friend at dur 1. Perhaps they have so little experience with legit 
characters that they are unaware of what is possible for a powerful 
character to have.

Be that as it may, I rather patiently tried to explain to them that 
Inferno does not cheat (nor does it &#34;condone&#34; it ...). I 
explained that we have had problems with cheating members and, 
whenever possible, we have tried to throw cheaters out.

What they then revealed was that they really don’t care about 
cheating at all. All three members who were present admitted to using 
cheats &#34;when necessary&#34; – which to my mind goes quite a bit 
beyond even Ishap’s dictionary’s definition of &#34;condone&#34;. 
They are simply virulently anti-PK. In fact, one of their members 
made the rather amusing argument that &#34;We cheat to protect the 
non-cheaters&#34;. I’m afraid that they rather conveniently ignored 
my point that if you kill someone with a hacked character you are ... 
a cheater PK. 

At the end of this rather useless conversation I asked if they knew 
why Elijah was so angry at being accused of cheating. Ignoring the 
standard taunts, I said, &#34;He lost ALL of his characters last 
week. Did he go get dupes? NO. Did he hack his levels or bump up his 
stats? NO. He started over ...&#34;. To this one of the Order jeered, 
&#34;As a cheater!&#34; After rather tartly instructing this 
individual to refer back to what I just said, I just shrugged and 
left. 

These people are obviously so wrapped up in their own little 
prejudices that they cannot understand simple declarative sentences. 
Sad, really. And disappointing. If they were legit it would have been 
fun dodging them. I was also hoping for a little more intelligence, 
like I found in a recent conversation with Lepthana explaining why I 
would never join Snakegod.

Verdict: just another cheating guild, albeit one with a pretty 
nauseating streak of self-righteousness. It is destined to dry up and 
blow away in a month, just like all the rest. There is no need to pay 
it any further attention.

P.S. I related some of this to BLZ in chat and he went to their 
channel as FUZZY_BUNNY. One of them screamed &#34;It’s that bunny 
guy!&#34; and he was immediately banned. Somehow I don't think that 
speaks well of their courage ...</pre>
