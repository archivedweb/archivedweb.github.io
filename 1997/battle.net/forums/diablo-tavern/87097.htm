<pre>Dear S-R,

allow me to assist you in your travails with the English language.
I have carefully looked at your post and I offer the following 
corrections to help you in your attempts to communicate. Each 
correction has been highlighted in capitals, and is followed by a 
number in brackets because I was curious to see how many mistakes you 
could make in a single short posting.

&#62; Now, you can't join any public game to kill people.  How nice! :)

I AM PROUD (1) to announce that legit PKILLING is DEAD.
YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO (2) join any public games (3) AND (3) kill 
people. How nice! :)

&#62; Only way to pkilling is now DUEL.  Yup, your backstabbing days of 
&#62; pkilling has ended.  If you didn't notice, more than half of B.net 
&#62; citizens CHEAT.
&#62; 

THE (4) only way to PKILL is now TO (5) DUEL. Yup, your backstabbing 
days of pkilling HAVE (6) ended. If you didn't notice, more than half 
of B.net citizens CHEAT.

&#62; Now, only way to pkill other is to use CHEAT.  

Now, THE (7) only way to pkill ANOTHER (8) is to CHEAT.

&#62; I don't belief that you can now actually kill more than 20 per day. 

I don't BELIEVE (9) that you can now actually kill more than 20 per 
day. 

&#62; With this kind of situation, you MUST cheat to kill.  Now, that make 
&#62; you a cheater.  
&#62; 

IN (10) this kind of situation, you MUST cheat to kill.  Now (11) 
that MAKES (11) you a cheater.  

&#62; And also even if you are pkilled by cheaters, it is the same thing as 
&#62; you have been pkilled by legits.  No difference, result is that you 
&#62; die.  So don't blame cheaters, blame PKILLERS, Pkillers even include 
&#62; CHEATER-PKs.  So, if you've been pkilled, no pain, no gain.
&#62; 

And also, (12) even if you are pkilled by cheaters, it is the same 
thing as IF (13) you HAD (14) been pkilled by legits.  No difference, 
THE (15) result is that you die.  So don't blame cheaters, blame 
PKILLERS, Pkillers even include CHEATER-PKs.  So, if you've been 
pkilled, no pain, no gain.

&#62; WE CAN'T GO FIGHT THEM, HOW CAN WE FIGHT WHOM WE CAN'T HIT??

WE CAN'T GO FIGHT THEM, HOW CAN WE FIGHT those (16) WE CAN'T HIT??

&#62; FORGET ABOUT LEGITIZING THE CHEATERS!

FORGET ABOUT legitimizing (17) THE CHEATERS!

&#62; p.s.  LEGIT pkilling days has ended, accept your destiny, it was 
&#62; forseen.  

p.s.  LEGIT pkilling days HAVE (18) ended, accept your destiny, it 
was 
forseen.

Of course normally I wouldn't bother to help out, but I am concerned 
that in view of your current literacy skills, those of us with an IQ 
below 141 are going to feel even more worthless. I mean, if someone 
with an an IQ of 141 can be so dumb, what hope is there for me? 

Of course good English doesn't equate with intelligence, but don't 
worry, you strike out on both counts.

Have a nice day...Peter the Pedant</pre>
