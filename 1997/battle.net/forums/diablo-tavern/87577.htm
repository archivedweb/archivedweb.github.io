Heyas all,

Personally, I have no problem with Death and the Aces. Tarot is not a 
PK guild, but it can be quite fun to compete with other players on 
occasion, and many members do enjoy duelling. As long as the bounty 
hunters stick to duelling and/or hunting in the spirit of fun, I 
think the positions should be kept as they are. I don't see PKing as 
absolute evil or anything, as some really rabid anti-PKs in the guild 
have...to me it's just another way of playing the game. Besides, I've 
known many sorcerors with such bad aim that they may as well be PKs! 
I was recently accidentally PKed and MKed by a guild member (don't 
worry, I won't mention who it was, *cough*Pluto*cough*)

Cuda, welcome to the guild! I guess that pretty much sums up what I 
think about this situation... Although if we ever co-op together, 
you'll understand if I prefer you to go first? ;)

And finally, one note about the Tarot positions... Too many did seem 
concerned with PKing, and so a revised list was proposed by Zaradamus 
and circulated in the guild e-mail for a while. Unfortunately, I no 
longer have a copy of it, but the jobs seem to suit the positions 
better than the original, which is what is on the page now. Hmm, in 
this version, Star is supposed to be a &#34;Sorcerer that helps other 
Sorcerers defeat Diablo&#34;...I'm not quite certain that I fit the 
bill. Let's see, how about changing it to: &#34;A rogue who helps 
fallen friends recover their possessions?&#34; ;) (I seem to have 
been doing a lot of that lately). Well, just something to think 
about...
