<pre>Well, Wiseman started a string and i thought, &#34;hey, intellect on 
battle.net, who woulda thought&#34;.  So i didn't want it to fall off 
the edge of the page just yet.
Basically the jist of his post read along the lines of life.  Why are 
we here?  Can one man make a difference?  and other questions often 
asked in the privacy of your own mind (no not what toe jam tastes 
like, we're talking intelligent stuff).
Anyways, the string picked up a lot of decent replies from guys like 
Kiri-Joleith (hmm, wasn't that a good dragon from Dragon Lance...).

Anyways, i thought i'd throw in my own two cents on life and time.  
Mankind hasn't been around all that long, and in the grand scheme of 
things its obvious we don't mean much yet.  But to the planet Earth, 
well, we are a matter of life and death.
Thus far i'd say we are off to a good start.  In the history of 
humanity, now is the best time to live.  As it should be.  Its not 
like we are sitting around a camp fire marveling over some trinket of 
our fore-bearers too complex to even comprehend.  Nope, (except for 
that period after the collapse of the Roman empire) mankind has 
progressed and bettered itself.
People complain of the violence and lack of caring and the ignorance 
of the masses.  People look back and fondly recall the &#34;good 'ole 
days&#34; when things were so much better and simple (hmm, haven't 
seen much of that 'round Ogden's these days eh?).  Well let me paint 
a picture of the &#34;good 'ole days&#34;:

People say there was less violence.  Ok, so in the Roman era we had 
expansionistic campaigns (true, small armies, but ten thousand people 
back then was a lot) and slavery.  In the medieval era you had 
knights roaming the country side taking as they pleased.  You had a 
lot of law-less-ness, and for the comon man, might was right.  During 
the Industrial revolution you still had slavery, you had many poor 
people working in harsh conditions (and i do not mean harsh as in, 
&#34;oh damn, i got the night shift&#34;) and crime was rampant.  The 
start of the 1900's saw the two worst wars in history.  The 50's and 
60's were a time marked by cold war threats and harsh racism.  The 
70's saw flower love and Vietnam.  The 80's carried over the flower 
love thing and saw environmentalism spread, the woman's movement 
reach its peak (not in activity, but in actual rights granted).  The 
90's is a continuation of the 80's, but big is out and small is in.  
Everything is going compact and efficiency is key.  Where's the 
violence?  Well as a percentage of total population, it is the lowest 
by far in history.

Well i won't touch the ignorance part, cause 500 years ago it was 
comon knowledge that the world was flat.  100 years ago its resources 
where limitless, today it is a bubble in space.

Lack of caring?  400 years ago Europe invaded the rest of the world.  
200 years ago if you weren't white you were a slave, yesterday my 
family sent a check to Africa to feed a sponsor child.

My friends, the world is on the up and up.  Yeah its got its 
problems, but there is nothing broken.  People complain about the 
cars, but imagine if we all rode horse back?  The streets would be a 
metre deep in manure and a real challenge on a rainy day.  True 
technically the world should be entering another ice age, and it is 
green house gases that are keeping world temperatures from changing, 
but till things get out of hand, i am glad we've inadvertantly done 
something right.

While i've got lots more to say, this is getting rather long.  If 
you've read this far... you must be having a slow night, but thanks.

later.
