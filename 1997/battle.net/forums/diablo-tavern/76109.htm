<pre>  I didn't think you'd get so worked up over that, if i made you mad 
sorry. As for my inventory:

Godly helm of the whale:ac6 +193&#37;armor +93hp(i think)bought at 
wirt
Awsome full plate of the giants(ac70 +144&#37; armor +17 str)
WindForce(you know the stats,)  
or a strange bow of burning(4-8dmg +149&#37;dmg +1-16 fire arrows)
obs amulet of life(+28vit +37&#37;resis to all)
Gold ring of titans(+28&#37;to hit +26(i think) str)
obs ring of pre.(+34&#37;resis to all +20 dex

 All of these items are bought/found by me or traded with another 
member. And about the king's swords, i have a kings blade of haste, 
bought from wirt for 100k in a hell diff game:3-8dmg +80&#37;to hit 
+160&#37;dmg. Kai, you dont suck, you just don't have a high lvl 
rogue :).

&#62; i was only voicing my concern over these events..and my anger over 
&#62; seeing the items that some of my other clan members have.
&#62; 
&#62; i do not think one can find a godly helm of whale at level 39 in 
&#62; nightmare hell, or even on sale for that matter.i dont believe one 
&#62; can be so lucky as find ob zod rings (if anyone even HAS them..ive 
&#62; never seena  REAL one..must be a sight to behold!)
&#62; 
&#62; i KNOW snakegod doesnt cheat, but when you have 90 plus members, i 
&#62; mean, somewhere, there has to be a little slip up ..even if they dont 
&#62; realize they have duped items.ill admit, that before i joined 
&#62; snakegod, i had a duped royal circlet and ob amu of zod..but i dumped 
&#62; them (much to my disgrace) and obtained suitable replacements.
&#62; 
&#62; i just want to let the clan know that the post was only meant as an 
&#62; open question....the question being: are you sure you dont cheat?
&#62; 
&#62; i KNOW none of us use hack programs or editors,or what have you, but 
&#62; its very easy to pick an item up froma  friend who claims it to be 
&#62; real, and since you trust your friend, you keep it, not even thinking 
&#62; for a second that the kings sword of blood he gave you was 
&#62; duped....how come i NEVER found these items? i used to spend a little 
&#62; over an hour each day creating serial modem games and checking gris 
&#62; and wirt in hopes of finding half the stuff everyone else in my clan 
&#62; has.when i heard blackwind and gilgamesh bragging about their awesome 
&#62; weaponry one day last week, that was it, it made me sick to my 
&#62; stomach.i guess i really do suck..has anyone at all found the 
&#62; following, and if so, tell me how and where you found them:
&#62; 
&#62; any ob of zod jewelry
&#62; any godly plate
&#62; godly helm of whale
&#62; KSOH,KSOB,KSOV,KSOS
&#62; 
&#62; i've never seen themm....is it possible?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; to shaft and salmissra, and anyone else who was offended, look, we 
&#62; all have to examine oursleves and ask ourselves, are we 100&#37; sure 
&#62; we are clean? heck, not even me! i gained 5 experience levels (31-36) 
&#62; using an ob zod ring and a royal circlet until i chucked them.just 
&#62; dont let it worry you, if you dont cheat, then forget it.i just dont 
&#62; want any members using super powerful items and then dying and then 
&#62; people can see their stuff and wonder...how did he get that at level 
&#62; 32???  thats all..chill :-) i mean, i dont know any of the new 
&#62; members...so i cant say...either good or bad things, so i cant talk i 
&#62; guess.
