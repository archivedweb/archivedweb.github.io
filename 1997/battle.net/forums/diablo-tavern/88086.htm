&#62; 	Yes that is right.. my level 50 IS legit.. it didnt take long 
&#62; actually, I had my 3rd rogue which I used a lot more than this one at 
&#62; level 43 in 1.00 and this one at 49 in 1.02 when I retired it (I 
&#62; played a lot more back then) When I brought it back on bnet last 
&#62; month I was called a cheater because of the level and my acct.. well 
&#62; after 2 system crashes one which was because my system didnt like 
&#62; patch 1.03 the other I forget.. my acct is at about 569000 and its 
&#62; kinda hard not to call someone with a high acct a cheater if they 
&#62; have a high level.. I understand that.. but.. why does it 
&#62; automatically come up as &#34;they have a cheat site therefore they = 
&#62; cheater&#34;?
&#62; 	I dont use the hacks I make except to test them and it is ONLY on a 
&#62; test character that never comes on battle.net.  I am not stupid 
&#62; enough to hack my character then bring it on bnet :)  Anyway back to 
&#62; the subject... When you reach level 48 you are getting about 8 or 9k 
&#62; exp per kill in hell hell not just certain monsters at 49, a little 
&#62; more exp per kill, 50, you get 10k exp per kill.. thats ANY monster 
&#62; in hell hell.. dont believe that BS about you not getting exp because 
&#62; its just wrong.  I have played this game probably longer than anyone 
&#62; that is still on battle.net.. hell my first acct was 511 (damn crash 
&#62; make me MAD).
&#62; 	When you get to 50 you dont stop getting exp, you dont only get exp 
&#62; from some monsters, you dont go to the COW LEVEL, you just keep 
&#62; playing like normal.. granted you do see nicer things for sale but 
&#62; thats another story.  Howd I get that high in 1.02?  Well its called 
&#62; nothing else to do.. I was out of school and didnt have to do 
&#62; anything around the house so I came on bnet.. and since the game is 
&#62; so addicting, I ended up playing about 6 or more hours a day (usually 
&#62; 9 heheh).  And now that the game is BORING I have nothing else to do 
&#62; so I either find out new hacks or I edit my website ( 
&#62; <a href="http://evince.tierranet.com/soul/">http://evince.tierranet.com/soul/</a> ) or sit and eat :)
&#62; 	I am just tired of hearing the strange crap about level 50 and 
&#62; calling people cheats and such.. also YES BLIZZARD MADE THE GAME 
&#62; BUT... they dont play like some people do so they dont know EXACTLY 
&#62; how long it takes to get to 50.. they just guess.  ALSO, they say 
&#62; that you only get exp from some monsters.. well I havent seen any 
&#62; LEGIT level 50's saying they dont get exp for some monsters.. maybe 
&#62; blizzard means you dont get exp in normal or nightmare hell.. I dunno.
