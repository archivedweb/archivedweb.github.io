&#62; Well, I gained the last 40k of experience after fighting a few 
&#62; monsters in level 13 of Hell in Hell Mode, and I became Level 50.
&#62; 
&#62; First, the experience to get to the next level went &#34;none&#34; 
&#62; and I cannot gain experience on Level 13 anymore...level 14, though, 
&#62; I gained 10K experience per monster!  Doesn't help anymore, but it 
&#62; was fun.

&#62; My Stats are maxed, I have High Hp and High Mp for a warrior, my

&#62; Well, being level 50 is great.
&#62; 
&#62; It took me 6 months of back breaking level gaining, putting up with 
&#62; B.net down, occasionally losing my stuff, and in the long run, all 
&#62; that hard work paid off.
&#62; 
&#62; I am happy to be a legit Level 50....I may even try to get a rogue 
&#62; and a mage level 50...though that MAY take some time. :)
&#62; 
&#62; The Man
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Finding nothing lower than Blessed or Ruthless is great.&#34;
&#62; 
  
 
 Well Well Well, nice job TM. level 50, must be nice. i got one  
question though: how do you do it, how the HELL can u play the  
warrior class long enough to get to lvl 50, i gave up on mine at
 lvl 31. i couldn't take the no range aspect of the class. well i
 guess if your doing 500 damage it might be ok.
 thats a nice long list of good shit ya got there. if ya find anything
 really good that you can't use, just give it over here :)
 i think that you should go and make a mage and rogue. and do it all
 over again.

 well c ya on b.net TM  later
