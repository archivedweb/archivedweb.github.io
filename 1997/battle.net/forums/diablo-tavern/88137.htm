&#62; Most of you may recognise at least one of my names; Wiseman. Many of 
&#62; you, of course, may not. Of course, we can forget the name thing. It 
&#62; does not really matter who I am, or indeed who any of us are. Well, 
&#62; it seems that way. Just a warning - anyone who'll be offended if this 
&#62; post isn't really about Diablo better leave now.
&#62; 
&#62; Has anyone else ever looked around them while driving through town, 
&#62; and seen all the advertising that surrounds us? Has anyone ever 
&#62; thought about how much money is spent to ensure that we buy one brand 
&#62; of soft drink over another? And how comparitively little we spend on 
&#62; education, health care and social security? How much is spent 
&#62; researching better ways to kill ourselves?
&#62; 
&#62; Why are there great and powerful empires built around things that 
&#62; really dont matter? Has anyone looked at the number of cars passing 
&#62; on the street and thought about exactly how much of the worlds 
&#62; resources are being wasted on transport? And of course, the 
&#62; multinational corporations who strive to ensure that we continue to 
&#62; do so, because it is their income at stake?
&#62; 
&#62; Am I the only person out of all the people I know that worries about 
&#62; the world and the direction the human race is heading? How can I 
&#62; presume to say it? What gives me the right to speak?
&#62; 
&#62; I feel like I am standing at the bottom of an enormous hole, and Im 
&#62; being told that the sun is shining and its a wonderful day. I step 
&#62; back and take an objective look at the world, and see that we are 
&#62; going to hell. Mankind has ceased to care about each other, and 
&#62; ceased to care about our environment. We choose to escape from our 
&#62; responsibilities by watching television, or spending endless hours 
&#62; attempting to realign electrons in our character information files, 
&#62; trying to prove our worth by attaining something that does not really 
&#62; exist.
&#62; 
&#62; People who think like this can have all their problems solved, and it 
&#62; is so easy. You can go to someone, and they will tell you that you 
&#62; dont need to worry about it - that it isnt your problem. Get some 
&#62; rest, take two of these and call me in the morning. And thatll be 
&#62; fifty dollars please.
&#62; 
&#62; I have a question though. If it isnt our problem, then whose problem 
&#62; is it?
&#62; 
&#62; I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this world, 
&#62; you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way to this 
&#62; point. I suppose you are reading this because you logged on today, 
&#62; looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to have 
&#62; disappointed you.
&#62; 
&#62; You know what the funniest thing is? I am going to finish writing 
&#62; this message, and post it up here, and go home tonight, and waste 
&#62; another hour or two of my four score years on realigning electrons in 
&#62; my character file. Because while I may be concerned, society has 
&#62; taught me I can do nothing about it. Im only twenty, after all. And 
&#62; that makes me a hypocrite in your eyes, because I whine about a 
&#62; problem and then choose to ignore it - and so then, once I am safely 
&#62; classified in your mind as someone not to listen to, youll ignore it 
&#62; too, and scroll on to the next post. And well all be happy.
&#62; 
&#62; Just a thought. It wont actually achieve anything except to make me 
&#62; feel a little better, but I would appreciate it; if you read this 
&#62; entire message, and thought even for a moment about anything I have 
&#62; said - waste a post on replying. Lets see who cares.

Greetings, Wiseman.

OOC

In real life, I consider myself a bit of an optimist. Many of the 
things that go on in this world greatly sadden me, and I wish that I 
could change them, in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, such instantaneous 
changes are not possible. 

I find myself feeling more and more that it is up to all of us, as 
individuals, to do what we can to make the world a better place. 
Perhaps, through this mutual effort, we can make a difference. I see 
far too many people that blindly follow the &#34;norm&#34; in their 
thinking, and actions. I try not to let this get me down. It is hard, 
though, for me to accept the uncaring attitudes, and downright 
stupidity people some times exhibit. For example, the issue of race. 
Even thought this is a minor one, in the greater scheme of things 
that are wrong on our planet, it is one of the ones that I feel 
*must* be addressed first.

From the time I was little, I must admit, that I have never lived in 
a really racially diverse area. But, this aside, I cannot, at all, 
understand the anti-(insert race) attitudes of others who I meet, and 
work with. However, I see a light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps 
this is just me, but I seem to see more and more understanding in the 
people of my generation of others' differences. Without a feeling of 
unity, as the human race, and not as people of one &#34;color&#34; or 
another, we can't really move forward, as I see it...

Another issue is the environment. I have strong feelings about this 
subject as well. For far too long, man has raped the earth of its 
wealth. It sickens me to see the efforts of corporations to build-up 
more and more of the untouched lands that remain. It saddens me that 
humans place the almighty &#34;buck&#34; above all else, including 
his/her planet's environment. Sooner than most of us imagine, we will 
all have to deal with these issues. A breaking point *will* come, it 
is just a matter of time... But, I cannot lose all hope. I will make 
an effort, in my own life, to help end this terrible lack of caring 
about the isolated blue world we inhabit...

It isn't so hard to see why we haven't been visited by others yet, is 
it? They probably pity us, or despise our lack of caring, so they 
don't bother with us...

Sorry, I am kind of rambling on here, but I had to get my thoughts 
down...

I suppose that my name here, &#34;Truthseeker&#34; may fit me in real 
life as well. I seek to hold nothing against anyone else, save their 
words, and their deeds... 

&#34;If you must label me, call me a hopeless idealist.&#34;</pre>
