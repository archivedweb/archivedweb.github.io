<pre>Hi Folks...

  No it is not my intention to bore you with details of my weekend 
except to mention that I left Diablo behind for most of it.  In 
particular, I didn't come to the tavern to listen to tales or shoot 
the breeze.  So, after scrolling through the activities of the 
weekend, I find I would like to make some replies and comments [Gee, 
I'll bet that took everyone by surprise!] and to try and do this 
individually at two posts every two hours would take more time than I 
have, so I figured I'd lump them all together.  

  For anyone tired of my posts of appreciation to the storytellers 
and poets of Ogden's, now is the time to bail out... 

Rikor - I just couldn't keep up with ya!  From my perspective it was 
three chapters of &#34;Tales of the Wolf' and a song parody!   
Finally got to chapter 16 this morning, and enjoyed it a lot!  The 
truth of Justin seems to be on the horizon, and the dream 
foreshadowing promises excitement around the corner.  Thanks for 
continuing to share this tale with us!

Morteleux - The Return of Baltazar.... Wonderful perspective on the 
game, I'm looking forward to more of him, glad you picked him up and 
dusted him off!  And you continue to amaze and delight with the Cain 
an Adria epic poetry.  I could see the mad glint in old Leoric's 
eyes! Thank you as always for the effort and sharing your gift with 
words.

Delfontes..  Oh, Alright -=|)elfontes=-  hehe... Nice to see your
stories here again.  It was a bountiful weekend when my favorite 
authors leave presents behind.  I like the 'blast from the past' 
story, as well as the new one.  Exciting coop play is not a hard 
concept for a lot of us to understand.  Maybe sometime soon I'll be 
lucky enough to run into you in chat or a game.  You still have the 
tremendous talent of putting us in your place in your tales.  

Madelyn - I was very sorry to see your loss!  It was also very 
heartening to see the reaction from everyone.  Add me to the list of 
people who would like nothing better than to assist in your recovery. 
 Either by equipment, or participating in hell runs for new 
equipment.  We can start a 'Scour Hell for Mad' movement!  

  Well, that's it.  I hope I didn't omit someone I should have 
mentioned.  I will be pro-active, and offer the excuse of Monday 
morning with insufficient caffiene intake to be completely awake.
Yeah, I know its 10:30 and I've been at work for 4 hours... what's 
your point?  Hehe

Its Monday morning, and my barbaric quip engine is not running, so as 
a software engineer let me leave you with one of my favorite laws:

Weinberg's Law - If builders built buildings the way programmers 
wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would 
destroy civilization.

Now... on with the week!  Hehe!</pre>
