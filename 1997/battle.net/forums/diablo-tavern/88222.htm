&#62; Im not sure why but some pkers have an opinion of the game that i 
&#62; just can't see the sides of. Most say these things to justify their 
&#62; PKing:
&#62; 
&#62; a) It's just a game and nothing to worry about- This reason must have 
&#62; been made up by a brain dead pker. It does matter if u screw up a 
&#62; game when some friends are playing. How would u feel if you are 
&#62; having a great time in hell/hell going for your 3rd dot. You get down 
&#62; to level 16 and everything's dead, then everyone in your part dies. 
&#62; Then you have some prick ghost luaghing at you until you start a new 
&#62; game.
Did it ever occur to your feeble mind that not all PK's cheat?
&#62; b) It's a playing style- Blizzard created the player attack option 
&#62; FOR DUELS. Not to have a stupid 15 year old walking around screwing 
&#62; up every game they walk into.
Stupid 15 year old... now I'm pissed. I'm 14, A LOT more mature than 
you, and sadly, probably a lot smarter. If Blizzard intended it for 
duels, then why didn't they make PK GAMES instead? Btw: On NUMEROUS 
occasions Blizzard THEMSELVES have said that they put the PK button 
in for people to PK WITH.
&#62; 
&#62; The PKing population of Bnet makes me sick! At one time i could not 
&#62; enjoy 9/10 games because of PKers. You people are dying out, and will 
&#62; become no more. Once UO is up and going you people are screwed.
Well, it's a bummer your fun has been ruined, but for me, it was 
cheats that did it. I started PKing BECAUSE of cheaters. And the 
threat about us dying out? Gee you're dumb. PK in UO will be an 
option just like Diablo (I suppose...), for the same reasons it was 
put into Diablo. We will never die out, no sir, and why should we be 
so afraid of UO? OH, town guards... oooooo! OH, people ganging up on 
us... oooooo! We have surmounted greater problems in the past.

Funny you should choose an inhereintly &#34;evil&#34; name...
