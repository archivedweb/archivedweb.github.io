<pre>I appreciate your reply to my post. You have made an excellent 
&#34;followup&#34; reply to my original question and I enjoyed 
reading it very much.

I have been very much &#34;burned out&#34; by people who complain 
about cheating without fully thinking about what the alternative 
might have led to. Face it people, Diablo has open more doors and 
left more questions unanswered than most games ever have (with 
possible exception of DOOM). Blizzard did not intend to start this 
whole &#34;ethics&#34; question. They created a game, called it good 
and released it on the world. *NOBODY* had any idea of the problems 
what would come out of such a game.

As a Lead Game programmer, I can say that Diablo has caused more than 
a little &#34;dilema&#34; among developers. What will the next 
generation of Online games be like? How much freedom can the user be 
given control of? What is &#34;ethical&#34; in the fantasy world of a 
game? I cannot answer.... I don't know if there even is an answer.

Anyway more than anything, I wanted to to pose an intelligent (at 
least I hope it turned out that way) question, and welcome 
intelligent replies. You post did that and I thank you for it. My 
original post was cross posted to both Tavern and Stragety. 
Unfortunatly, over there it has turned into a &#34;is to&#34; &#34;is 
not&#34; argument (with a few acceptions).

&#62; Boy, go away for a week, and all Hell breaks loose . . . Inferno 
&#62; disintegrates, Blz_Bob actually joins a guild/clan/commune, and 
&#62; Ridcully's clones almost start a clan war!  Glad to see that the 
&#62; &#34;eternal&#34; topics of cheating and PKing are still around, 
&#62; otherwise this forum wouldn't feel like home.
&#62; 
&#62; CM, you have taken a very interesting approach by asking the 
&#62; question, &#34;What if cheating didn't exist?&#34;   I agree that the 
&#62; biggest effect would be the number and quality of items possessed by 
&#62; players, which would not have duped and hacked items available.  The 
&#62; critical question is how people would respond to the scarcity of good 
&#62; items.  
&#62; In general, I see two responses.  First, the person could just 
&#62; continue on with what they have, trade for, or find.  These people 
&#62; now are probably legit co-opers, and there would not be much 
&#62; difference in their pattern of play.  Unfortunately (from my point of 
&#62; view), these people seem to be in the minority.
&#62; 
&#62; The second response is to try to obtain items from other players by 
&#62; theft or MKing (assuming that you don't consider MKing to be a 
&#62; &#34;cheat&#34; that would be removed with the other cheats).  
&#62; Current PKers and MKers (both &#34;legits&#34; and 
&#62; &#34;cheaters&#34;) presumably all would fall into this group (the 
&#62; only difference between the current state of affairs and your 
&#62; hypothetical is that there is no legit/cheat distinction in the 
&#62; latter).  
&#62; 
&#62; This leaves the mass of cheaters of various types.  My guess is that 
&#62; since people who currently cheat have already demonstrated their 
&#62; willingness to &#34;cheat&#34; to gain high-end items, etc., that 
&#62; these same people also would be willing to go after other players to 
&#62; obtain high end items.  (A possible exception might be those who 
&#62; genuinely use the god-mode cheat or other cheats to protect 
&#62; themselves from PKers--these folks likely would retreat to private or 
&#62; clan games.)
&#62; 
&#62; PKing/MKing thus would become even more of a problem than it 
&#62; currently is in public games.  It seems likely that there are more 
&#62; non-PKing people playing in public games now than there would be if 
&#62; there were no cheats.  You allude to an interesting analogy between 
&#62; &#34;cheats&#34; and handguns--I can see your viewpoint of cheats as 
&#62; the &#34;great equalizer.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; I base this in part on my own reasons for playing in private games.  
&#62; I joined not so much to avoid cheats as to avoid other more obnoxious 
&#62; behavior by PKers and MKers.  Like you, I have played with people I 
&#62; later found out were &#34;cheats&#34; (dupers, actually), and as long 
&#62; as I didn't take any of their duped items, I had fun playing with 
&#62; them.
&#62; 
&#62; Just my initial reaction to your post.  I'll give it some more 
&#62; thought.
