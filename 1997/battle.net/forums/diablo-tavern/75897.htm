&#62; &#62; &#62; Inferno will never disappear, because there will always be somebody 
&#62; &#62; &#62; hoping to use the reputation (cough) to puff up their ego.  
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; BUT, due to the fact that &#34;There is no honor among thieves&#34;, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; you will see a constant turnover in the &#34;membership&#34; as the 
&#62; &#62; &#62; political backstabbing and BS goes on.  It is inevitable, just look 
&#62; &#62; &#62; at the history of the &#34;federation&#34;.  This group doesn't 
&#62; &#62; &#62; attract the type of person who wants to play nice with the other 
&#62; &#62; &#62; children, so of course they won't be able to get along for any 
&#62; &#62; &#62; extended period of time.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There ya go trying to play psychologist again...
&#62; 
&#62; Actually I have a degree in psychology, but you are right... I am 
&#62; just playing around with it here.  I love watching the interactions 
&#62; on this message board.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; I have been INFERNO for over 3 months. I have never had a personal
&#62; &#62; conflict with anyone in INFERNO. Sure, some people bug me, but thats 
&#62; &#62; no reason to start raising all hell and quitting. As far as the 
&#62; &#62; &#34;political backstabbing&#34;, in any group as large as INFERNO, 
&#62; &#62; there are always a number of people who want control. I personally 
&#62; &#62; dont, but I can understand the inclination. 
&#62; 
&#62; I totally agree, and you're taking some of my statements too 
&#62; personally.  I'm looking at this from a &#34;group dynamics&#34; 
&#62; standpoint, and just making observations.  
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; As for your initial comment about using INFERNO to puff my ego, the
&#62; &#62; same could be said about those who attack us. I personally am in
&#62; &#62; it for the fun, and fellowship. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Now, I admit that I was generalizing here... but you should admit 
&#62; that a lot (if not most) of the &#34;new&#34; Inferno members are not 
&#62; exactly elite Pkers.  They're coming in, or trying to join because 
&#62; they think Inferno is cool.  I'm not debating about whether Inferno 
&#62; is cool or not.. :)  I'm glad you enjoy the company you frequent.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; It must be very comfortable for you to just sit on the sidelines and 
&#62; &#62; judge everyone.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Silencer (INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Gee, I didn't realize I was judging anyone.  I'm just making 
&#62; observations and stating my humble opinions.  I regret that you are 
&#62; taking them as personal affronts.  Unfortunately, I enjoy observing 
&#62; you all too much to stop, so I'll try to be more careful not to 
&#62; bruise any Inferno egos in the future.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Kraaken (Sideliner)

Kraaken you wily 'ole shrink you...

OK, you got me. Maybe judging was the wrong word to use. And I dont 
really take your opinions personally, but Silencer does :)

Your opinions are valid, but the generalizations are what get me.
I could go into my long winded discussion on why I think that
psych's are nothing but good BS'ers, but we can take that off-line if 
you are so inclined. For now, I'll just stick to the task at hand.
Because we enjoy this game in a different way than you, you immediatly
cast us into one group of social misfits, and discard the fact that 
every one of us is an indidvidual. Our methods may be similar, but 
that does not mean our motives are. If you are looking at INFERNO 
from a &#34;group dynamics&#34; pespective, I (and Silencer) wish you 
would state that up front so there is no ambiguity as to about whom 
you are speaking.

Silencer (INFERNO)
&#34;... and How does having an arrow through your heart make you 
feel?&#34;</pre>
