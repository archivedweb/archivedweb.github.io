<pre>Yes, it's true, Tracy got my ear this afternoon. I was suspicious 
when she came in and wanted to know about joining Snakegod, but had 
an account number a third of mine. I whispered to Lord_Judicator 
about it for several minutes, but couldn't convince him. Finally I 
decided to find out one way or another the hard way. So I went to a 
game, tooled around in town for a while, finally went down. First set 
of baddies we meet, she uses chain lit, burns me a little. My 
suspicion grew. 

Unfortunately, I'm sad to say that my days in Snakegod have made me 
soft. I seem to have forgotten all of my pk-avoidence tactics which 
were brutally drummed into my skull in public games for months. 
Rushing into a pack of Balrogs is just fine when the person behind 
you is gonna start stoning them. Of course, if the person behind you 
wants to kill you, 'tis best to leave him between you and the 
monsters. Alas, I had forgotten this lesson it would seem, and just 
went for it. Big mistake. I still would've had him if it had been 
anything but Balrogs- their fire hid the fireballs that were hitting 
me. It took me a few seconds and two potions to realize that the 
Balrogs hadn't just stepped up their damage factor by tenfold. Alas, 
it was reaching for the teleport hotkey that was my doom- it took my 
fingers from the potion keys long enough for the fireballs to take 
their toll. Of course, with no suspicion left at all in my mind, I 
quickly restarted. Seems this was a wise move on my part. 

Tracy, while I won't thank you for killing me, it was exciting while 
it lasted. Take good care of my ear, it served me well, I'd hate to 
see anything happen to it. Oh, and Snakegods, her account number is 
#49849, so if you see someone with this number, you'd probably best 
not accept the offer to co-op.

As for me... maybe I need to spend more time in public games again to 
resharpen my skills. Time was when I killed three pks in a row after 
they tried to backstab me (course, I had two other people on my side 
two of those times =)).

And as for that cheating issue... I'm sure at worst it's highly 
exagerated, but rest assured that it will be looked into.
