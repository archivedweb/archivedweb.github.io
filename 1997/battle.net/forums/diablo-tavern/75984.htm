<pre>Yeah, our channel is like that. You see, immature little children, 
like yourself, like to do things to gain recognition. Taking over the 
Inferno channel is just one of these things. Once they've 
accomplished that, they like to brag about how they destroyed the 
mighty Inferno. We just sit back, yawn, and laugh at these losers. We 
start another channel and let the kids have their fun while we go 
about our business. And about this comment, &#34;Hugs and kisses 
inferno sissies&#34; well, keep in mind that this is the same person 
who used cheats and hacks when he dueled Eugene and Blz_Bobo. Look 
who is the sissy. 

                                                     Elijah

PS-It is I who will be looking for you. You see, I've already seen 
your new character and I'll will be looking for him everytime I log 
on. As you might have guess, I only post with the name Elijah. Who 
can you trust? Looking forward to mk'ing you. ;) 


&#62; Anyone check out their channel lately...??? It is inhabited by a 
&#62; bunch of non-inferno ascii phreaks, that is when I don't have the 
&#62; gavel....hehehehe
&#62; These retards can't even control their own channel. I love it!!!!
&#62; They make lame excuses why they can't duel, accept dumbasses like 
&#62; Anubisan and Sir Ving Thingy in their guild, and terroize newbies 
&#62; with their 48th lvl characters. Gee you just gotta respect them!!!
&#62; Oh for you inferno crybabies... I made a brand new character that has 
&#62; and will not use any cheats or hacks. I'll keep my other hacked 
&#62; characters, but this one will be just for collecting supposed non-
&#62; cheating inferno ears. His name is Ishap, of course.
&#62; And he'll be looking for you
&#62; 
&#62; Hugs and kisses inferno sissies
&#62; 
&#62; Ishap- The One Above All
