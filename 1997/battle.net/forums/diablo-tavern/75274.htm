<pre>You know what, I'm impressed. Bob you sound like a smart guy, and yet 
I can't believe you would stick up for inferno. But you deserve 
answers to your quetions, and you will get them.
Your first and second questions tie together. The Order IS an anti-
PKer guild. We do kill PKers. We do not kill newbies or anyone else 
who is not a PKer. In order for us to come after you, you must be a 
known PKer. We just don't go in unknown games and start hacking away. 
We are not Inferno. Maybe that makes us feel better about ourselves. 
It puts us above random, low, kill anything with my level 38 mage as 
long as it's under 5th level, typical Inferno member.
Your 3rd question deals with cheating. How do we decide if they 
cheat? Very simple. it is called Diablo Eye. If I join you in a game 
and I know you are a PKer so I scan you first. If you have cheats or 
hacks running, I will know and I or someone else will return with 
full cheats running and destroy you. If no cheats are running, I will 
challenge you, and hope you don't run for momma. We don't &#34;Put 
Godmode on and go in chopping&#34; What about Godmode? It is not a 
problem. Ask Pain how well his Godmode worked when I caught his 22 
level warrior with Godmode on Mking 2 level 5 characters. He'll never 
forget it... As for a description of cheating, hacks, cheats, item 
dupes, they are all cheats. 
Your 4th question deals with the Order's new members. Would you like 
to know who our new members are. They are people who want to sign on 
to BNET and have fun but can't because everytime they join a game 
some 20th level character with 2000 hit points comes in the game and 
PK's them. They join because they want revenge. Very few of us 
actually hunt PK's. Most join for protection.
They like knowing if they are PKed there is someone waiting in our 
channel to avenge them.
I will duel you anytime. Without cheating. I am not afraid to lose. 
It happens in a legit game. And I enjoy those legit games. Too often 
I have to hunt cheating PKers, and that is too easy. A legit opponent 
is a rarity on BNET.
And lastly I apologize about the name thing. I was tired and sick of 
reading those feeble attempts at replying from those inferno jokers.

I'll be looking for you...
