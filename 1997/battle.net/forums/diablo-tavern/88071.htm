&#62; Well, I never really got a chance to prove my own high opinion of 
&#62; myslef untill now(except for killing AI monsters).  I fought a level 
&#62; 35 (me a 31 then) sorceror and won twice.  I can't really commit a 
&#62; mindless pk but LEGIT DUELING ROCKS!!! And thats why I made this clan 
&#62; so that I can wage guild wars(not sensless anymore) and co-op (maybe 
&#62; keep the hopes of legits alive also). Later, because of my enjoyment 
&#62; of this duel I joined a game called &#34;DUEL LEGIT ONLY&#34; well as 
&#62; soon as I joined the guy who made the game left (I think his name was 
&#62; death something). Well another guy (warrior) was there at the time 
&#62; (SIR.EP or something like that). So being naturally self preserving I 
&#62; asked by the first guy left and later if the guy is legit (his answer 
&#62; was &#34;UMMMM&#34;) and whether he wants to duel (answer was yes). 
&#62; Well I ask him to take off any gnarled root rings and butcher cleaver 
&#62; rings and he supposedly does so (this guy has more then 700 health). 
&#62; So another mage joins (also prob not legit but I could be wrong, he 
&#62; had mana shield on so I couldn't tell godmode or not) and after a 
&#62; while another warrior joined.  So once I go down Sir Ep lets me put 
&#62; on mana shield and the duel begins eventually ending with me winning 
&#62; (the guy never came close to hitting me with his sword although he 
&#62; had all the spells like teleport). Then the other sorceror comes down 
&#62; (I think his name was NECROMANCER although it was in someway 
&#62; misspelled) and he joins in the fight too (he tells the warrior that 
&#62; he has 400 AC and thats why he can't even hit him even after he put 
&#62; his gnarled root and butcher rings back on).  I survive for a while 
&#62; almost dying a couple of times. While finally the last warrior comes 
&#62; down and I see that he has 2000 health points (Slash something was 
&#62; his name) and no mana shield (DUELS LEGIT ONLY still is the name of 
&#62; the game btw). So everyone seems to gang up on this guy and no one 
&#62; can hurt him (he also had all the spells). Eventually he casts a 
&#62; fireball that hits me  ( my mana shield being full and at about 580 
&#62; points) and kills me with one shot. I get ressed and then I continue 
&#62; the fight asking the guy to turn off his godmode and lower his spell 
&#62; levels he says nothing.  So onnce again I'm teleporting around like 
&#62; crazy doging fireballs when he teleports close to me and hits me 
&#62; while at the same time I teleport so I die a bit away from him. I get 
&#62; ressed by him and he proceedes to fireball me suprisinglyy doing no 
&#62; damage even with his sword (I'll have to investigate this further). 
&#62; So just my luck that a skeleton comes up and hits me once and bam all 
&#62; my stuff falls off on top of the gold that I droped previously (my 
&#62; obsidian gothic plate gets eaten, all my resistances gone).  I'm a 
&#62; bit sad, but suprisingly not angry (the guy taught me that I don't 
&#62; mind being killed by a cheater as much as I used to). I pick up all 
&#62; my rings and spkied club of the heavens and town portal out of there. 
&#62;  Which basically proves my point that ANY LEGIT(lv 30 and up) COULD 
&#62; KILL ANY CHEATER THAT HAS NO GODMODE ON. Face it we legits are just 
&#62; way better then dupers who just stand there and click (even the mages 
&#62; and rogues have KSOH). This seems to make my clan a little bit more 
&#62; powerfull (it being a pk and duper hunter thing) in the final war 
&#62; between cheaters and legits. 
&#62; 
&#62; Come on godmoders turn the damned thing off. What fun is it when your 
&#62; opponent dies with one hit? Geez you are so powerfull that we don't 
&#62; even want to play with you...

I agree completely w/ f.o.r. 
godmoders are weak. </pre>
