<pre>      HI folks,
  Well, yes I did finally log onto UO last night just for a little 
while before I went to sleep. Well, first off to all those folks who 
complain....&#34;the graphics look like nintendo&#34;...not 
true...They don't look as rich as Diablo, but I don't play RPG's for 
graphics, I play them for the gaming.
  We'll I used one of the preset character type. I chose animal 
trainer.This simple auto adjust your three stats Strenth, Dex, and 
Int and auto picks your three skills. You can alter them but I just 
wanted in. Well I selected a male character, with long black hair and 
a goatee and set the skin color to the whitest possible. GOTHIC MAN! 
Yes,the paper doll kinda looked like Trent Reznor if he had 
muscles..ehhhe...Picked Vesper to start in...click....WELCOME To 
ULTIMA ONLINE...woohoo..
  Well, now my character icon didn't turn out exactly the way I 
planned. I looked like some vagabond hippie with a shepherd staff.
Oh, well so I went walking around trying to figure out how to use the 
interface. After months of left clicking to move...errr..UO would 
have to be right click to move...errrr...oh well I will get used to 
it..
  Well I decided to take a walk out of town. AHHH....the beauty of 
the wilderness...the peace of the the trees....the people lying in 
wait to kill me....!!!!...yup....no sooner I got out of town...some 
guy with a 
sword and shield tried to kill me. Now I have no problem with this I 
was being a dumb newbie. So what did I do in the face of having to 
fight off some armored guy with a shepherds staff and having no 
fighting skills? Well, I RAN LIKE A LITTLE GIRL...eheheh...yup right 
back to town. Now this would-be-pk followed and still tried to kill 
me....this is when I got to see the guard in action. AHAHAHAHA..chop 
chop chop..dead player. Well, I was going to try to take his stuff, 
but I got lagged off the server.
   I got back on for one more try. I walked farther north and found a 
graveyard. COOL! So ehhh why not I will go inside...errrr...mistake..
..SHADES...when you have no fighting exp at all or even a weapon of 
any sort these guys are bad news. Well, a few moments later I was 
dead. A ghost and the world turned grey. Well, I figured this would 
be a good way to explore and I did. I walked about 10 seconds more 
north and what do I find!? A LLAMA! ....errrr...but I was dead no 
chance to try and train it and name it ROXY...oh well...I saw some 
neat things.
A bear and some giant thing were fighting that was especially neat.
   Well, I logged off and made a new character and logged back on, 
since I could not find anywhere to get res'd. I wandered some more, 
and got killed by a giant thing. Squash! err....and wouldn't you know 
it..as a ghost...I found another LLAMA..errrr...
   Well, that's all that happened for me! Many days more to explore 
the world of UO. It should be fun.
