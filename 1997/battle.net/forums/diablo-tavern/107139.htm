&#62; Ok, 
&#62; I was just wondering how many people actually still play diablo, I 
&#62; dont, but that is because well, I have no cd.  But what I want to see 
&#62; is how many people actually play diablo, how long they have been 
&#62; playing, their character names, classes,  and levels, and why they 
&#62; still play.  I would be playing if I had my cd :)
&#62; 
&#62; Here is my info to start...
&#62; I have been playing Diablo since Beta, my first BNET acct was 511, my 
&#62; character names were Can'tLevelUp!  R(45), FuknFUN!!! R(45), -
&#62; =SoulInferno=- R(50).  I would still play because I love playing with 
&#62; my fellow Snakegod members because they are always there when you 
&#62; need them, they are always helpful, and they are just a cool bunch, 
&#62; even if I didnt play, I would still come on bnet to chat with them.
&#62; 
&#62; Format for above.. Charactername CLASS(level)  IE.. Can'tLevelUp! was 
&#62; a level 45 Rogue
&#62; 
&#62; CLU

k.....my bnet account has jumped all over the place.....after 
numerous crashes and system formats....my present one is i believe 
around the 935,000's.....i dont' remember the exact number (cuz i 
haven't had a need to =])

my characters:

MoonLightKnight (warrior, level 40): my highest character....got 
fucked up by some lameass hacker that totally fucked up my stats 
:(... i'm still trying to find a cure (if there is any)....kattClawer 
gave me one but it's way too slow to use

Angelleah (rogue, level 28): probably my suckiest character, i hate 
rogues....but it's probably my best pking character, and worst co-op 
character (has pathetic to hit, and not much great stuff, except for 
a windforce)

MDK (mage, level 32): the character i probably use the most now, i 
often take him out to the public games and piss off cheaters and 
dupers and the like....heh....have only found 1 legit player with 
this guy on open bnet (MLK: 10, AL: 7)....

MoonDarkKnight (warrior, level 11); quite possibly the most stacked 
newbie character i've ever created....gave him a mail of harmony, 
obsidian ring, amulet of the zodiac, shield of blocking, Strange 
blade of the heavens (thanks to jyno for this one)....and to back him 
up.... a kings axe of haste....oh baby this guy  rocks and can whizz 
through the church and early cats like it was nothing....newbie 
dupers and cheaters beware...he's a force....

I still play diablo for the following reasons:

1.  wanna try to get my mage to complete hell/hell by himself (kinda 
aways off....but oh well)

2. wanna get (if he gets fixed) MLK up to the 40 kills range....(he's 
at 35 kills now)

3.  just love to piss off those newbie dupers and cheaters who say 
&#34;well this plate was given to me, so i dont' need to cheat&#34; 
hahaha

4.  always fun to kill diablo, recently just started timing myself 
see how fast i can get past it.....heh......haven't broken 2 
hours....probably never will....

there's my reasons......hope you get back on CLU ..... we miss ya :)

MLK</pre>
