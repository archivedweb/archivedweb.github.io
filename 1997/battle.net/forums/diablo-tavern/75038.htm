<blockquote>
<pre>Ok, today was a great day.  As some of you may remember, a little 
while ago I talked about killing some of these lil coop wimps.  Well, 
today, in less than a hour, I pked   not one, not two, but THREE 
SNAKEGODS.  The Snakegod Ears I obtained are:

Shaft6.
Lord_Judicator
AND

Lepthana.

Ok, this is how I did it, and I admit today I was very evil indeed.

I go into Snakegod channel as my mage where I see Shaft6.  I ask him 
how I can join snakegod, and we talk a bit.  I then ask him for help 
getting some new equipment.  He agrees and so we go into a private 
game.  We go down, and right off the bat he gets killed by lightning 
throwers, with a little help of a fireball.  BAM, MKED, he drops all 
his stuff and what do ya know:

&#34;A DUPLICATE ITEM HAS BEEN DETECTED, DESTROYING DUPLICATE.&#34;

Obsid zod rings.  He also had obsid zod amulet and Holy Helm of 
Whale.  So, he Quits the game.. I am like hmm, i wonder if he timed?  
SO  I pick up all his stuff and he comes back.  He tells me he used 
his backup program.  Interesting I think.  I always considered this 
cheating, but from someone who had dupes, it no surprise.  So, he 
comes down, and I blast him right away and collect his ear.  He quits 
again and comes back.

Shaft: &#34;You killed me on purpose!!&#34;

Me: &#34;Oh crap.  I thought you were monster.&#34;

Shaft: &#34;I am not a monster!!&#34;

Me: &#34;Sorry, I saw movement and fired, when I saw it was you it 
was too late.&#34;

Shaft: &#34;It is ok.&#34;

Me: &#34;Sorry again&#34;

So, we go back to chat and Lord is there.  Together I agree to help 
them get their dots.  So we go down and when the time arrises, I kill 
Lord &#34;accidentally&#34; with chain Lightning.  Bingo, another 
ear.  However, I need to keep the &#34;game&#34; going.  I am still 
planning to kill more,  and I can't blow my cover.  So, I help them 
get their dot, and then we go back to chat.

Now, all this planning is worthwhile.  Lepthana is in chat.  So I 
start my smooth talking.  &#34;Hi how can I join.&#34;  Finally I go 
into &#34;can you help me get some stuff?&#34;  Well, Lepthana agrees 
and so we go into a  game.  It isn't long that I find the perfect 
opportunity. Lepthana gets surrounded by Balrogs.  Immune fire.  I 
begin blasting with Fireballs.  AHHHHHHHH she dies.  I have res hot 
keyed so I quick cast it.  SHe is fast though and restarts, a second 
away from getting Mked.  Good move Lep, but it was still satisfying 
pking you.


Well, THREE SNAKEDOGS DOWN.  More to come.
