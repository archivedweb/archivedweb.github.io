<pre>I really hate to see folks trying to turn UO into a massively multi-
player virtual frag-fest. This mentality seems to have permeated 
entirely too deeply into online gaming for my taste.

Diablo != Quake
UO     != Doom

I just wish there were a decent way to segregate players so that 
these guys could have at each other without blowing the fun for the 
rest of us. This is one of the many reasons I am not interested in 
the least in UO, despite the positive reviews given it by many 
friends. Role-playing an evil character, my ass! Heh!

Regards,

ZelRiptha

p.s. Looking forward to Baldur's Gate...

&#62; Just what the subject says ... I expected some reaction, but didnt 
&#62; realize it would be so upsetting to so many people. I felt the 
&#62; general slant of the post mirrored what I had seen in UO so far. I 
&#62; have never seen a single highway bandit type role-play killer, just 
&#62; bands occasionally at crossroads yelling and laughing and killing 
&#62; anything that moved. I guess I simply dont understand the motivation 
&#62; behind , or &#34;fun factor&#34; in that. I also dont understand 
&#62; references (in a post below) to how people can say one player is 
&#62; &#34;better&#34; then another in UO. Is a high profile warrior a 
&#62; &#34;better&#34; player then an animal trainer living alone in the 
&#62; wilderness? Put another way, if a role-playing warrior-murderer kills 
&#62; the role-playing animal trainer, is the murderer a better player? I 
&#62; dont see any connection or relevance in that way of thinking, and 
&#62; having fun playing a game like UO. 
&#62; 
&#62; Statistics are funny things and highly prone to error and subjective 
&#62; interpretation. I highly doubt that survey was conducted with very 
&#62; much control or scientific method. Foxgloves survey of Snakegod 
&#62; members was much better  and much funnier. And no, it wasnt a slam 
&#62; to PoC. I only know one (barely) member of PoC. I understand there is 
&#62; bad blood between PoC and Snakegod  oh well, well have to let those 
&#62; chips fall where they may. And no, the post wasnt meant to be a slam 
&#62; on teenagers. I spent most of my Diablo time playing IPX with my two 
&#62; teenage sons who I respect very much. I also share computer time in 
&#62; UO with one of my teenage sons and I see he handles himself very well 
&#62; in that virtual world. 
&#62; 
&#62; How do I treat a killer in UO attacking me? I treat them as I do any 
&#62; other monster  fight back or flee, whatever the circumstance 
&#62; dictates. Ive been dispatched before by a killer in UO and I wasnt 
&#62; any &#34;deader&#34; then if I had been nailed by a Troll. 
&#62; 
&#62; Long and windy, Ill not post on this subject again.
&#62; 
&#62; Take care, respect the other players, and have fun! 
&#62; Serina (Snakegod)
&#62; 
&#62; PS If ya have to be a killer, please have a little style  any of you 
&#62; remember Rev. Lovejoy?
