<pre>I dunno... I myself never found GPOW, so I may be mistaken, but... 
there are some of my observations:
I never FOUND in labirinth anything with suffix or prefix which Adria 
or Griswold do not sell on daily bases! One possible exception could 
be an Emerald shields bows or anything, which are not handld by 
Grizwold, but Adria sells them! I found lots of Massive and even 
Savage swords and bows, I found lots of Kings swords and Hammers with 
Flails, god, I even found several King's staffs which are pretty rare 
to come by, but I never and I mean NEVER found single wierd or 
Ruthless or Merciless piece of equipment! Same with Mammoth's and 
Whales. I mean well we all hate when we find like Kings dagger of 
bashing.. it's pretty useless, or for example Awesome rags of Stars, 
but WHY I NEVER FOUND GODLY RAGS? I mean I wouldn't need them anyway! 
Or about Holy rags... I saw even several Holy plates at wirt.... BUT 
never at Griswold! Well King's things are CERTAINLY better then 
Wierd, why I never found ANY Wierd anyhing? Best to hit bonus I 
personally found was Metheoric... and YES Grizwold sells metheoric! 
It does bugs me when people keep telling about how they FOUND GPOW 
and I personally NEWER found a single Godly rags! I would ask people 
take a screenshot while ID'ing their next LEGITLY found GPOW or 
anything with NONAdria or NONGriswold suffix prefix. Now about King's 
bow. It doesn't exist. My arguments? Well here u go: If it existed it 
would be sold by wirt, let's suppose it's just REALLY rare! and I 
mean REALLY.. so shouldn't there be at least Lord's bow? Or champions 
bow? As soon as I see wirt offering me a Masters bow of anything in 
form of short bow I will believe in King's bow... sorry for now. Same 
way there is NO Mersiless bow of Perfection. Wirt doesn't handle 
Perfection suffix... so max u can get is heavens! So I think that 
such suffixes and prefixes as:
Mersiless
Ruthless
Godly
Holy
Mammoth
Whale
Wierd
Strange
Thunder
Burning
Slaughter(?)
can be obtained ONLY from wirt. They cannot be found in the game! 
That's my personal belief. Cmon! If they did exist in labirinth your 
inventory would be full of Godly rags of nothing after each Lasarus 
run, and cheaters would be duping Mersiless bow of Perfection like 
crasy! I am not also sure about where GPOW and rest of this crap 
coming from, but I think it has to do with SINGLE player game! I 
think that Pricing policy in Single player should be DIFFERENT! (U 
can guess I never played Single player) So GPOW would actually cost 
MUCH less there! Let's imagine then that YOU made Unlimited money 
hack in Single player mode.. now all YOU have to do is go to wirt and 
BUY item each time! So u will have NEW Item EACH time! Why I came to 
this conclusion? SIMPLE! There are Godly plates of the Whales and 
Holy Plates of the Mammoth, same with Osmosis... BUT DID ANYBODY EVER 
SEEN GODLY PLATE of Sorcery? Or Godly Plate of Gigants?  NO? WHY? I 
found MUCH more items with such sufixes then I found anything of 
mammoth( I NEVER found Mammoth's items) So I think we are DONE with 
&#34;I FOUND my GPOW&#34; thing.. it cannot be FOUND! Now, about 
Wirt's pricing policy. I never actually bothered to check, but I 
never seen Wirt selling items CHEAPER then Griswold. I sure that at 
beginning everything at Wirt was more Expensive, but 1/3 discount bug 
discovered I believe by McVay worked. Now after Second patch I think 
bug was REMOVED same with Repeated inventory at wirt(or was it patch 
2?) Yes, before if you buy something from Wirt and then log back in, 
you would be offered SAME exactly item! Same with Elixirs... That's 
HOW me and Set got our mages Maxed on Magic and strenght around 
levels 29-30.... I do not believe in Maxed stats before level 35. 
well may be 34.... NO way u can max yourself at 31!!!! Don't feed me 
with BS! I have 7 characters after two computer crashes.. I think I 
know when U can Max your stats LEGIT way(Btw... I helped Tracy to 
boost her Little rogues stats by bying Elixirs, I handled to her like 
20 elixirs and Tracy been making Laz runs and keeping potions for 
Little rogue too... I believe level 25 rogue is still 100 short from 
maxing Dexterity.... Ya! With 4 characters Bying Elixirs and Giving 
them to rogue she is 100 SHORT! So shuddup &#34;I bought elixirs with 
my high level char and then transferred them to this char.&#34; 
whiners.. it's sorry excuse for duping elixirs! Anyway... I still 
await pic of IDENTIFIED Godly ANYTHING shot at KAIN... Ya U can get a 
proof of not only BUYING items but also of Identyfying them! Har har 
har har har...... and I still would love to see Godly Plate of 
Sorcery! Or Godly mail of Sorcery or Godly rags of Sorcery!</pre>
