<blockquote>
<pre>If you feel my talking to people about our items constitutes 
&#34;boasting&#34;, I can't do much about that.  But if you think my 
items are so much better than yours ( I don't know why since you have 
way more HP and the same AC), here's how I got mine.

1.  Play a lot of games, and always in the hell levels.  And play 
normal difficulty even though it gives you zero exp.  Why?  You can 
go all the way through much more quickly, and therefore more times 
than if you play NM of hell diff.  More time through means more 
items, which means more chances to find good ones.

What are the best things have I found?  Royal Circlet (actually, I 
traded mine with Spellstormer who gave me one with 140 dur.); Obs 
ring of the stars, obs ring of the heavens, obs amulet of the zodiac, 
two dragon's rings of harmony with different stats, obs. ring or 
amulet of wiz (I forget which because I gave it to one of my 
secondary characters); about four plain obs rings or amulets; about 
four plain zods; king's blade of haste (3-8 version; I picked it up 
in Laz' room after all of us in the game had walked past it two or 
three times because it was &#34;only&#34; a blade); Dreamflange, a 
couple of plain king's swords, Gotterdamerung (not ID'd).

2.  Shop.  Start new games just to see what's for sale.  It's boring, 
but if you're crazy enough start enough games - I've started hundreds 
in a single day, and seldom if ever start fewer than a dozen - you'll 
eventually be offered some very good things.

The best I've been offered?  Various king's swords including haste 
(long sword version); various other king's weapons including haste; 
Godly great helm of the whale, godly crown of the whale, and awesome 
crown of the whale (which I traded to you for a crown with lower AC 
and lower HP !!!), probably a dozen assorted strange swords, probably 
a dozen assorted strange bows; eight Awesome full plates that I 
counted, but never one with a suffix; various Godly, holy and Awesome 
shields with total AC as high as 50+, and with various suffixes.

Now this sounds like a lot, but it includes items I was unable or 
chose not to buy.  And it is also the result of THOUSANDS of games 
that lasted only a minute or so; i.e. just long enough to check Gris 
and Wirt's offerings.  Hundreds of games might easily not be enough.  
You can go hundreds of games in a row without seeing a great item.  I 
know; I've done it.

So there it is.  My secret revealed.  Big deal.  Overall, your 
equipment is at least as good as mine.  But if you need better, all 
it takes is being crazy enough to play all those normal/hell games 
and to start all those games just to shop.  AFTER you've done that, 
if it still hasn't helped you, then come see me again.  I'll gladly 
give you a shoulder to cry on.
