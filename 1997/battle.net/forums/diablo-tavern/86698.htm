<pre>Ya I may be wrong about Masters bow... but I don't remember anything 
better then Warriors... anyway.. Emerald items ARE findable! I found 
several Emerald shields and couple of Emerald bows by myself! I also 
SEEMED to remeber having a Platinum or even Mithril ring LOONG time 
ago... not sure if I remeber correctly.. most probably I am wrong.. 
anyway, I strongly believe that Ring of Stars in ver. 1 was up to 15! 
YES! I do remeber it! I found my ring of Stars on Normal hell and it 
was +15 to all! I think Everybody remebers his FIRST cool ring... I 
doubt U ever FOUND Godly Cloak.. see godly is from same range with 
Kings... I find king's iems almost each Laz run! Damn! I even found 
Great King's axe of Bashing recently! 12-30 +100 to hit +158 damage.. 
so? I never seen any damn Godly robe from ANYBODY! Well I don't 
usually ID every robe I find, but I do ID most of helms caps and 
Shields! And compare to Ided swords and persentage of IDed King's 
swores... well anyway... if U find another Holly molly or Godly 
shmodly armor take a pic while Iding it... Grrr... I pretty much 
think BLZ tech dupport guys are full of shit.... see.. U ask them 
question and their answers are kinda: Keep looking guys! Emerald 
Jewelry? WTF? Who ever SEEN ANY single EMERALD ring of ANYTHING? NO 
one! Who ever found PLAIN emerald ring? And BLizzard tech support 
responded to guy kinda: Keep looking! I seen McVay's question to 
Blizzard about Godly plate of ANYTHING... he gave them calculations 
of odds him finding a godly plate... well.... u can guess what they 
answered.. keep looking on deeper levels of dungeon... BTW... one 
more thing about Wirt: HE NEVER offered me ANYTHING for more then 
140000! NEVER!!!! He keeps his prices under 140000 so does Grizwold! 
So there is NO actual way of getting Godly plate of Osmosis from 
anybody or anywhere! See I think most of Legit players were 
CONSTANTLY BShitted by cheaters or half cheaters.. U know.. this lill 
&#34;hey I found this! Honest!&#34; Only thing I can say they 
probably TOO addicted to their hacks and dupes to dump them! Yes, I 
remeber od times when GPOWs and GPOAs just appeared! It was all of a 
sudden! Just after Enigma's trainer allowed gold cheat! Damn! Since 
then GPOW's and GPOA's started popping as mushrooms! Then there was a 
quiet period during which everyone had SAME Godly plates... Let me 
remind most popular plates in OLD ages:
GPOA
Godly plate of the Mammoth
Holy Plate of the mammoth
Godly plate of the Whale
Godly plate of Osmosis
I seen most of them! I been when they first appeared.... Now there 
are like 6 variants of GPOW.... I still think all Godly plates and 
such came from Single player! Cmon! It's believable! Look.... U make 
level 99 character in Single player(so Wirt sells u GOOD stuff), and 
Unlimited gold, then u just go back and forth buying items and 
dropping them on ground! If anybody who played Single player can 
enlighten me about pricing policy there, we can Clarify this 
thing(from what I know Pricing policy should be VERY diferent) Then u 
Use Hex to track down code which is very easy... U need just make a 
copy of character's file before u buy plate and then compare two 
files... so U know how's Plate looks, then U just copy sequence and 
replace several numbers in Multyplayer..(I have NO idea how item 
encoding works in Diablo, but That's EXACTLY what I would do or try 
to do if I wanted to hack Diablo by myself...) That might explain 
Durability and charges hack.. it's certainly coded in game engine to 
recognise CERTAIN items with FIXED stats, so U cannot have Broad 
sword with 30-50 basic damage.. however Durability and Staff charges 
are variable(not only by shrines, but also by repair and by 
recharging staves by your warrior or sorcerer) So u just copy file 
with your character, then cast several apocs in EMPTY place and then 
compare two files... U figure which number is responsible for charges 
and change it to 255... I think there should be two numbers tho... 
one responsible for MAX charges and one for current charges, so U may 
want to recharge stave to figure where BOTH numbers are.. NOTE I 
never DID this thing and NOT intended to do! I think cheating kills 
fun in game ... it's only a game right? But I had little hacking 
expirience in Russia and I have couple of Professional Hacker friends 
there with who I hanged around...(I never understood what they were 
talking about anyway.. )And that's pretty much HOW I would start to 
hack a game like Diablo.... I would suggest next time Blizzard make a 
jumping code for saved characters! I seen one game protected this 
way.. and ONLY VERY good hacker can actually HACK this game and 
what's MOST important it cannot be MASS thing... see this way U 
encript character's stats using a key word, so let's say u use a 
random keyword from 5-8 letters from characters name 5-8 is because U 
use different number of letters every time! Well program which was 
encripted this way was hacked in Russia by several programmers...and 
it wasn't GAME... so they actually worked for money.. I would love to 
see any of MODERN hackers who hack diablo to deal with this 
thing...for free.. I also suggest compressing saved file, so 
comparing will give nothing... now THAT would be a TASK! a challenge 
for a hacker! Ya.. there are MANY ways to keep game cheat free even 
with character saved on users HD... question if U want to make it 
cheat free... or if U want to collect money and forget about it!</pre>
