&#62; &#62; What do you mean &#34;GET&#34;? He found the items, just like you 
&#62; &#62; would find most of the items you are telling him to get. 
&#62;  Yeah, i found my items, but he didnt...he said, &#34;WHERE IS THE 
&#62; BEST PLACE TO FIND exc...&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62;  Anyways, he 
&#62; &#62; sounds like a new player (sorry you couldn't pick that up) and he 
&#62; &#62; needed questions to be answered.  To those who live on Godly items, 
&#62; &#62; YES, those items suck.  But to legit people, those are some of the 
&#62; &#62; best.. people don't even realize it.
&#62; 
&#62;  I can tell hes probably a newbie..most newbies think those are the 
&#62; best items, but if you use those yer gonna get killed by fallen ones. 
&#62; I was telling him what to look 4, and if you try, you will find those 
&#62; items or better. Ske, they might be good..but a saintly gothic plate 
&#62; is better that the demonspike coat, and the grandfather is nothing 
&#62; more that a Soldiers great sword of the heavens, not very good. And 
&#62; about the gpow exc, if i used that crap why would i tell him to get a 
&#62; saintly plate? I'd tell him to get a gpow!
&#62; 
&#62; katt
&#62; &#34;So what if it's 2:00am? i'm not tire.......*falls over*&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Ske
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ps. you say to legit people they are great items. I am a legit 
&#62; person, no hacks/dupes, and ask almost anyone, those items are ok for 
&#62; normal diff but nightmare and up, with those yer a dead fish.
&#62; 
&#62; Pps.it's late if i mistook yer post sorry...*falls over again*

Heh.. Yeah, I know you can find MUCH better (As I have too). I was 
just informing this 'sir' that what he did find was probably good for 
his level.  You were right to let him know to keep looking, but for 
now I would definately use what he's wearing (not ME, but, if I was 
in his shoes, so to speak).  Anyways, good luck in gaming.</pre>
