<pre>I gave up on expecting to play a coop game along time ago. I can 
usually tell if someone is a pk in the first few minutes of play. If 
they are not a Pk, then it's coop time! Now I just wait for the 
idiots to come into the game. &#34;where r u&#34; &#34;send 
portal&#34; is music to my ears cause I just love to screw up their 
game, just like they love to screw up other games. Nothing is more 
frustrating to a pk than to spend 1/2 an hour in a game and not get 
an ear, cash, or other goodies. The upside to this is if they are in 
my game, they can't be screwing up other games. So come on in, the 
waters fine! And if they finally realize that it doesn't pay to get 
into my games, then thats more coop games and solo runs for me!! Oh 
God this is great! 

Just to let you pk'ing idiots know, If you come into my game and I 
send you a portal... hee hee I'm on level 16!!! bwahahaha.

           &#34;With my Two-ears I can hear you coming a mile away. 
but it was a nice try anyway!&#34; :-)

&#62; Im not sure why but some pkers have an opinion of the game that i 
&#62; just can't see the sides of. Most say these things to justify their 
&#62; PKing:
&#62; 
&#62; a) It's just a game and nothing to worry about- This reason must have 
&#62; been made up by a brain dead pker. It does matter if u screw up a 
&#62; game when some friends are playing. How would u feel if you are 
&#62; having a great time in hell/hell going for your 3rd dot. You get down 
&#62; to level 16 and everything's dead, then everyone in your part dies. 
&#62; Then you have some prick ghost luaghing at you until you start a new 
&#62; game.
&#62; 
&#62; b) It's a playing style- Blizzard created the player attack option 
&#62; FOR DUELS. Not to have a stupid 15 year old walking around screwing 
&#62; up every game they walk into.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; The PKing population of Bnet makes me sick! At one time i could not 
&#62; enjoy 9/10 games because of PKers. You people are dying out, and will 
&#62; become no more. Once UO is up and going you people are screwed.
