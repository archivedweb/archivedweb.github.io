<pre>One more thing...this wasn't a question on the survey, but I wanted 
to bring it up...
  If you ever enter a room on bnet and (as is often the case) there 
are identified items lying in town, u should NEVER take them for 
yourself, even if they &#34;appear&#34; to be legit. The fact is that 
you do not know whether they are dupes or not, although often the 
precise items that lie about will give you a good idea if they are 
likely to be. Unless someone you really know is in the room and can 
tell you that they personally found/bought an item sitting in town(or 
dungeon for that matter, if we're talking about identified items)then 
you shouldn't take...you shouldn't take someone's word for it 
either..there are people who will say that they &#34;found&#34; an 
item, when they really &#34;found&#34; the item in the same way that 
I am currently describing..others may outright lie about an item's 
origins, for whatever reason..  The bottom line is that for the most 
part, you ought to find or buy items for yourself..that is the legacy 
of the duping bug.
    About MKing...it has come to my attention that if your computer 
is not fast enough, for some people avoiding an MK can be truly 
impossible, unless they simply never go down stairs in bnet. This is 
because for some people, their computer lag is great enough that they 
die before having any chance whatsoever to take any action at all, 
whether that be teleporting, casting mana shield or escaping the 
game; they die before any action is possible. Now, a person can 
decide to never take anothers portal, but if you want to play on 
bnet, sooner or later you have to take the stairs...I guess the only 
way to truly 100&#37; make sure you don't get MK'd if you have a slow 
computer is to create bnet games yourself and be the first one down. 
This to me is another reason not to MK legits.. what say the 
battlenet public?</pre>
