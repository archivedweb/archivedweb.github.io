&#62; K, so I started a new guy last night. Lag was really bad, 3 steps and 
&#62; it would lag. The guys name was hook hand jimmy, and I decided to 
&#62; start in Vesper. Who knows, maybe I would see BLZ. I started walking 
&#62; around the town, and this b***ch called Syria kille me. I got 
&#62; &#34;Why the hell did you do that?&#34; She goes &#34;Uhh, I wanted 
&#62; to see if I could kill someone.&#34; ******* stupid ******, she can 
&#62; ***** all the way to ******* hell....
&#62; Well, I made a really bad mistake and decided to be a ghost. Why was 
&#62; this a bad idea, you ask? Cause, being the newbie I am, I have no 
&#62; idea where to get resurrected. But it does get worse...
&#62; Now, I should of gone northe of Vesper to the Shrine of Sacrifice, 
&#62; but I decided to go a little water walking. BAD IDEA.
&#62; I got hopelessly lost, and the only land I ever saw was this little 
&#62; island. I also saw a sea serpent, but I was dead so I couldn't do 
&#62; anything. Now this is where it gets REALLY bad-
&#62; I fell through the map. Yes, I fell through the map. Out in the 
&#62; middle of the ocean, half of my body was stuck in the map. Couldn't 
&#62; move anywhere, and to boot that annoying sea serpent kept popping by. 
&#62; So, I go &#34;Hey, no problem, the GM's will help me out 
&#62; (gamemasters)&#34;. So I start paging them. Half an hour later, I'm 
&#62; still stuck there, paging like crazy.
&#62; The moral to this story-  DO NOT BE A GHOST!! BAD THINGS HAPPEN!!
&#62; Then the servers went down, and I went to bed.
&#62; 
&#62; This morning I logged on as Hook again, and I was still there and 
&#62; GM's would not come. Screw this I said, I'm going on as Tyrael.
&#62; So, I log on as Tyrael and find myself in Britain. Britan really 
&#62; sucks, it's loser capital of Britannia. So I decided to venture 
&#62; outside the safe haven of Britain and to go to Trinsic, the cool 
&#62; walled city to the south. There I met with a guy that told me how to 
&#62; copy things to my spellbook and do some other stuff. He then took off 
&#62; for Skarae Brae while I stayed in Trinsic. I then met up with some 
&#62; guy called Ratailin or something like that and MJack. We decided to 
&#62; go and hunt for wolves or rats in the forest. MJack quickly lagged 
&#62; out, but me and whats-his-name went off. The only monster we saw was 
&#62; a sleeping reaper, and we ran off like little girls when I woke it up 
&#62; with my magic bolt. You should of seen it, when I woke it up it 
&#62; started talking to me!! It seems the Reaper and mushroom are closely 
&#62; related.
&#62; We then ventured west until we came to a mountain range. We then 
&#62; tried to look for Destard, but all we found was some Ore. That was 
&#62; good though, we could sell it later. Going further north, we heard 
&#62; someone talking. He kept saying &#34;One second has passed&#34; and 
&#62; stuff like that. We then tried to find the source and we found the 
&#62; Talking embers of Wonder. Well, it wasn't exactly called that, but 
&#62; the embers kept telling us what time it was. We then looked over to 
&#62; his buddy O Log. Not A LOG, it was called O Log. This started making 
&#62; UO look like ALice in Wonderland, so me and whats-his-name split. I 
&#62; then crashed when we came upon a wondering shopkeeper. 
&#62; That's about it so far, stay tuned for more Adventures in UO.
&#62; 
&#62; Take it easy,
&#62; Tyrael
&#62; I AM THE TIGER
This is to a BP to keep it on the QT hand over the UO beta cd and no 
one gets hurt.  I have some useless household items held hostage in 
the nether world OF THE TRIANGLE LAWN and you wont see them again 
unless you hand over the beta cd.  HAND OVER THE CD NOW and no one 
gets hurt.  Dont force me and my covert shock troops to break into 
your house again and take something else to ransom for the UO beta cd 
which you cleverly hid in the cd drive, WHICH to prove how serious i 
am is 12x none the less.  You have 2 hours to hand over the cd or 
your beta vcr, original spiderman movie and the classic TRANSFORMERS 
movies with be D-E-S-T-R-O-Y-E-D.

Noisuf
&#34;In a hostage situation like this its always the small useless 
household items that take the pain for you beta testers&#34; 

Ps - ive done this before i know what im doing i have captured over 
400 uo phase 2 cds this way

PPS - i bet youre wondering why i need your cd if i have 400 already. 
 
PPPS - to answer that i must simply say i have billions and billions 
of dollars and i have lots of computers...i plan on ruling uo with 
1000 of my employees

PPPPS - i bet now you wonder why i dont just offer someone money for 
their cd

PPPPPS - well...come to think of that i just thought of that now...

PPPPPPS - i withdraw all threats...im going to get my cash from my 
vault now</pre>
