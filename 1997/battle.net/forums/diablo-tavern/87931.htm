&#62; I do use bows, lots and lots of bows. So whats my favorite shrine? 
&#62; Weird! The weirder the better! 
&#62; 
&#62; Now I didn't bring ya here to tell ya that, I brought ya here to tell 
&#62; ya I'm an idiot, yep the ol' Cudester is a complete and utter 
&#62; ignoramus. Why? You are asking why? Well, I'll tell ya.
&#62; 
&#62; I am the proud owner of a Savage Bow Heavens {1-14Dam +117&#37; 
&#62; +15All} 
&#62; 
&#62; Now, I spent weeks making that thing 1-19Dam +117&#37; +15All and it 
&#62; was rad, hit Warriors like a mack truck! Yeah Baby, suck that down!
&#62; 
&#62; Well after awhile I had this cool idea. I was going to do some shrine 
&#62; hunts and Get the AC on my GPOW up to 85, yes sir, thats what I was 
&#62; going to do. So I went to Gris and said &#34;Yo, Grizzy baby, give a 
&#62; crap dagger I can hold onto while I shrine my Armor.&#34; So he did, 
&#62; fair price too. And I started hunting the elusive Gloomy. I found it, 
&#62; I found it 5 times. I found out that ALL WEAPONS LOSE 1 FROM MAX 
&#62; DAMAGE IN INVENTORY, IN YOUR HAND, IT DON'T MATTER!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; Now, when did I notice this? Here's the really pathetic part...
&#62; 
&#62; Before my GPOW got eaten by the BBLB (BigBadLagBag) it was; 
&#62; 85AC 90Dur +197&#37;AC +93HP's. Legit, found it myself and it was 
&#62; better than the dupes I've seen anyways. (Do I cry that I don't back 
&#62; things like that up...? ...Sometimes, yes!)
&#62; 
&#62; And my bow is once again 1-14Dam +117&#37; +15All... WHAAAAAAAA!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; I haven't had the patience to do the shrine hunt thing all over 
&#62; again. 
&#62; 
&#62; So no, its not as sad as your tale because I at least have someone to 
&#62; blame. ME!
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for listening, I'm  going to go cry again.
&#62; 
&#62; See ya soon!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;        Cuda       O;)
&#62; 
&#62; If its just a game why does it hurt so much sometimes? Heheh</pre>
