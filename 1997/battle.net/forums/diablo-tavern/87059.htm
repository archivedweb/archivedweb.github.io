&#62;   A few things...  It looks like TheMan is the ONLY one posting on 
&#62; the subject, and the only one wanting war..  TheMan?  If we were to 
&#62; go to war, what would that change? Would you actually FIGHT any of 
&#62; us? HAHAHAHAH...  NO, you wouldnt. War would probly mean us asking 
&#62; for duels, people declining because of fear, and everything would go 
&#62; back to normal. Couldnt you figure that out?...  So, unless you are 
&#62; willing to fight, do not post any crap about war.. it just looks 
&#62; silly. (There are at least 5 PoC that no inferno could beat in fair 
&#62; fights. NO INFERNO.)

Why bother even arguing with The Man?  He STILL won't answer 
perfectly reasonable questions, like:

How he got to lvl 43 with out any dots.
How he pks people with GPOW with his &#34;GrandMother&#34; sword.
Why he calls everyone that offers him a duel a cheat.
Why he won't duel Sammy.  (Sam doesn't cheat)

The Man is a talker.  Someone that can't back up a word of what they 
say.  What he doesn't realize is that he makes himself look dumber 
and dumber every time he posts about fighting.  Everyone knows he 
just hangs around in INFERNO all day.  He never enters public games.

The Man is totally lame.  Good points though Anubis.  Why does he 
even talk about war?

War would just be about 20 of the best pks on b.net vs. The(wo)Man.  
(The biggest wimp that ever played Diablo)

Take a guess at who would win.

Later,
Tabbir-Wons
Animal of Power

P.S.  When will you answer my questions The Man?


&#34;Why does rabbit have more power than man?&#34;</pre>
