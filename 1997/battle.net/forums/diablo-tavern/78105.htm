<pre>  I was looking over the forums today when I considered two things
about the game when it comes to cheaters.
First of all, there have been a few posts from a guy (guys?) who
continues to wait for a patch to come out that eliminates cheating
for another few days.  Thinking about this, I have determined that
the major problem with cheating is that too many people do it.  I
don't blame the downloaders as much as I blame the people who post
these cheats.
  A long time back, I was reading a post from a guy who asked if
there were any secret cheats for Diablo.  At first, I was going to
reply and say &#34;No, there aren't any secret cheats for Diablo.
All the cheats are laying out in the open for everyone to find.&#34;
This is precisely the problem.  The cheaters are distributing
their cheats too freely.
  The solution, therefore, is to keep these hackers from posting
these cheats.  They should consider that this posting isn't helping
the newbies, it is destroying the fun they could be having.  Most
newbies start cheating early in their experience and find it too
difficult to stop.
  Or, for those cheaters who don't care about that, &#34;Hey!  Why is
everyone profiting from your work?  Why don't you keep the cheats
and become more powerful than everyone else on Battlenet?&#34;  (Note:
This does not mean that I approve of cheating.  This is semi-
sarcastic and should not be taken seriously.  Except by cheaters.)
  The second problem are all these new noncheating guilds that can
now be found.  There are simply too many of them.  Worse, they are
posting on Battlenet constantly, and they all use the same idea to
attract people: the fact that there are no cheaters.  I don't
understand why these people don't just join a guild that already
exists.  Or at least give some merits that your guild has that
other noncheating guilds don't.
  This is the end of my opinions for now.  Feel free to respond,
ignore, flame, etc.
