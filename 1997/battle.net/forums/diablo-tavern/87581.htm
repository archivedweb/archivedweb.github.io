&#62; &#62; har har har INFERNO? nice TO...what an example to the new 
&#62; &#62; recruits...btw for the record let me say that when dueling without 
&#62; &#62; his hacked nova, Haplo sucks big nut at dueling, he just runs 
&#62; &#62; away...also if you didn't catch torque's post...the staff was NOT a 
&#62; &#62; hack...HAPLO was the hack...i dunno how he got it so only his nova 
&#62; &#62; and not his fireball did autokill...but he did it...and Haplo, if 
&#62; &#62; these are the &#34;skills&#34; you are always bragging about, then 
&#62; &#62; you can KEEP THEM...and torque FYI...i gots 982 mana :) and a level 
&#62; &#62; 20 ball...i don't think even a 38 level nova could take that mana 
&#62; &#62; shield down...we're talking like level 90 nova or something here 
&#62; &#62; :)...so inferno?...my advice: kick out theman, he's about to get you 
&#62; &#62; into a war with the PoC...kick out haplo, he is a sorry cheater...and 
&#62; &#62; make DarkMage or Mitchell TO...they are cool, if not a bit dull for 
&#62; &#62; staying in INFERNO...oh yeah, keep that Adam dude from Blizzard as 
&#62; &#62; TO...maybe he can get Blizzard to help INFERNO from dying...naw, 
&#62; &#62; never mind...NOTHING can save INFERNO now :P
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Pyro-Friar of Fire
&#62; 
&#62; Damn you people are stupid...a level 20 Nova could take your Mana 
&#62; Ball down and all your health as well..Nova is very powerful..trust 
&#62; me on this, I use to test level 30 nova's out all the time..they 
&#62; could knock off 33 million everytime...There not autokill autokill is 
&#62; where he can just sit anywhere and kill you..autokill is now 
&#62; realtivly impossible ..So either you died by Nova and you can't take 
&#62; it that you lost ..or ..there is no or


And uh how do you get a level 20 nova in a legit non cheating duel....
Answer you don't. Best you can hope for would be a level 6 IF spell 
raising items like aa staff and Nij's light plate have an effect on 
non-book spells, which I don't know to be true but whicjh I am going 
to experiment and find out.  If they don't have an effect, then the 
best you can hope for is a level 2 NOVA and to individual targets 
that does less then 100 damage points per bolt when cast by an under 
level 40 mage.  even assuming you can use the level 6 spell, so lets 
add
40 pts per level to get it to 260 per bolt and then assuming a level 
45 sorcerer casting we add another 20 pts per level for a total of 
460 per bolt that is still the max damage without considering 
resistances and it is far short of the 11-1300 a fireball can dish 
out. And this is with very generous damge assumptions. There is no 
way an unhacked nova staff, aa or otherwise, can kill a full mana 
ball, man shield up mage in one ring, anyone who says otherwise is 
lying. </pre>
