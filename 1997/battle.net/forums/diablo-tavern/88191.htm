<pre>The experience needed for Level 49 is 1,082,908,612 XP.
The experience needed for Level 50 is 1,310,707,109 XP.

Therefore, the XP needed to go from Level 49 to 50 is
227,798,497 XP (it's late and I just did that without a calculator,
so I may be off).  Being generous, let's say 225 million XP.

Assuming 10 XP/kill, achieving Level 50 would require 22.5 
million kills.  Assuming 1 kill/second, this is 22.5 million seconds,
or 375,000 minutes, or 6250 hours, or approximately 260 days of
actual playing time (playing around the clock).

Assuming 10,000 XP per Hell/Hell run, and being generous and
estimating 1 hour per run, achieving Level 50 would require 
22,500 runs, or 22,500 hours, or approximately 168 days of actual 
playing time.

Using these assumptions, going from Level 49 to 50 in only two
weeks appears unlikely.  Of course, the assumptions about
XP/kill or XP/run could be off by one or more orders of 
magnitude (I have no way of knowing until I reach level 48 or so
myself).  I receive approximately 1.2 to 1.4 million XP per Hell/Hell
level now at Level 46.  If TheMan received 1 million XP per
Hell/Hell run, for example, achieving Level 50 would require only
225 runs.  Assuming 1 hr/run, this would require 225 hours, or
9 to 10 days of around-the-clock playing.

As I said above, it's late and my calculations may be off.  Any way
you look at it, however, achieving Level 50 in only two weeks 
seems very unlikely.

&#62; I don't think the question is, can you get to level 50? The question 
&#62; is, can you do it in so short a time as TheMan claims to have done? I 
&#62; don't remember exactly how long ago he turned 49 (does someone?), but 
&#62; it was about two weeks ago if I recall correctly. Now I've put in 
&#62; some serious playing time in the last two weeks, and only got about 
&#62; two-thirds of the way from 41 to 42 in that time. But then, only in 
&#62; the last few days have I been serious about trying to gain XP. 
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan says that at level 49 you get about 10 XP per kill. I don't 
&#62; know how much XP it takes to go from level 49 to 50, but let's say 
&#62; it's 200 million. Ok, to be conservative, let's say 100 million. This 
&#62; means that you'd need to kill 10 million baddies to do it. If TheMan 
&#62; killed one guy per second (a pretty liberal estimate for a warrior, 
&#62; factoring in stops to reload belt and trips to town), 24 hours a day, 
&#62; that'd take him 115 days (nearly four months) to do this. To do it in 
&#62; 8 hours a day, like he says he did, it would take 345 days, or about 
&#62; a year. To do it in two weeks, he'd have to have played 197 hours a 
&#62; day. 
&#62; 
&#62; Using his other estimate, that you get 10K per Hell/Hell clear, if he 
&#62; could clear Hell/hell in two hours (again, a liberal estimate for 
&#62; anyone... especially a warrior who insists on using a Grandfather, 
&#62; which can't stun witches and mages), that'd be 40K XP a day. Thus 
&#62; it'd take him 250 days (8 months) to accumulate 100 million XP (or 
&#62; just 85 days if he did it 24 hours a day). To do this in two weeks, 
&#62; he'd have to have played 143 hours a day. 
&#62; 
&#62; TheMan, I'm not trying to be mean to you. I'm not prosecuting you, 
&#62; I'm defending the bragging rights of true high level legits. If you 
&#62; can show me my arithmetic error here and prove that you are in fact a 
&#62; legit 50, then I will say that you are in fact a Diablo God (I will 
&#62; bow down to anyone who can get to 50!). However, it would seem 
&#62; mathematically to be nearly impossible that anyone could have done it 
&#62; in the amount of time that's passed since January 6, let alone since 
&#62; June 6. 
&#62; 
&#62; Please TheMan, point out my mistake. If you're legit, I must've made 
&#62; an obvious one (or maybe the data you gave me to work with had a 
&#62; margin of error of 246&#37;). If you're not legit, you'll simply 
&#62; reply with a &#60;no text&#62; at the end of your subject, or maybe 
&#62; stop and take the time to show me you care by mindlessly flaming me.
