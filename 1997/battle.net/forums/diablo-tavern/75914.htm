&#62; I dont recall saying anything that was increadibly offensive. I don't 
&#62; recall saying anything against Blizzard. However it appears as though 
&#62; those at Blizzard have different ideas about that since my posts and 
&#62; even my responses to posts seem to be dissapearing.
&#62; 
&#62; If Blizz.Sup is bothering to read this I would apreciate some kind of 
&#62; explanation as to why I qualified for this action. At least that way 
&#62; I can alert others to the danger.
&#62; 
&#62; I have always enjoyed this board and I think I added to the enjoyment 
&#62; for others. 
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, I would like to know why, and how this is possible. 
&#62; 
&#62; See ya all soon, or maybe not?

&#62; PS: To anyone reading this (before it disapears of course) shoot off 
&#62; a post about it and see how many posts they will wipe out. Unless you 
&#62; fear being banned, then I will understand, of course.

Cuda,

If you are still posting here, then you have not been banned.  Your 
posts may have been deleted, however, if they were responses to posts 
that were deleted for going against our posting guidelines.

When a person has been banned, he/she will no longer be able to post 
on the forums (we do not delete each of their posts as they come in).

I hope that clarifies,
Pat N.</pre>
