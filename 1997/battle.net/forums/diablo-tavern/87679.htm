<pre>Hello,
this is a very LONG post, please keep a clear mind while reading, it 
can get very confusing. :)
You might have heard, i quit INFERNO. I tried to convince some other 
members to let it die. This totally bummed me out. Why I quit was a 
nasty and stupid chain of events.
Alrighty, to start with, i joined INFERNO during January. I wasn't 
particularly active, but i hanged out in the channel alot. Well, not 
alot of people seemed interested in talking to me, and that pissed me 
off. I was in the Trading Post one day, and suddenly, a person named 
kattClawer messages me. I had no idea who he was before. He says to me
&#34;Oh no Lionel, not you!&#34;  
I ask, what is wrong, what did i do?
he said that i came into the inferno chat room and spammed very 
frequently
Now, this was not me, it was a clone, and katt said some complained 
to peg. I told katt it was a clone, and i forgot all about, till....

SCENE: 6 months later, tonight
i got panicky about the survival of inferno today. I started talkin 
about stuff to that matter. Well, i was on the edge, tetering between 
stay and leave. Flux messages me, asking me if i am gonna quit. I 
said, i will see now. In walks PegLegRogue into the channel. 
I ask Peg for a duel
no response
i ask again
no response
i ask one more time!
then he says this, and i quote:
Linal you fucken kid i dont know why your parents get you internet 
access.
Flux messages again, asking if i am gonna quit, i said
Theres your answer
BOOM, i was smacked into the void, banned, for no reason other than 
asking for a duel. Thats odd. Now that i was really considering 
quitting, i put into action my lil experiment. If i reached the top 
of the void list, without anyone asking me to come back or anything 
like that, I would be done with INFERNO. 15 minutes later, i reached 
the top, went to snakegod channel and announced my resignation.

here comes the exciting part:

Peg eventualy leaves the channel, therefor, i am not banned now. i go 
in, i talk about it with the others in the inferno channel. I got 
invited to join Mayhem more than once. 
Tada! In walks Pegleg. i ask him why he cussed me out and banned me 
several times. He replies that i have been a pain in inferno for too 
long. I ask for the next 20 minutes how i am being a pain. No reply.
I then, challenge Peg to a duel in front of everyone. After Minion 
unloaded some of his best shit onto Peg, i got into the game, and the 
duel began. Well, before i go down, i say, 8 belt potions only.
Okay now. i just got to bottom of stairs, i raise my mana shield, and 
out pops a Pegleg who proceeds to jump and kill me. I did not fight 
it. 
HOW BOUT SAYING GO ER SOMETHING NEXT TIME, i yell
alright, i now have 7 potions, using one full rejuv after i get back 
down from restarting. We both say go, and he teleports like a mad man.
i pump him full of my measly level 15 fireballs, and he is still 
teleporting all around me 
    (i died in a hell/hell pk, everyone timed out, i have shit)
I teleport off, and say, that had to hurt!
Peg goes, ya baby, hurts alot.
this puzzles me very much
Duel goes on, he wins, i using the last of my EIGHT potions.
i went, FUck, how many pots did you use?

    -=+ THIS IS THE BIG MOMENT PEOPLE, SEE HOW HE RESONDS +=-

He said (drumroll) I refilled my belt 3 times.

THREE TIMES????? i scream THERE ARE ONLY 8 POTIONS IN THIS DUEL

he responds by saying,I brought 30 bottles down. There are no rules, 
if there are, the winner makes them.

That was where i lose a few IQ points
I USED THE ONLY 8 POTIONS I HAD AND DIED, I MADE HIM USE 24 POTIONS.
????????????????????????????????????????????????????
does this sound fair?
no, it doesn't
in fact, it is #*&()#|  and *#)#@*

PEGLEGROGUE, TECHNICALLY I SHOULD HAVE BEAT YOU WITH 5 POTS TO SPARE
I DEMAND A REMATCH!


This is not a hateful post, but i am not done.

We then talk for the next hour, we didn't duel again. We talk about 
TheMan and Haplo. I ask why he said i was a pain again. He tells me 
he has recieved some complaints about me a while ago.
BINGO!
That first incident with kattClawer and my clone was the cause of 
this. I tell him that was just a clone, and things are alright 
between us now.   &#60;|:-)

We then talked about the future of INFERNO,
He also told me that in two weeks, an announcement will be made that 
will supposedly quadruple INFERNO membership
thats still not alot even, hehehehehe
Then we talk about hour both of our equipment sucks and he leaves teh 
game. 
Well whaddayaknow, in pops Ineluki, who i have had something of a 
fued with lately. Reminder, i have level 15 fireball, and 728 mana  
(ugh)
He has 839 mana and level 16 ball  (grrrr)
I finally duel him, took one of his ears, he took one of mine.
Hehehe, i tend to collect ears i get, And i wasn't lettin this puppy 
go. He says that he didn't deserve my ear, because after i resed him 
the first time, he refilled his belt,  GODDAMNIT
i had only 2 pots left on that last duel, and he had 8
guess who won
i made him use 3 of those pots, with my measly ball and crap mana.
He says he didn't deserve my ear, and we should trade. hehe, i leave 
the game. i'm so naughty &#62;;-)       (i collect ears, deal with it)

And that, my friends, was the most confusing post i have ever wrote, 
and i haven't slept in 3 days. god my head hurts.</pre>
