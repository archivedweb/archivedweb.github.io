<pre>Hello my friends,
     This poem has nothing to do with diablo, I just like it.  It  is 
a classic.  You can get the rhythm even after all these years. It was 
written in the mid 1800's. Enjoy, and put the kiddies to bed. :)

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
 '' 'Tis some visitor,'' I muttered, ''tapping at my chamber door-
                Only this, and nothing more.'' 
  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
 Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
 From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
                         Nameless here for evermore. 
   And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
  Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
   '' 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
                         This it is, and nothing more.'' 
  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
''Sir,'' said I, ''or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you''- here I opened wide the door;-
                       Darkness there, and nothing more. 
  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, 
fearing,
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
 But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ''Lenore!''
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ''Lenore!''-
                Merely this, and nothing more. 
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
 Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
 ''Surely,'' said I, ''surely that is something at my window lattice:
 Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-
                 'Tis the wind and nothing more.'' 
   Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
   Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-
                           Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
  ''Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,'' I said, ''art sure 
no craven,
  Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!''
                              Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
  Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;
   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
 Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                            With such name as ''Nevermore.'' 
 But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
 Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-
 Till I scarcely more than muttered, ''other friends have flown 
before-
  On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.''
                     Then the bird said, ''Nevermore.'' 
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
 ''Doubtless,'' said I, ''what it utters is its only stock and store,
 Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-
 Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                      Of 'Never- nevermore'.'' 
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and 
door;
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                      Meant in croaking ''Nevermore.'' 
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
              She shall press, ah, nevermore! 
Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
  Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
  ''Wretch,'' I cried, ''thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he 
                            hath sent thee
 Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!
 Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!''
                          Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
 ''Prophet!'' said I, ''thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!-
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-
On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-
  Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!''
                          Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
   ''Prophet!'' said I, ''thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or 
devil!
  By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-
     Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.''
                             Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
  ''Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,'' I shrieked, 
upstarting-
  ''Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
 Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
   Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
                        door!''
              Quoth the Raven, ''Nevermore.'' 
  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
   On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
   And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                        Shall be lifted- nevermore! 

P.S. How basic the rhythm of the poem, don't you think?  Yet so 
inviting, and so captivating.  Goodnight my friends, hope the morning 
bring with it something more.  Forgive the lack of Diablo relation. :)
