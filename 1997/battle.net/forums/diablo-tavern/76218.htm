<pre>       i just recently started playing diablo again after a couple of 
months when one of my friends got it.  i figured that i would play 
with him and build up another character for the fun of it.  well i 
built him up to level 19, my friend is still 9 , and actually i still 
havent played with him. (this does have a point so keep reading)  
last night one of our mutual friends, Iblis_Sefiroth, wanted us all 
to play together, actually he just wanted to take the level 9 guy's 
ear.  the only way we could is to get on Battle Net, so we did, or at 
least tried to.  we never could play a game because we kept lagging 
out.  well all this got me interested in taking ears again, so i got 
on earlier tonight to hunt. now as i said i am only a level 19 , 
actually 20 now, so i was looking for fairly easy prey.  i joined at 
least 10 games and out of all the ones that i saw all of the people 
in them were cheated.  of coarse i couldnt take any of them on 
because they had gopw's or something as good, and i only have an AC 
of about 83.  newbies will never get to play a fair game on battle 
net because of all the cheaters.   i mean i have been around for 
quite a while, hell i still remember Wynd, and it is not as good as 
it was when it started.  i doubt that it ever will be.  everyone and 
their mom is in INFERNO now.  i got in INFERNO when it was still 
around 160 people, right after its prime.  now i believe that there 
is around 700.  i dont keep track of it anymore.  peg has quit, and 
flux now leads it, i believe.  when i was in the INFERNO channel i 
didnt see anyone there that i remember.  all it was was a jumble of 
ascii names.   i went into the snakegod channel for lack of anywhere 
to go and found at least one cool guy that i played with for about 5 
minutes. he even lent me 3000 to get a fireball book , my first with 
this char.  i wont tell you who he is because salmissra( god now she 
has been around for a long time, what are her posts on 51?)  might 
get mad at him for helping a pk.  actually all that im really saying 
is that i feel sorry for all the newbies that will never get the 
feeling of finding their first ring, they get the best to start off 
with.  they will never play battle net the way it was supposed to be 
played, i didnt get to for too long before all the cheats for version 
1.0 came out.  i intend to still play for a little while at least and 
build my guy up so i can kill some cheaters and take their hacked 
shit and let gris hold it, now freelance though. even though it will 
do no good they probally have it backed up anyway. still its the 
thought that counts.
