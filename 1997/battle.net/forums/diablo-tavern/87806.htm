<pre>On Wed Jul 16 11:00, mgP wrote:
&#62; The following is addressed to all members of Inferno, all members of 
&#62; the PoC, and all others I know on battle.net.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm just going to say it right here: I am leaving battle.net. I have 
&#62; grown frustrated to the point at which it seems that player killing 
&#62; no longer has a purpose within Diablo - you can't kill one person in 
&#62; ten because of all the adolescent cheaters running around. After 
&#62; spending hours upon hours and days upon days trying to kill just one 
&#62; other player, I have concluded that my time online can be better 
&#62; spent than pushing myself through this.
&#62; 
&#62; Thus, since I am leaving battle.net, I resign from Inferno. Not only 
&#62; the Diablo division, but Inferno UO also. When I designed the Inferno 
&#62; UO web page, I knew that the chance of I paying for UO was slim - I 
&#62; already pay for my ISP bill, and don't yet have a job (a 15 year old 
&#62; kid can't get jobs too easily in a small town like this). I just 
&#62; designed the Inferno UO web page to gain a little respect from my 
&#62; fellow members, to benefit the federation, and to be recognized by 
&#62; some outsiders (I even got kudos from our &#34;sworn enemy&#34; Talon 
&#62; / Sexy-Rogue). I thought I would only reveal this once Ultima Online 
&#62; went retail, but not at this current time.
&#62; 
&#62; Third, I am formally declining my invite to the PoC. No offense - you 
&#62; guys are some of the coolest on battle.net; but if I am never going 
&#62; to play Diablo online again, and never pay for UO, where would that 
&#62; leave me in the PoC? An observer at most. Personally, I think that 
&#62; each member of a guild should at least remain active or serve a 
&#62; purpose. If I were to join the PoC, being just an &#34;observer&#34; 
&#62; would fulfill neither of these roles.
&#62; 
&#62; I feel shook as I leave battle.net. In my online time, I have built 
&#62; up a Level 39 Warrior, a Level 30 Sorcerer, and a Level 40 Rogue. I 
&#62; had many good times with friends online, playing co-op and 
&#62; &#34;deathmatch&#34; games alike (oh yeah, pk too), and feel that the 
&#62; time taken to build up these characters has not been wasted - despite 
&#62; the times I have had to suffer the antics and ignorance of cheaters.
&#62; 
&#62; I will, however, still periodically catch the news on Ogden's Tavern 
&#62; and may occasionally logon to battle.net for a chat with friends - 
&#62; but it is unlikely that I will ever enter another game again. Diablo 
&#62; was a great game long ago, and the people I met were cool, but times 
&#62; have changed since then.
&#62; 
&#62; It is also highly unlikely that I will ever rejoin Inferno or the PoC 
&#62; again. If I did, it just wouldn't feel right deep down inside. Thus, 
&#62; if I do return to battle.net or pay for Ultima Online, I will go in 
&#62; as a freelance. I say this not out of hatred, but out of respect.
&#62; 
&#62; I leave you all now, but I still wish to stay in touch with most of 
&#62; you I knew. If you wish to contact me, you may e-mail me, or look me 
&#62; up on ICQ under mgP or the UIN 782041. However, tomorrow I will be 
&#62; leaving for a 10-day trip, so I will not be able to make contact with 
&#62; you until my return.
&#62; 
&#62; In a way, I sort of knew it would always come down to this
&#62; 
&#62; Good luck and god bless,
&#62; 
&#62; mgP
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Dreams may be shattered, but memories last forever.&#34;

When I decided to quit b.net, mgP was there pleading with me to stay. 
The last game I ever played with my full version character was with 
mgP. We entered that game with the warrior with 19000000 hp and the 
dupers and the ghost.. remember that mgP? YOu begged meto stay but I 
had to leave. 

      I will not beg you to stay and I am sorry that I wasn't there 
when you decided to leave :( I wish you all the best and hey... if 
you ever buy a lottary ticket, pick the numbers 39,30,40 ......... 
you never know :)
Later,
                                         LowRider(INFERNO UO)

&#34;when a legend dies, a new hero is born for the next generation. 
Godd-bye mgP&#34;</pre>
