<pre>As I was reading the thread, I was getting more and more irritated at 
all the whining going on. It was to the point that I was going to 
post something on the 1st page. Fortunately, Discordia posted here a 
message with which I can mostly agree. I am also grateful and happy 
to live in those times and in a place where consumption and 
materialism are highly valued. Only in those circumstances can true 
freedom be achieved and exercised. In an anthill society that Wiseman 
seems to be advocating (no individual waste, everyone working for the 
good of the collective) there's no individual lifestyle choice 
possible, while in the materialistic society one can pursue happiness 
in any way he desires (also by asceticism that Wiseman seems to 
propose).
A couple of myths that seem to return no matter what the facts.

Golden age: in the past things were better, people cared for each 
other, there was little crime, and no pollution. Luckily Discordia 
has already broken up some of that: disease and lack of hygiene that 
are inherent to non-industrial societies were abundant in the past. 
Some interesting statistics show, that also crime rate in the past 
was much higher than in the present. As to people beeing more 
caring...well did anyone hear about Maslov's chierarchy of needs? No 
way people were more considerate of others back then. Maybe they 
worked closer together at times, but that was only when the survival 
of the entire population was at stake: be it famine, war or natural 
disaster. If there ever was a period in human history we can call 
&#34;golden age&#34; it is the one we are living in.

Corporate Empires. I cannot understand that one at all. Seems like 
the opponents of &#34;waste&#34; should be in favor of big 
corporations. They are much more efficient than small business, just 
like trains are more efficient than cars. Also, the big corporations 
are probably the best places to aork at. They provide the widest 
range of benefits, and sense of security, that so many people above 
seemed to long for. As to corporate &#34;waste&#34; on advertising... 
a brief look into the budgets would reveal that only about 5&#37; of 
the profit is spent on advertising. To whine about 5&#37; and not see 
where the other 95 is going is just the type of thinking that got me 
irritated to the point of writing this lengthy post.

Want to complain about waste in present society? Consider this: 
50&#37; of the U.S. GNP ends up in the government's hand. Now, this 
is a very low figure for a &#34;civilized&#34; country. In Europe 
that figure is closer to 70&#37;. Now, what happens to the money that 
the government gets? Some 10&#37; is spent on maintaining peace and 
security through the justice system, police and the military. Some 
gets invested in public works which could be done much cheaper by 
private initiative. But most of that money is completely wasted on 
bureaucracy and redistribution that do not benefit the society one 
bit. So there, corporations &#34;waste&#34; maybe 5&#37; of their 
profit on advertising (all advertising makes up..oh maybe 1&#37; of 
the GNP), while governments get over 50&#37; of GNP to waste as they 
please and nobody seems to have a problem with that. More so, I am 
certain that many people who posted above would like to see 
governments &#34;take charge&#34; - meaning higher budgets.

I can go on and on explaining why Wiseman's &#34;objective&#34; world 
view is not one bit objective but determined by the same commercial 
news media that he probably dislikes so much. I think where the 
difference in opinion lies is a different view of mankind. Wiseman, 
and most authors above view mankind as &#34;fallen angels&#34; 
capable of perfection and life in harmony. Me, I see, a bunch of 
creatures with very limited intellectual capabilities who are trying 
to get along with each other and survive in hostile environment. They 
are stumbling along the way, but nevertheless they are making 
astonishing progress in every aspect of their quest.
