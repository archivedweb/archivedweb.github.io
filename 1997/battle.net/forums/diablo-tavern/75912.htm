<pre>You are quite correct.  I am not trying to say that I don't want them 
to post here, I welcome anyone who has anything intelligent to say to 
post.  It's just the 'internal' stuff that I don't feel belongs here. 
 There are many posts by Inferno (and of course other guild/clan 
members) members that I enjoy reading.  I too have been reading this 
forum since early Feb (rarely posting though), and I enjoyed all of 
the stories and general Diablo talk that went on here, as I believe 
that is what this particuliar forum was for.  It seems that not much 
of that sort goes on here anymore, and I would just like it back :)

I often do skip over posts such as 'I am quitting Inferno', 'To all 
Inferno:', and such like that, I was just wondering, and assuming, 
that if they posted those messages on their own message board, it 
would reach more of their members, rather than telling everyone who 
reads the forum.

Again, I am not against members of Inferno posting, I enjoy it, but I 
hope you see what I am trying to say.

(Although I would much rather read those Inferno posts than BEST 
CHEATS HERE!!! or JOIN THE BEST PK GUILD ON THE POLANET!, I always 
skip over any post with a title in all caps...hehe)</pre>
