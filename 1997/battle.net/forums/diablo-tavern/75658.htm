<pre>Man, newbie killing is one of the funnest things to do now on B-net. 
I encourage all bored pks to try it. Just:
1. Make a new guy
2. Make sure you don't accept gifts unless you sell them right away
3. Start killing newbies
It is, in my opinion, more fun due to the smaller number of cheaters. 
There are a lot of people who will accept gifts and be wearing plate 
but the hardcore hackers with god mode, auto kill, and hacked spells 
are harder to find, making it easier to kill a victim. I also suggest 
doing it cooperatively with a second person, or if you have a group 
of 3, make a new game so that only one person will show up.

I think the funniest story we had was when Ragnarock (me), Phalanx 
(Firebrand), and Darxyl(Fusion) were all waiting in a new game we had 
called: Kill Butch!. I was hoping we could open a portal to town in 
Butch's lair and let the hapless victims come down and meet their 
doom. However we were about to go down to the church when a guy 
decked in plate showed up. Now earlier Dar had made a new thievery 
tecnique. This tecnique is when you act like a total newbie and ask 
them why they are so cool looking in that armor, and then you ask 
them if you can see the armor. Well, since the guy was in plate and 
we wouldn't get a chance to kill him Dar used this tecnique. However, 
he was an autoduper and made copies for us all. So I got an idea, and 
we all started acting like complete newbies who bought the game that 
very day. Well, it was very funny. When I dropped the armor the guy 
had given me (GPOW of course) it deleted the other suit of armor on 
the floor and we all said it was a glitch in the game. The cheater 
said it wasn't a glitch but we kept asking him to leave to get rid of 
the glitch. In the end he threatened to pk us and we ran around the 
village. It was pretty funny. So, if you're bored going around pking 
with your level 20+ guy try some newbie killing. It's really quite 
fun.
