<pre>Lately, with EVERYONE wanting Strange Swords of Haste and Gold Rings 
of Perfection, it seems the topic is now Accuracy Vs. Damage.  Well, 
let us debate.

As Eugene and several others said, if you can't hit, you can't 
damage. Yet, if you had a Strange Sword of Haste, say 6-15 Bastard 
Sword Style, and you can now hit the enemy all you want!!  Problem 
is, being a mage or a rogue, you may only do about 30 damage per hit, 
not fun.  Even as a warrior, you can maybe only do about 60-70 
damage, but all of the shots hit :)

Now, say you have the Merciless sword of Slaughter, 6-15 Bastard 
Sword, +20 points of damage to damage, plus 114&#37; damage.  Wow, it 
kicks, it breaks an enemy in two...but, what if you can't even HIT 
the damn target?  You can now clean up on damage, yet you maybe hit 1 
time out of 7.

So, which is more important?

Simple:  Both need to exist in harmony.  So, what weapon do you need?

King's Swords ARE that medium, but we all know that 98&#37; of all 
King's Swords are dupes.  And, we have not even talked about other 
weapons, like Staves, Bows, etc...so, let us.

Rogues have no problem with being accurate. They have the Dexerity to 
back it up, so they are covered.  When it comes to damage, they just 
need a good bow. :)

Mages have their spells, but when they need to exchange regular 
wacks, Dreamflanges are their cup of tea.

So, Warriors?  What do WE use?

Okay, Axes are fun when they hit the enemy, and clubs and maces and 
morning stars are fun for bashing the undead and little enemies.  
But, we also need to worry about Hammers and Mauls.  It goes on and 
on.

The point is, there is ONE weapon that is VERY avaible, easily found, 
and one of the most accurate and damaging weapons, and even level 4 
people can find one and start player killing.

The weapon?  The Grandfather.

10-20 base damage, plus 70&#37; damage, plus 20&#37; hit, plus 20 HP, 
plus 5 all, one handed.  You can now have a good damage, accurate 
weapon and still keep your shield.  Also, it is accurate with that 
20&#37; hit increase the bonuses are overall well.

So, what is more important to you, hit &#37; or damage &#37;?  Over 
all, I think the thing you need it a balance of both.
