<pre>First Blz_Bob joins PoC, and now you are petitioning for membership! 
It seems that all of the noteworthy &#34;independents&#34; are giving 
up the solitary life. . . (You didn't mention the clan, but from your 
comment about PKing and based on the posts about PoC, my first guess 
is that group.)

And congratulations on *finally* reaching Level 40.  Don't get dizzy 
from the lack of oxygen at these heights . . .  you already seem to 
get dizzy enough in the presence of a pretty rogue!

&#62; Hello my friends,
&#62; 	For the past couple days I have been creeping up on level 40.  Last 
&#62; night I got myself within 500,000 experience points, but I couldn't 
&#62; bring myself to get the level.  I sat around pondering life, thinking 
&#62; about how long I had been in my thirties  
&#62; 	You see, in 6 months I have never made level 40 with any of my 
&#62; characters. 
&#62; 	Then I woke up this morning at the crack of noon, feeling good to be 
&#62; alive.  I logged onto ICQ, and chatted for a couple hours.  Then I 
&#62; got a message from none other than the big snake herself,  SALMISSRA. 
&#62; 	We hadn't chatted in a couple months, so we naturally got talking 
&#62; about old times, and I casually mentioned that I was on the brink of 
&#62; level 40.  So we decided to start a game, name Level 40 (never can 
&#62; remember how to spell forty, always want to add a 'u' in there, 
&#62; thought that would be safer, but I digress), I forget the Password.
&#62; 	I joined, and went down to hell and, as I always do when with a 
&#62; pretty Rogue, I started showing off my nifty spells.  Teleporting 
&#62; into a room, and chain lightning until everything is dead, waiting 
&#62; for her to say &#34;OOOHHHH, AAAHHHH, OOOOOOOOO&#34; as she watches 
&#62; the fireworks.  Unfortunately, my ego has always been a bit bigger 
&#62; than my mana shield, and I died not five minutes later.
&#62; 	It is very hard to keep up a macho attitude when you are lying on 
&#62; the floor whimpering and asking for a res, trust me. I have had a lot 
&#62; of experience at that. I restarted in town, on the guise of needing 
&#62; mana, but really because I didn't want to look like an idiot sitting 
&#62; on that floor while she killed all the monsters.
&#62; 	I recovered quickly, and said I had done it on purpose, because I 
&#62; wanted to try to make level 40 naked.  How's that for quick thinking? 
&#62;  So I collected all the stuff that would fit in my inventory, and 
&#62; left the rest where my body was.
&#62; 	Then I kept teleporting around and killing stuff.  I don't know why, 
&#62; but I have always had luck when I am playing naked.  Perhaps it is 
&#62; because I am a lot more timid when I know I can't handle more than a 
&#62; few hits from the nightmare beasts.  Anyhow, I did a lot better than 
&#62; I had done before.
&#62; 	Soon I got my level, and I didn't even notice it.  I just saw my 
&#62; mana go up, right after I had pressed a potion and thought it was 
&#62; lag.  Then I noticed that when I said something it said -=|)elfontes=-
&#62;  level 40!  I was very excited, and had saved my ego with that naked 
&#62; part.  :)
&#62; 	I went back to get my stuff and get dressed, then went with Sal to 
&#62; kill Laz.  We didn't find anything good, but it is never a total loss 
&#62; when you get a level out of it. 
&#62; 
&#62;                                                                      
&#62;       ~Fin~
&#62; 
&#62; -=|)elfontes=-    	level 40 Sorcerer.
&#62; Lestat                 	level 32 Rogue
&#62; Jordash		Level 28 Warrior
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. I think I have found a cure for this boring co-op play.  I was 
&#62; playing with a friend later in the day, and I am trying to do 
&#62; something that I have not done in my entire career on b.net.  Yup, -
&#62; =|)elfontes=- is petitioning to join a guild.  Watch out, the 
&#62; pkilling days of my youth might soon return. :)
&#62; More to come on that one, unless I am not accepted, in which case you 
&#62; can ignore what I just said. </pre>
