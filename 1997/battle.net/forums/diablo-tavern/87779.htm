<pre>Well folks I learned some valuable lessons last night. I was hanging 
out with Tarot and decided to test some of my backup equipment. 
Keyla, Kargan and Sir.DesChenes were kind enough to come along on a 
Hell / Hell run with me. These are the things I found out myself.

(1) I cannot take the punishment from monsters I used to be able to. 
I lost my GPOW and my RC to the BBLB (Big Bad Lag Bag) and because of 
that my AC has dropped about 100 points. I teleported into a nest of 
Vipers and found out very quickly how much I relied on that AC. If it 
wasn’t for the help of Sir.DesChenes, Kargan and Keyla I may very 
well have lost my replacement equipment!  O;)

(2) I have a solo mentality. I have played, hunted and fought alone 
for so long that playing with others is going to have a learning 
curve involved. I didn't accidentally hose anyone, (I left that to 
Kargan and his wicked fireballs, Heheh) but I was in the way a bit. I 
didn't get killed by another player (the next one also deals with 
that) but I was kind of hanging back or rushing forward at 
inopportune times.

(3) I am optimized for PK. I found that when Kargan nailed me with a 
fireball (accidentally) I took it with little problem. When Keyla hit 
me with a few well placed arrows I noticed I took them with little 
problem. When I got three Knights on me I noticed I was swallowing 
Full Rejuve like it was water! I need to optimize for either Co-op or 
hunting and I suppose that means I'll have a few Pack_Mules designed 
to carry my various setup EQ for me.

These are things I will need to work on if I am taken in by Tarot.

The basic contention as I understand it so far is, Braveheart Emperor 
of Tarot wants to have the guild decide if bounty hunting should 
remain of the guild or not. There is a dichotomy there, a non-PK 
guild that has members who PK. Also, IF Bounty Hunting is to remain a 
part of the guild and IF I hold the office of Death will I be able to 
accept bounties from people outside the guild. 

I am anxiously awaiting their judgment on these issues.

Oh and Flux and I had a little chat last night and I had to say again 
that Cuda is not a murderer, she is a vigilante. When and if we get 
to UO I will hunt Inferno not run with them. Now maybe I would be 
willing to team up and slag some friends in PoC, but we will have to 
wait and see. I have heard there are bow weapons in UO, BLZ can you 
confirm that for me? I will be quite bummed if they don't. You know 
how much I like the sneak attack from range thing.  O;)

That’s what's up with me lately, how bout you?
