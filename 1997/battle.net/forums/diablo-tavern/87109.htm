&#62; Blizzard-
&#62; When I paid my $48.73 for my CD of Diablo, I wasn't aware I'd be 
&#62; subjugated to the whims of childish profanity, spamming, and the 
&#62; constant 
&#62; use of nicknames I can't even copy to squelch due to their incessant 
&#62; use of 
&#62; symbols.  I think if Blizzard is going to offer a chat as a way to 
&#62; hook up with 
&#62; others to play their product, then they should have the insight to 
&#62; know that 
&#62; there has to be some standards of decorum and some way of enforcing 
&#62; them.  Perhaps you all should take a look at Westwood chat for an 
&#62; example.  
&#62; My suggestion to you all is to make the chat where a channel op is 
&#62; present in 
&#62; every channel and to take some of the profits from the 13 million you 
&#62; boast 
&#62; so proudly about, and hire some system operators.  Many of my friends 
&#62; no 
&#62; longer play the game because of these unruly infantile adolescents, 
&#62; and have 
&#62; sworn off Blizzard products all together.  Since, most of these 
&#62; children can 
&#62; not afford your price for a CD, whereas my friends, and the other 
&#62; adults on 
&#62; bnet can, it seems like a bad business strategy to allow this to 
&#62; continue.
&#62; Thank you for your time.


At this time, Blizzard, battle.net is not a &#34;Best-in-Class&#34; 
operation.
You have thrived and prospered due to the uniqueness of the
service provided.  In the battle for the entertainmet dollar, however,
you are destined for the bottom of the heap unless significant
changes are made to your service.  Something has to be done to
control the rampant and mindless idiocy in the chat rooms, i.e., the
vulgarity, the hit-and-run spammers and the shouters.  In other words,
the people whose practices you, Blizzard, say are prohibited.   It is
time to walk the talk Blizzard.  Put up or be shut up.
