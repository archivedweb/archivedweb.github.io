<pre>Greetings,

Follwing this post I am reposting Alignment.  The reason is simple.  
As I stated some posts back, Ordo Rosae Moriatur is a guild with a 
story and that story has a beginning, middle, and... an end.  The end 
of the first story of Ordo Rosae Moriatur is on the horizon.

A large number of veterans (from way back in January and February) as 
well as others have noted with a sense of concern that Diablo is 
growing old and wearing thin.  We have had a slight resurgence with 
increased story telling but it is not enough to stave off the 
inevitable.  Until the expansion or sequel, alot of us are moving on 
to either Illusia or Ultima Online.

I have a proposition for all of you.  A way for us to say goodbye in 
an extraordinary manner.  A way to leave our mark on B.Net and to 
show these people what this game COULD be.

As all of you know Ordo Rosae Moriatur is a roleplaying guild and 
roleplays online all the time.  A few have even joined us (notably 
Atropos and Lepthana).  I warned them in Character last night that 
the guilds must unite to defeat the forces of Diablo and that time is 
coming soon.

What I would like to do is to set up a night of a massive inter-
guild, inter-channel roleplaying session and then game.  We will 
create the last story &#34;Alignment&#34; (not as it is written but 
instead as it occurs as we create it) and then proceed into Hell/Hell 
runs for our last chance to destroy Diablo and his minions.  I have 
ideas concerning limited ressurrections and ultimately if you die, 
you die.  It's a bit harsh I know, but Ordo is going to do this and 
we would like as many interested people as possible to join us.  Now 
for the kicker.  When all is said and done, we each write the story 
from our character's point of view and post it to Ogden's, and the 
Library of the Order and Red Blaze's Tales of Tristram.  It will be 
our good-bye.  The end of our story so that the new players can then 
forge ahead with their own tales and their own way to defeat Diablo.

If you are interested please email me.  If you are a guild master 
please tell me.  

So far the following have expressed an Interest:

Ordo Rosae Moriatur veterans
Atropos and Lepthana of Snakegod
Shannow of Tarot

I personally can't think of a better way to go than with an epic tale.

I hope you can see it.  Remember a few things, Alignment is a vision 
not fact.  It is a preview as to what the intentions are.  Not what 
the events will be.  Also, this will be occurring in a couple of 
weeks.  Be prepared to meet with me and make plans concerning how it 
will be conducted.  I will set up a special web page for this just so 
we can keep track of what is going on.

Take care and please contact me.

Lady Frylia Wintersbreath
Mistress of Ordo Rosae Moriatur</pre>
