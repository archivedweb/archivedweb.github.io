&#62; Well, this bug is quite dumb but I will just say it anyways.  One day 
&#62; i was fooling around with my equipment and got a strange idea of 
&#62; filling the town with gold.(because i was so bored) I started to 
&#62; place 1 gold piece in every square. But after the 126th piece, I was 
&#62; not able to drop anymore pieces. Darn. Anyways, if thats the case, 
&#62; when i am going to duel someone in the church, is it possible to drop 
&#62; like 126 gold pieces on the ground so I won't lose anything? I know 
&#62; it will take a long time but it will ensure you that you won't get 
&#62; monster killed and you won't even lose an ear.  Anyone? Respond 
&#62; please!  


About the only thing that bug is good for is to piss off other 
players.  One of my members, Canada a legit level 42 mage asked to 
see my armour which was a saintly plate of giants.  I un-equiped it & 
tried to put it on the ground.....no luck  

At this point Canada was laughing his ass off & I knew something was 
up.  However, I had a much bigger problem....my inventory was full & 
I couldn't equip my plate without a str ring & I couldn't drop the 
armour :(  Arrrgggghhhhhh

So now I'm stuck in the middle of town with my plate hanging in mid 
air that I can't release nor equip.....damn you Can & your crazy 
ideas!
He had filled up the town with mana potions behind the caves 
therefore I couldn't drop that plate.
