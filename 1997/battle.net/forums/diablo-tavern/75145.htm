<pre>  On Sat May 31 21:35, Puzzlebox wrote:
&#62; I went to the channel of the &#34;Order of the Lost&#34; today in 
&#62; hopes of perhaps having a sensible discussion with them. I read that 
&#62; Ishap, their leader, allegedly has a graduate education and I 
&#62; therefore hoped (in vain, as it turns out) that he might be capable 
&#62; of reasoned argument.
&#62; 
&#62; I went in with Puzzlebox and, since I wanted this to be above-board, 
&#62; I introduced myself as a member of Inferno. I then sat through the 
&#62; standard accusations of how Inferno cheats, etc. I asked them to turn 
&#62; D-eye on me. They (rather smugly) informed me that they had already 
&#62; done so, and stated that they thought my stats were a bit high. Mind 
&#62; you, Puzz is a level 38 Sorcerer with Dreamflange, a Thinking Cap 
&#62; (dur 21), two pieces of heavens jewelry  and a Serpents Ring of 
&#62; Titans, so my stats are indeed pretty good (their bases are maxed 
&#62; too, after all those potions I bought). All of these items were found 
&#62; by me personally, with the exception of the TC, which I got from a 
&#62; friend at dur 1. Perhaps they have so little experience with legit 
&#62; characters that they are unaware of what is possible for a powerful 
&#62; character to have.
&#62; 
&#62; Be that as it may, I rather patiently tried to explain to them that 
&#62; Inferno does not cheat (nor does it &#34;condone&#34; it ...). I 
&#62; explained that we have had problems with cheating members and, 
&#62; whenever possible, we have tried to throw cheaters out.
&#62; 
&#62; What they then revealed was that they really dont care about 
&#62; cheating at all. All three members who were present admitted to using 
&#62; cheats &#34;when necessary&#34;  which to my mind goes quite a bit 
&#62; beyond even Ishaps dictionarys definition of &#34;condone&#34;. 
&#62; They are simply virulently anti-PK. In fact, one of their members 
&#62; made the rather amusing argument that &#34;We cheat to protect the 
&#62; non-cheaters&#34;. Im afraid that they rather conveniently ignored 
&#62; my point that if you kill someone with a hacked character you are ... 
&#62; a cheater PK. 
&#62; 
&#62; At the end of this rather useless conversation I asked if they knew 
&#62; why Elijah was so angry at being accused of cheating. Ignoring the 
&#62; standard taunts, I said, &#34;He lost ALL of his characters last 
&#62; week. Did he go get dupes? NO. Did he hack his levels or bump up his 
&#62; stats? NO. He started over ...&#34;. To this one of the Order jeered, 
&#62; &#34;As a cheater!&#34; After rather tartly instructing this 
&#62; individual to refer back to what I just said, I just shrugged and 
&#62; left. 
&#62; 
&#62; These people are obviously so wrapped up in their own little 
&#62; prejudices that they cannot understand simple declarative sentences. 
&#62; Sad, really. And disappointing. If they were legit it would have been 
&#62; fun dodging them. I was also hoping for a little more intelligence, 
&#62; like I found in a recent conversation with Lepthana explaining why I 
&#62; would never join Snakegod.
&#62; 
&#62; Verdict: just another cheating guild, albeit one with a pretty 
&#62; nauseating streak of self-righteousness. It is destined to dry up and 
&#62; blow away in a month, just like all the rest. There is no need to pay 
&#62; it any further attention.

&#62; 
&#62; P.S. I related some of this to BLZ in chat and he went to their 
&#62; channel as FUZZY_BUNNY. One of them screamed &#34;Its that bunny 
&#62; guy!&#34; and he was immediately banned. Somehow I don't think that 
&#62; speaks well of their courage ...</pre>
