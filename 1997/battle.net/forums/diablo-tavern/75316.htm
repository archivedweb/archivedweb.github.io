&#62; Can't you guys see?  TheMan has a history of being bad.  He cloned, 
&#62; banned, and cheated in the past.  Then he gets a leadership position 
&#62; in INFERNO.  He now abuses his power to create havoc!  He is doing 
&#62; this on purpose folks!  TheMan, I think, is trying to bring INFENRO 
&#62; down!  Why can't anyone see this?  
&#62; Look at poor acidic_overdose.  May God bless his soul.  This guy 
&#62; became my friend and I am sorry to see him go.  I feel the major 
&#62; force behind his resignation is TheMan's constant whining about 
&#62; cheaters online in the B.net.  If it wasn't for this idiot we all 
&#62; would still be a happy little PK guild.  I want the old days back!
&#62; 
&#62; DOWN WITH THEMAN!    
&#62; 
&#62; DOWN WITH THEMAN!
&#62; 
&#62; DOWN WITH THEMAN!
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. In defense of myself I will say that I am no longer a member of 
&#62; INFENRO and I don't really want to ever be a member till the pile of 
&#62; @#@# TheMan is kicked out! 


Sir.Ving, you said, and I quote, &#34;...there is nothing wrong with 
occasional cheaters.&#34;

I do not care about power.  I have what you can call &#34;power.&#34; 
 But I a team player.  I do all I do for INFERNO.  And you are not 
going to do a damn thing to me. So, sign my petition up there and be 
a REAL person, not one of my fans.

I do not care who hates me.  I can always go back to real life.  

Acidic is my friend, and I WILL be mailing him about this.  Until 
then, just be a good boy and shut up, Sir.VingUpDeath.

I have no conflict with you, Sir.Ving, nor do I have time.

And, why do you thinking whining about cheaters does anything?  My, 
do you cheat? Wait, don't answer that, I know.

I do not care what anyone thinks about me. I respect INFERNO, I am 
loyal to INFERNO, and I am going to try and get adicic to come back.

And you, Sir.Ving, cannot do anything to me.  What power do you have?

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

P.S.  Kind of hard to quit INFERNO when we kicked you out, Sir.Ving.  
I am not going anywhere.  Try me.</pre>
