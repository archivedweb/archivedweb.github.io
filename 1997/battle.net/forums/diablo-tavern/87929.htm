<pre>Of Beginnings
Part Two

	“This is my Son!”
	Thrak Na’Fessa paced slowly around Oltor, seemingly studying the 
ground as he walked. His hands were clasped firmly behind his back as 
he turned to regard his new slave, eyeing the outlander with 
distaste. “You will train him in the arts of a Warrior, White Devil. 
And be warned, should any-” He paused reflectively “-undue harm come 
to him, you will pay dearly. The unused stable in the western 
courtyard will serve as your training room until a better suited one 
may be constructed. That is all.” Receiving no response but a bowed 
head, he made for the door.

	As the rotund merchant left the room, Oltor regarded the foreigner 
with interest. His dark hair was roughly cropped, as though hacked 
short with a knife, and the bronze skin of his muscular limbs was 
crisscrossed with many fine lines, old scars from many battles. The 
eyes were green, a deep sea green that betrayed nothing.
	The gladiator looked Oltor up and down briefly, and smiled. Had it 
reached the eyes, such a smile might have been reassuring - but this 
was simply a baring of teeth. Oltor resisted the urge to step away, 
and cleared his throat.
	“Do you have any name other than ‘White Devil’?” he inquired softly. 
The warrior looked at him sharply, a calculating gaze that revealed a 
frightening intelligence. A servant led the pair in the direction of 
the temporary training room. It had been cleared, and a couple of 
stands had been set up, complete with a variety of bladed and non-
bladed weapons.
	“That is the first question I have been asked since I entered the 
arena for the first time.” he replied finally. “I am called Ofiir.”
	Oltor swallowed hard. “I do not want to be a warrior.”
	The gladiator’s grin was more friendly now.
	“I did not want to be a slave. Now, the first thing you have to 
learn,”
	The young man listened attentively, if reluctantly. Suddenly, the 
warrior lashed out with one leg, sweeping Oltor’s feet from beneath 
him. The lad dropped awkwardly, and lay too winded to move. 	The 
gladiator sighed in pity. “is how to fall.”

	It was a long and hard day - The White Devil knew seemingly endless 
ways to either throw you from your feet or trip you with your own, 
and he demonstrated all of them. By sundown, Oltor was tired, 
bruised, sore, and aching in every part of his body - but he was 
falling instinctively, rolling on his shoulder and coming naturally 
back to his feet.
	Although he had been dreading his first day of training, he had 
gained a small sense of achievement with his mastery of this simple 
technique. Tomorrow, promised the gladiator, they would find the 
perfect weapon for him. Oltor shuddered at the thought.
	Intending to muse over some of his tomes on the arcane, his true 
passion, Oltor settled in his chair and began to read. Minutes later, 
he was fast asleep, weariness carrying him beyond even the land of 
dreams.

	The next day as he stumbled into the converted stable, rubbing sleep 
from his eyes, he was bowled from his feet by a buffet to the back of 
the head. Rolling, he stood up once more, wincing as the beginnings 
of a headache throbbed in his ears. He spun to find the barbarian 
standing by the door, watching him carefully.
	“What was that for?” Oltor was outraged
	“Do not expect your enemy to warn you before he attacks. And do not 
think he will wait for you to awaken either. That aside, you have 
passed your first test. You rolled adequately, even weary and 
unprepared. That is good” Somewhat mollified, Oltor rubbed gingerly 
at the back of his head. He felt like he had been kicked by a horse.
	“Now - let me see your hands.”
	Surprised, the young man held out his delicate hands, palm up. Ofiir 
took them in his own callused palms. “Hmmm. This is a problem. You do 
not have enough strength in them to properly wield a sword of any 
great size. Axes are out of the question...” The green-eyed warrior 
cast about the makeshift training room. The two racks were full of 
swords, axes and maces. The gladiator shook his head in disgust. 
“None of these will do. You would either tire too quickly, or not be 
able to put enough strength behind the blow.”
	His roving eyes lit upon a simple broom, leant against the doorway. 
“Ah!” he strode across the chamber and snatched it up, hefting it for 
weight and flexibility. Nodding, he rested the brush end on the floor 
and snapped it off with his heel, leaving a shaft of about nine 
handspans in length.
	“Young master, you will learn to wield the staff. It’s reach will 
complement your height - you will be taller than I in a few months, 
unless I miss my guess - and it’s length will add considerable force 
to your blows” He turned to look at the dark-skinned young man, who 
was smiling openly. “I am happy to learn the staff, Ofiir,” he 
replied. “but please - do not call me ‘young master’ - there is only 
one in this house who is master, and it is not I.”
	“Very well, Oltor. Now, we begin...”

Thankyou for your time, friends. I hope you continue to follow me in 
my journey through my own past. These chapters will soon join my 
other tales in my own library, but I felt I should share them with my 
friends in the Tavern first. By all means, post your comments below 
if you feel the inclination.
