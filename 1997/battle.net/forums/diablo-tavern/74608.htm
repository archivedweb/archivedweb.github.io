<pre>i have bene playing since january 10th, a day i stayed up until 1 am 
playing this game with a friend of mine called jason, who went by the 
name belgarion. we had fun, he took me into his clan, and i played 
with them for about a month and a half.

clan BELL, a lossely based group (i like to still call them a clan) 
made up of honorable players who were true terrors at the game. the 
leader, sonikboom was the best dueler on B-net..he was, and still is, 
even if he doesnt play anymore.

well, after clan bell split up,i played public games. i was lucky, i 
never got PK-ed..mainly because of two things:

1: i always named my games evil, disgusting things like: 
   A:kai's den of blood
   B:bloody stump of kai
   C:kai's dark romance

2:whenever someone entered who looked more powerful then me, i would 
start babbling on about death and vampires and such....ohh boy, one 
rogue wouldnt go near me :-)

it worked, until the cheats started surfacing...then i was PK-ed by 
some super-mage called radagast. he waited till i was in hell/caves 
(i was level 36..he was a mage..level 31) and as a bunch of pig 
demons surrounded me, he lobbed fireballs at me, trying to MK me. the 
poor deluded youth wasn't good, because i didnt lose my items, he 
failed, and only got my ear. i simply restarted and said, and i 
quote, &#34;wow..i still have my stuff, thats cool&#34;
he got mad and left.

anyway, it wasnt until that last week of febuary that i found 
salmissra. i had become well known for my writing, but had recently 
stopped due to the fact that i thought people didnt like 
them.salmissra met me in the town square public channel and convinced 
me to sart again.

we met on several occasions after that, and a few days later, around 
the 3rd of march, i asked to join her group.she promptly introduced 
me to the only memebers..sparhawk,spellstormer,katerchen, and 
ramses.we got along just fine, and by the end of the day, they took 
me in as a member.i then dropped all my ill-gotten goods (traded for 
dupes..yes, i KNEW they were dupes...but i cleansed...) and sword my 
charatcer to snakegod.

my aptitude for gaurding salmissra and my playing skill earned me my 
rank soon after, and i was accepted as one of the few, but proud, 
leaders.

as for excalibur, clan bell, and the short lived LOD who tried to 
recruit me as their captain, i have since forgottten them. i do wish 
i could gather clan bell back, bu thats impossible now.

i was about to give up on b net back in late febuary...but it was 
snakegod..and my friend, slamissra, that saved me from leaving.
