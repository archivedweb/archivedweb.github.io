<pre>	I just wanted to thank all those who have taken the time to read my 
current series I've been working on (Enigma Rising and Exile.) I 
really cannot say how much I appreciate the support (and even the 
criticism.) I also would like to send many thanks to the many 
talented writters who have been sharing their tales with the rest of 
us. You all have made the Tavern a much more enjoyable and unique 
place to drop by. I am extremely pleased to see more writters and 
stories appear here at the Tavern. I wish that I could respond to 
each individual tale but two posts every two hours does have it's 
limitations. I have been responding to some of you via email when I 
have run out of posts and for those of you who have not recieved an 
email or posted reply from me I'm not ignoring you. It's all a matter 
of finding the time to reply to each story. Believe it or not but I 
have been reading every tale that has graced the Tavern and they are 
all incredible. 

	There has been a wide range of topics and characters included in the 
wonderful epics and shorter stories. I would have liked to have 
listed them all here but the list would never end and I just could 
not decide on which ones to include and exclude. 

	Again to all writters out there keep up the magnificent work and 
thank you again for sharing you richly vivid imaginations. 

	To all readers I cannot thank you enough for your support. 
Hmmmm.....I guess my only means of showing my gratitude is by 
writting more stories. An interesting, never-ending circle....
