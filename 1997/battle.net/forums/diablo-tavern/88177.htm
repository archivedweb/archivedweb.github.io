&#62; So I was playing with this other warrior today, and we cleared the 
&#62; caves without to much trouble so we decided to try hell.  Along the 
&#62; way I had found some plate armor (no bonuses, but hey, plate) and I 
&#62; had a sheild, sword, and helm of the moon.  So we go into hell and I 
&#62; cast a portal right away in case we had to bail ... good plan right?  
&#62; Wrong!  The first group of monsters (some kind of drakes)hit me so 
&#62; fast and hard that I didn't even have time to quit before I was dead. 
&#62;  The game picked the worst time to lag and that didn't help.  Oh 
&#62; well, back to the catacombs to get some new stuff and some money to 
&#62; upgrade my equipment.  Found a cool rouge to team up with: Thanks 
&#62; Godess, I especially appreciate the ring.  So now I have some lame-
&#62; ass studded leather and a sheild of fast block.  At least I found a 
&#62; good war hammer to replace the claymore which was all I could afford 
&#62; at the time.  Anyway I learned a valuable lesson, hell is a LONG step 
&#62; up from the caves ... maybe next time I'll get some revenge.  Kinda 
&#62; long, sorry about that ...
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Again, thanks Godess!

I feel your pain man, i remember when i just reached level 17, and 
thought i could handle hell because i reached that level, well i had 
some painful memories of that let me tell you..........i don't think 
it was as bad as yours, since i was playing alone in a private game 
(doh!)......but i got beat up pretty bad......but i did learn a 
valuable lesson that i always remember whenever going to hell (right 
now i'm on level 21 with my new character).......the lesson to be 
learned is to always always have a good place to retreat that will 
give you a tatical advantage against your enemies.......play it 
timid.....when you see monsters coming after you, just go back from 
wherever you came from, and let them come to you, it's much easier 
than going full tilt into a room and trying to kill everything in 
your sight......that's what i learned, so goodnight everyone......

MoonLightKnight out......
