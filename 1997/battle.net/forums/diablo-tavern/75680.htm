   Hello,
  Here are some terms you will have to learn. enjoy.
    
 PKilling(Player Killing) is when one player, for any reason, kills   
  another player. When this happens you lose half your gold and your
  ear. It is not cheating in and of itself. Though many cheaters use
  there cheats to Pk.
 MKilling(Monster Killing) is A)when a PK 
'assists'&#60;tracy..eheheh&#62; 
  the monsters into to killing you or B) they Pk you, get monsters, 
  resurrect you and let the monsters finish you. This is also not    
cheating, although is it kinda mean.
 TK(townkill). A program that allows you to use certain spells in 
  to kill players. A cowards weapon.
 AK(autokill)  A program that kills anyone and everyone in the game.
  A super cowards weapon.
 Res is resurrect.
 Dupes. They consist of items that, through a bug in the game, allows
  you to duplicate and item. Most common dupes are the best weapons   
  and armor in the game.
 Hacks. Any item that is not naturally found in a multiplayer game.
  Common examples of this are Dreamflange Rings. The Dreamflange is 
  a unique mace not a ring or armor or shield or whaterver it has been
  hacked into this week.
 Cheaters. Anyone who uses A)dupes B)hacks C)backup(excluding total 
  system crash) D)Any external program that alters the game to their
  advantage. Commonly refered to as Ishap(VanDarkmoor).
 Guilds(federations). A group of people who have similar ideas on how
  the game should be played and form a group.
 Dots. You get a red dot above your character icon in the chat for 
  killing Diablo on each difficulty level.
 Lag. The most vile demon in Diablo. 
 Latency. Those little bars next to players icons in the chat indicate
  the quality of the connection between you and that person. Green is
  good. Yellow is ehhh. Red is bad. If you get the Plug. It means your
  connection is so bad that you can only chat, but not join games.
 Llama. A) A large furry mammal with a nasty disposition. B) A common
  greeting.
