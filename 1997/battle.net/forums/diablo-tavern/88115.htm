<pre>Ok this is the list of hularious duesl iv'e had. Feel free to add on 
to it :)



Duel #1---&#62; Just when I got onto Bnet. There was a rogue named 
XxX. We decided to duel. I was legit level 24 and she was cheater 
level 25. She asked me what spell to use and I didn't know at the 
time. I walked after and killed her 5 times. After the fifth time she 
asks me : Why isn't this spell working? I say what spell, she says 
StoneCurse hehehe
At the time i didn't know it couldn't be done to players. So after 
she boosted it up to level 255 stone curse, she still couldn't kill 
me. So we resorted to me standing by the animals and she stonecursing 
them to see if it would do both of us :) The times i miss!


Duel #2---&#62; After me getting on to Bnet I had never even known 
about hacks! This was about 3 weeks after i got into Bnet. This game 
had all legit people except one person....that we didn't know had 
cheats. He said he had on like a diablo plate and other hacks like 
that. His HP was around 1000 something. He was a nice cheater 
though..... He killed everything in nm/hell for us so we could get 
our second dot. While he was battling Diablo i came up with the great 
idea to heal him while he was attacking Diablo. He dropped dead!!! 
Later he wanted to duel me....but i knew how to kill him. He just 
couldnt figure out that i was doing heal other at the same time he 
was dropping dead! I miss those days.....</pre>
