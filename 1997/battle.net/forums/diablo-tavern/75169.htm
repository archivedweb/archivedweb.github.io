<pre>Ok, It is true, I have pked newbies this past week.  You think that 
is all I have done?  You stupid son of a beeootcchhh.  I have been 
PKing on battle.net for 4 months.  I've faced challengers and kicked 
their ass from here to kingdom come.  There used to be a high and 
mighty anti-pker who posted here named Mr.Cow..what did I do?  I 
kicked his bitchy lil ass(no offense cow...heheh).  I've had morons 
follow me around begging for duels.  What did I do?  I wasted em. 
Lupo_The_Butcher fits into that category.  I've MKED level 50 morons 
over and over.  There was a time when ASH and I would kill 50 people 
a night like killing skeletons on level 1.  At one point in time I 
was a newbie PK and I collected ears.  I had so many stupid ears the 
only character I had that wasn't a ear storage character was Tracy.  
Since then I have given it up.  I don't care how many ears some punk 
has.  Chances are I had tenfold his ears.  Now, I only have about 10 
ears in my collection and they are of the bad asses who thought they 
could take me down, and a few lame Snakegods ears now, too.  Did I 
ever cheat? Nope.  Did I ever use hacks? Nope.  PKING is easy, you 
just have to know how to do it with STYLE.  I show no mercy for the 
weak.  I MK you, I steal your stupid crap, and odds are I sell the 
junk to Gris.  I don't care about you, in fact, I down right hate 
you.  If you are not INFERNO, you are a target.  Plain and simple.  
Snakegods, don't underestimate me.  Salmissra, I am not Flux.  Not 
only that, your post awhile back describing your fight with flux show 
you have no experience in dueling.  Someone can take damage when they 
are hitting someone else.  It happens, a little thing called lag.  
I've taken damage from people before when the only thing I see is 
them getting hit with my arrows.  Your statement just proved to me 
you are a newbie in the area of fighting another human.  Now, while I 
have had my fun with the newbies, that doesn't mean I won't take down 
the experienced players if I feel like it.  However, to call the 
snakegods experienced??  Hell, newbies are more of a challenge than 
them.  Snakegods are soft and weak.  Like I said before, it isn't 
over yet.  I am not doing this to get attention.  I am doing this 
because I have had it with your WEAK PATHETIC guild.  As far as a war 
goes, I can do this by myself.  Oh, and as for your Shaft6 with all 
his dupes, I know what I saw..

&#34;Duplicate item detected, destroying duplicate.&#34;

Call me a liar if you want, don't bother me, I have been called 
worse.  &#34;All those.. moments.. will be lost... in time...like.. 
tears...in rain.&#34;  Cuda will understand that.  ehehhe.

I'm drunk...go die now.
