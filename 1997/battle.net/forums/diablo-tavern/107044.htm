<pre>This was posted on LaWizards Chatzone by a person named SF. I found 
it very interesting. Maybe you will too.

**********************************************************************

Well.. I was not going to post about this. but it seems I have to. 

A close family member is a well established psychologist, and also a 
part-time player of UO. The character in the game
fits the real person to a T. Goes around and &#34;Intervues&#34; 
Pkers. (after the killing spree, but since this character never
carries anything it doesnt matter.)

This is the results, and I might mention, you should take it 
seriously.

80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.
97&#37; were male
75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
cards taken from parents wallets.
those are hard facts, Gleaned from the PKers themselfs, From 3 
different servers.
These are deductions made from an established psychologist.
ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
paranoia.
80&#37; leaned towards depression. 
70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 
there are other catagories covered, but most fall under the 40 to 20 
percentage, so I wont show them.

What the outcome of this was, That Pkers, as a breed, are making up 
for serious, real life shortcomings by
acting out violent actions in a fantasy world where there is no fear 
of real life retribution. These shortcomings could
stem from anything from a death in the familly to a low self esteem. 
Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
instability, even to the point of needing
mental treatment. Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
feelings through this use of virtual killing.
It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
they feel this release from real life. If they die.. it
means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
again. 

The Internet itself has always tended to be a haven for people with 
severe problems. People can act out
whatever they wish because they feel safe behind the keyboard. 

One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
makes it more costly to perform PK, the
problem will just become greater. 

There are exeptions, however, we did meet a few people who were 
actually &#34;roleplaying&#34; the evil, highway
robber, but most of the people who were pking did it without thinking.

also, important to note, about 15&#37; were pking because in their 
opinion, it was the best way to get more
reagents, when asked why they needed more reagents we were told, to 
cast more spells to get more
reagents. When asked why again, we were told, because, its the only 
way to &#34;win the game&#34;

go figure.

And before you flame me, take a moment to think about it. if you 
still want to flame me, you must be a PKer who felt
this hit a little to close to home.

Good day

Now I don't know how many people this individual actually sampled, 
but I don't find anything above all that suprising.
Do you?

Take care,
