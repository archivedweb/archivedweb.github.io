<pre>I've alwys been a fairly quiet person. I love nature, and hate what 
Mankind has done to it. The human race (IMHO) is the only species on 
this earth truly capable of evil, and we display it every day without 
a care. I often wonder where we are headed, and why we do the things 
we do, but of course, I'm yet another one of the billions who sits 
aside and does nothing. I read novels, play computer games, chat with 
friends about ABSOLUTELY meaningless subjects, and all the while try 
to forget about the problems we create, and the time we waste on 
pointless pusuits. Why do we do nothing when we know we should? That, 
my friend, is something I cannot answer.
    It sickens me that I would like to change so much and yet still I 
ignore it all. Is it a sense of futility, or is it pure laziness? I 
think in many cases it is the latter.
&#60;blindly launches into a story&#62;
    On wednesday night (I work nightshift) we had an injured pigeon 
in our warehouse at work. I made a point of trying to keep it in the 
warmest place I could find, while still giving it the opportunity to 
leave whenever it wanted. (Damn the nights have been cold this week!) 
I gave it water, and food, and was delighted to see it drink from the 
cup in my hand.
    Now... The OTHER guy I worked with this week, whom I have tagged 
&#34;the gimp&#34; for his complete inability to think for himself, 
or do any work without being badgered constantly, talked and joked 
about killing it. Although I am usually a rather tame person, and get 
along easily with everybody, I found myself wondering how much 
satisfaction would be derived by driving his nasal cartilage through 
his brain, and watching him twitch on the floor in his death throes. 
It is a pity that so many of us think so often in a destructive 
manner. In this case, both he and I. I still think I would have liked 
to have done it ( I Dislike the guy with a passion.), but I'd lose my 
job - the job that I need so that I can pay for my car, and keep up 
with the running expenses so I can drive to work every day. Hmm.... 
kinda seems silly now.
Anyway, I've somehow managed to veer of the course somewhat... where 
was I ?
Oh yeah.... I was letting you know that I care too.

Well, I'm off to continue scrolling down this list, then I think I'll 
go and play B.Net for a while.
Perhaps I'll see you there.

Spelling lessons now?  Man... you sound like me, I've been known to 
do that. *grin*</pre>
