<pre>Good evening dear tavern:


I am not sure of the quality of this part
It was rushed out way too quick for my taste,But I always stay true 
to my Poetry
If it was written then it will be read ( I hope)

Also exit King leoric;
I have included a poem that Leoric wrote..

Relax and drink of my words..
and thank you all for giving me the inspiration to create.


&#34;My dreams are no more,
I see not the dancing sun 
nor the sparkles of the stars
Nightmares, evil to the core
I am hounded  and must run
But where? All are fresh scars.
 

All I see are bones 
and kingdom nothing

Chapter 11

Bone Madness.

The flame receded and the madness waited.
Lurking into the fertile dark of his mind
It hissed, it barked, a mad dog hoping to find.
A bone.

&#34;Who am I?&#34; he asked  to the panes frosted
&#34;Not a king nor a man!&#34; just to remind.
&#34; But look at your finger! and tell me how fine.
shines.

Horror entered his soul and it screamed .
And it never stopped, that terrible yell
To this day I still hear it, a touch of hell.
I have seen his madness, it  gleamed 
of crimes.

Where the mortality of his small finger held.
The immortality of bone crackled and led.
Pointing at his sanity, the last shred
 shone

And then! was gone

The last I have seen 
was the scream keen 
into the night
Forever.. 


King of Bones:

Bony fingers pointing weakly away.
From their deseased guilt.
sunken words.
drunken herds.
On the virgin morn, first ray.
Awaken the ivory fleet.
They said we had to be heard.
mute and deaf
it never occured.

At noon, burning brows.
Bloody sows.
Quickly I look back
beyond the torture rack
To hazed visions and shadowy dreams
I stare arrogant and proud.
And what do I see?
Bony fingers, broken words
Trembling at me..

Man it the guy mad or what...

See you all
Morteleux</pre>
