<pre>Mystic my computer is down for at least the rest of the week. I hope 
to be online during the day Saturday for at least a few hours and 
then probably not until Monday night after 7PM PST. (See how I help 
ya track me down? Aren't I considerate prey? Heheh)

Serina (Snakegod) or other. I'm sorry I'm not sure which one I was in 
the game with. If it was you, (Snakegod), please let me know. Either 
way we were in a game together and you mentioned you really liked the 
&#34;Seen...&#34; stories. So I played more publics from that time 
on, like I said in that post, I thought it was funny it all started 
in a channel. 
Also, they did not cheat in the fight, (at least no GM and no Mana 
Lock), They were however all 50th level... so...

The cheaters channel is &#34;Cheaters&#34; White Lotus members reside 
in &#34;White Lotus&#34;... So on and so on...

Does anyone know the Bad Boys Channel name. I need to apologise/talk 
to someone there and I have been unable to find it. If you know it 
please email with the ASCII codes necessary to spell it. 

Thanks in advance,
