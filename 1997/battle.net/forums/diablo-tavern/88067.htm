<pre>Well - I bought Holy Plate Mail from Wirt with my mage when
he was (yes!) level 26.  It was AC 50, +169&#37;, and I can't remember
the exact price off the top of my head - somewhere around
130,000.

I'm sure there are a very few people with legit GPOW.  Blizzard
even posted in the tech support forum, stating that it IS possible
to find it in the dungeon.

Heh - I sure haven't though - and I've been here since day 1.

&#62; Easy, they are BSing.  No one has legit GPOW.  Even a Holy Plate of 
&#62; Whale.  I doubt even Holy Plate exists anymore.  BLZ found some from 
&#62; version 1.0, but things were different back then.  Ok, recently I 
&#62; bought Holy Armor of Whale from Wirt.  It was base armor 12, 
&#62; +164&#37;, and +100 hit points.  Not bad.  It would have been 
&#62; worthwhile if it was Splint Mail.  However, it just Leather.  Price: 
&#62; 64K.  Now, that makes me believe that Splint mail like that does 
&#62; exist, Breastplate, too.  I doubt any other kinds.  Seeing how there 
&#62; are so many combos, I doubt that if it even existed odds are one in 
&#62; billion Wirt would sell it, and if you would even have the gold to 
&#62; buy it.  What some believe is that this stuff came from Single 
&#62; Player.  A lot of hacks/dupes come from there, like butcher cleaver 
&#62; stuff.  If this stuff DID come from single player, I wish Blizzard 
&#62; could make it in the next patch to null that stuff out.  Otherwise, 
&#62; imagine how the game would be if there was no single player to pull 
&#62; that stuff out of...
&#62; 
&#62; Later.
