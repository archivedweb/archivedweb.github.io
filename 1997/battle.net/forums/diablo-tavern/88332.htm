<pre>Ok, so I make a game called Legits only again and again cheaters 
enter. I was so tired of this I deceided to attack. First I test them 
by asking for gpow(can I have gpow?) and they say yes.  So one 
sorceror goes down (he has AAA and a Naj's lightplate indestructble). 
 Then a rogue comes down (with 400 hit points+gpow) and finally a 
warrior (about 500 hitpoints+gpow). So thinking that the biggest 
threat to me is the sorceror I start fireballing (I think I hit him 
about 10 times with his mana shield on) him and he gets pretty 
freaked but doesn't quit or run to town instead he teleports and 
starts to fight me.  I doge his spells, only fireball it seems that 
cheaters think this is the best spell. Then the warrior comes into 
the scene and I cast chain lightning (faster then fireball) on him 
his health drops to 200 but he keeps healing with potions.  The rogue 
doesn't really know whats going on so I leave her alone (or maybe she 
left me alone :) ).  The fighter starts walking toward me and I 
teleport out of there. This goes on for about 2-4 minutes without me 
being hit. I am full health (132) and full mana shield (654) the 
sorceror  hits me with his fireball once and I die, I wish I never 
lost that obsidian plate... So I'm not really upset that I was beaten 
by 3 cheaters, but am still sad that I lost (thinking that maybe I 
could have gotten at least one).  This led me to find out how much 
different dueling is compared to cheater pkilling.  You expect the 
other player to attack you from the start in dueling, but in cheater 
pk your heart beat gets faster, as you right click your cpu slows 
down the game to a halt for a sec and it begins. &#34;So I lost big 
deal&#34; I say to myself, but still am a little pissed that me no 
win.

So I make another game called legits only where I meet a warrior with 
423 (or something like that) health. I ask him if he is a cheater and 
he says no (the others that joined were though). He drops his armour 
and I see its legit.  So I ask him for a priv game and he agrees and 
we are away from all the cheaters.  He wanted to get his third dot so 
we went to Hell/Hell.  The game was great!!! I found a new trick for 
the elemental spell and a great way for legits to kill diablo. I also 
studied my own technique for playin noting when I had the least mana 
in my char and mana potions in my belt (for future hunts).  I died a 
couple of times but I didn't have to worry about him taking my stuff, 
like I said it was great.  We got to laz's room and we knew that we 
would both die if we go in, so we try to lure the baddies out.  I get 
the idea to cast elemental and then turn myself (so that the spell 
turns) to hit the babes. It works after a couple of tries and they 
come out right to my stone curse and his sword. Then laz was no prob. 
I did the same with diablo as well as some knights they chased us and 
we didn't have to worry about those damned mages that are immune to 
fire and lightning. We took care of the knights but he got nailed by 
diablo's apocalypse spell.  I ran a bit to the other side of a wall 
and Diablo chased me then I teleport across (I was on the other side 
now) and am back at my frineds body so I res and I noticed that 
Diablo is probably the smartest of all AI since he goes around the 
wall and starts fighting us again.  Well after about 50 holy bolts 
and a lot more sword slashes diablo is dead. Anyway it was a great 
game and I really felt like I helped him gain the third dot. Which 
proves that Diablo(the game) is not dead and that eventually it might 
come back.
