&#62; I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this world, 
&#62; you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way to this

&#62; looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to have 
&#62; disappointed you.

	Disappointed? I think not. I am more than happy to see a post here 
that causes us to use our mushy grey matter for something worth while 
instead of arguing about when Inferno is going to die and why 
cheaters and pkillers 'suck'. Yes, the human race is indeed a sad one 
(and people wonder why I am incredibly careful about whom I call a 
friend.) I've been pretty disgusted with the world for quite a while. 
We like to think of ourselves as the 'advanced' species on this 
planet. This is ludicrous. My cat and dog get along better than any 
other people I've run into. We have changed very little from the way 
we behaved during the Middle Ages. We still attack each other for no 
apparent reason other than anger we cannot control but should be able 
to. We are still motivated by greed and envy. Is there hope? Yes, 
there is always hope. I used to be constantly depressed by the events 
unfolding on this insane little planet. I do not like to be depressed 
so I stopped concentrating on all of the negative aspects and began 
to look at the positive things in the world. It's kind of like the 
saying: don't concentrate on what you don't have but look at what you 
do have. Well, this beleif has helped me out immensely. I'm still 
aware of the negative aspects of the world but I examine the positive 
aspects just as much. Still, the world is a horrifying place. 

	Who is responsible for the problems of the world? We are. Weather it 
is ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, religious tension in Ireland, or 
murder right on our own streets we are all responsible. It is 
unacceptable for us to merely put these horrible things out of our 
minds simply because they happen 'over there'. The world is no longer 
the vast land it once was. Hmmmm....what's my point.....yes the world 
is in a very sad state and it may seem that our species is heading 
down the sink. Maybe in a million years when we have evolved some 
things may look a little brighter. (If we are still around then.) 
Well, I need to cheer up. I think I'll go kill something (aahh...the 
aggressive human speaks.)
