<pre>&#62; WHO is the Moron The Man?  In your originl post your stupid foot went 
&#62; right into your mouth of BS.  Fact of the matter is you got NO 
&#62; FRICKING CLUE how much exp a legit level 49 gets, cause you were 
&#62; NEVER there.  In your original post you said 10 exp PER MONSTER 10K 
&#62; PER HELL RUN LEVEL 13-16.  Now, I knew this would be your defense.  
&#62; This is called a classic covering of one's ass.  However, I got more 
&#62; news for ya all.  Lets just say that The Man 'made a mistake'.  Wahh. 
&#62;  Ok, now, lets say that in one hour time The Man could get about 1 
&#62; million exp.  To go from level 49-50 you need how much?  Roughly 225 
&#62; million exp.  That is about 225 Hours.  Or Roughly 10 days.  HOWEVER, 
&#62; that is playing straight.  If the man played 8 hours straight a day, 
&#62; every day, it would take him about 28 days to get that EXP.  28 days 
&#62; at 1 million exp per hour, 8 hours a day, 28 days straight.  Now, it 
&#62; took the man no more than 10-14 days.  YOU are the fool the man.  
&#62; Back to playing my game.
&#62; 
&#62; TL

I have a simple question:

Would you PLEASE stop repeating your messages?  I mean, we got your 
first, arrogant, and irrational message when you posted it the first 
time.  Then, you continue to say the same 'offense' every other 
message you type. (hint: you keep calling him an IDIOT for CORRECTING 
himself.  haven't you ever heard that no one is perfect?)  I can 
understand him typing 10 instead of 10k, it's only one character 
loss, but he corrected it and THEN people jump on him.  And for 
everyone ELSE, stop posting messages trying to show off how long you 
sit at your computer figuring how long The Man played Diablo.  YOU 
don't know how long he played because YOU weren't there to watch him; 
so I just suggest that all of you who DON'T know how much exp you get 
at levels 49 and 50 just stay out of this.  I heard someone say that 
THEY got 23k on level 49.  What if The Man got this instead of what 
he noticed he was getting?  Everyone would still argue, no matter, 
just because The Man achieved level 50.  See, no one even cares 
anymore, they just want to flame The Man.. what gives?
