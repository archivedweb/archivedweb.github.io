<pre>Hello everyone! Or, Heaveno, as they would say in Texas...

How is everyone? I fnally got tired of 
Italy...honest!....ok..fine!... I had to leave.... 

Well, now I am at my friend's house in Germany! Germany is a pretty 
interesting country. Do you remember the cartoons made my Japan in 
like the 80s, those that you watched as a kid? Remember the houses in 
the villages? Some of the houses in Germany looks EXACTLY like it! 
They are like the houses that you build from LEGO blocks.

I've heard how fast people drive on highways in Germany, but I just 
had a personal experience yesterday. My friend, my German friend, and 
I were driving on the highways, we were going 130 miles/hour. 
Personally I've only gone up to 120 m/h in the US, but that extra 10 
m/h seems a lot faster, I guess it's because of the trees... Anyway, 
we were chatting, and this car just FLEW by us! I was like OH MY GOD! 
The car was going at least 20 m/p faster than we are, because it 
disappeared into the distance, 150 m'h+?!?! My god! I can't imagin 
what would happing in a head-on collision...yew.

Anyway, I just fixed a problem in the LAN server, and decided to 
catch up on what is happening in Ogden's.

1) Haplo, there is NO WAY AA of Nova can kill a mage in one shot. No 
way. I have a AA of Nova 27 charges, and I have my spells maxed. It 
took me 3 hits standing next to a warrior to kill him, and he only 
had 400+ hp. Distance is what matters in Nova. With MAX resitance, 
Nova does squat if casted 5 inches away from the target, it won't 
even kill MONSTERS in Hell/hell in 1 shot.

2) Tracy & TheMan, did you guys ever duel? TheMan, I wouldn't do it 
if I were you, you don't have a chance. Remember I killed you in a 
duel using only 2 potions? Well, that was the only public game I ever 
saw you in. 

3) Inferno, well, Inferno's fate was sealed by cheaters in the 
federation, and the aboundence of cheaters on B.net. I could decide 
witch was worse. Inferno's flames finally died, leaving behind a 
glorious history, and legendary careers of it's members.

Well, that is all I have to say... Next stop of my trip is Paris, 
Yahoo! I have noticed one thing... some of the women in Europe don't 
shave... well, I guess that is up to personal preference.
