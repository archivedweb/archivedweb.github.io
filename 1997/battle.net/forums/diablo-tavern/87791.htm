-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragnet - Tristram Style

	This is the cit.., er... town, village er..., well you get the idea. 
	The story you are about to read is true, the names have been mangled 
for no reason at all.

	It's Saturday July 12, 2:30 a.m.
	We're working Bunko Division in the Normal Diff game, &#34;Legits 
only!!&#34;.
	My partner's name Gavan, just Gavan.
	The captain is CohenBarbarian.
	My name's Friday, Joe_Friday.

	We'd been sent by the captain to patrol low level games in the hopes 
that we could stop and perhaps eliminate the passing of duped items 
to newbies.
	We had created the game and proceeded to questions the locals.
	I had gotten a little perturbed during our questioning of Cain, the 
so called village elder. All he wanted to do was examine what we were 
carrying.
	&#34;Not a chance bub, this is all police issue and we owe it to the 
citizens to protect police property at all costs!&#34; was my reply. 
He fell silent. I motioned for Gavan to follow me around a nearby 
building. There we saw a small bridge that crossed the stream.
	Now the other side of the stream is not an area of Tristram  to be 
taken lightly. Strange things had been reported to be happening near 
that witch's hut. We walked directly there. I did have to remind 
Gavan not to move his arms while walking. The kid was still new, so I 
corrected him gently.
	Adria, the witch, was cooperative. She stated that she had seen 
dupers around the neighborhood earlier, but they had left before we 
arrived. She gave us descriptions. One was a tall warrior wearing 
full plate, she believed to be GPOW.
	&#34;Obviously duped&#34; she said.
	We nodded in agreement.
	The other was a short Mage wearing robes. The only thing distinctive 
about him was that he had spindly legs. She had not gotten their 
names though.
	&#34;Just like every other Mage in the world&#34; I thought to 
myself.
	&#34;Thank you ma'am&#34; and we moved on.
	As we proceeded to the home of Pepin, the healer, I ask Gavan to 
review what we had.
	&#34;Nothing&#34; he said, and we continued on across Tristram to 
the opulent hut of Mr. Pepin.
	&#34;Just Pepin, no Mr. required&#34; the healer stated.
	&#34;How does a healer afford such a nice hut?&#34; I asked hoping 
to catch him in a lie.
	&#34;Potion sales have been very good.&#34;
	&#34;How's that?&#34; I asked.
	&#34;Everyone needs potions, sergeant&#34; was his slick reply.
	I didn't trust him, but we had nothing to taken him in on so we 
continued the investigation.
	Pepin had mentioned that he believed the mob might be using the peg-
legged boy, Wirt, as front to get rid of stolen merchandise.
	We made a note and traveled directly across the north stream and 
found the boy, Wirt, lurking in a small grove.
	&#34;Psst...&#34; he began.
	&#34;Let's see your business license.&#34; I demanded.
	&#34;Here!&#34; the seemingly innocent looking lad said as he tossed 
me a small piece of parchment. I examined it closely and couldn't 
find anything wrong with it.
	&#34;Let's see you inventory&#34; I said.
	&#34;Cost you 50 gp&#34; replied the boy.
	&#34;Listen kid, we're the police. You'd better cooperate or we'll 
run you in&#34;
	&#34;On what charge, cop!&#34;
	&#34;Selling crap as actually being worthwhile!!&#34;
	That shut him up quickly. He knew I had him. He began to sing like a 
canary. There was duping going all of the time. He reported he had 
seen one warrior dupe a KSOH at least 3 times in one game. He too, 
had not gotten the name. Gavan took down the descriptions of the 
warrior  Wirt had seen duping and we left the grove.
	&#34;Clean up your act, kid, or we'll be back&#34;
	&#34;I'll stop selling garbage and try to offer good items, Sergeant 
Friday, sir&#34; was Wirt's reply.
	We headed south, to a small hut near the entrance to Tristram. There 
we found a dirty, ragged old man sitting outside. We identified 
ourselves.
	In  very slurried speech the man identified himself as Farnham. We 
concluded that Mr. Farnham was inebriated, perhaps beyond reason. He 
was only able to mumble some incoherent story about, Gillian, a 
barmaid at Ogden's Tavern, the local watering hole. He passed out 
before he could tell us anymore.
	&#34;Should we run him in?&#34; Gavan asked.
	&#34;No, let him sleep it off. We have bigger fish to fry!&#34; I 
said and directed Gavan to follow me to Gillian's.
	The comely miss lived in a small uptown hut with her grandmother. 
Tips at Ogden's must be better than I would have thought, from the 
nice furnishing in the hut.
	&#34;A drink officers?&#34; Gillian asked.
	&#34;No thanks ma'am. We're on duty. Just a few questions about 
dupers&#34;
	The statement obviously hit close to home. Her face went white as 
sheet and she lowered her eyes.
	&#34;Something you want to tell us?&#34; I pushed for an answer.
	She broke down sobbing, her head in her hands, tearing streaming 
down her cheeks.
	&#34;I fell for a warrior one night in the tavern. I know it's not 
good to mix business with pleasure, but it happened!&#34; she sobbed 
heavily, &#34;He was so cute and polite. We talked as I worked and 
when I got off he met me. We took a long walk out by the cows and 
through the cemetery. He was so easy to talk to.&#34; She sobbed even 
more and continued.
	&#34;Just the facts, ma'am&#34;
	&#34;I brought  him home for a nightcap. I went into the kitchen and 
when I came back out, oh god, what I saw!!&#34; she had trouble 
choking out the words, &#34;He was duping a GPOA, right there in my 
living room. I screamed for him to leave. He said everyone did it and 
not to overreact. I should go with and not be such a prude. I told 
him to leave!&#34; She broke down complete then.
	&#34;Sorry ma'am it happens&#34; I said.
	&#34;But I could have loved him!&#34; she sobbed.
	We nodded in agreement.
	&#34;You have his name, ma'am?&#34; Gavan asked the distraught woman.
	&#34;Yes, it's      &#34; she managed through the tears.
	I translated that to Omega. &#34;We'll be on the lookout for 
him.&#34;
	&#34;Can't this slime just use regular letters in their names&#34; I 
thought, &#34;Good thing this game doesn't have audio 
capabilities!&#34;
	Our questioning of Gillian had led us to Ogden's, where we were 
headed now.
	As we approached the tavern I noticed, Griswold, the blacksmith, 
standing outside his business. We decided to approach him before 
going to the tavern.
	&#34;Hi, what can I do for you?&#34; was the blacksmith's greeting 
in a suspicious accent.
	&#34;Hmmmm, could he be an illegal alien&#34; I thought to myself.
	We identified ourselves.
	&#34;Have you seen a guy named      ?&#34; I asked hoping to catch 
him off guard.
	&#34;Not for quite a while, officer&#34; he answered.
	&#34;That's sergeant Friday, Mr. Griswold. How long ago was it?&#34;
	&#34;Been a couple a days now&#34; the soot covered man replied, 
&#34;He comes around every few days, trying to push his duped stuff 
on unsuspecting newbies. Ruins my business. Who wants to buy the junk 
I sell if they can have premium items, for nothing.&#34;
	We nodded in agreement.
	&#34;I've almost gone out of business because of pushers like 
him!&#34; the blacksmith said gruffly.
	We nodded in agreement.
	Gavan and I commiserated with him, gave him our cards and headed for 
the Tavern.
	A more wretched hive of .. oops, wrong story.
	This place was filled with all sorts. We could tell we were not 
going to be very popular here.	
	&#34;Anyone smell something?&#34;
	&#34;Who let THEM in here?&#34;
	&#34;It's the fuzz, quiet!!!&#34;
	Those were just some of the comments we heard.
	Ogden the innkeeper was nowhere to be found.
	We attempted to question a few of the patrons, but ran into a stone 
wall. No one would even give us the time of day.
	Finally, we setup a stakeout outside the Tavern.
	Time passes............
	&#34;Joe, we've been in this game for an hour and nobody has joined. 
Can't we just move on to another game?&#34; Gavan ask me as we stood 
just outside Ogden's Tavern.
	Ogden's Tavern, that den of vice and corruption. A hell hole that no 
decent human being would enter! That... Suddenly the game lags, we 
look at the hourglass for about 10 seconds and then the message that 
&#34;Charlie&#34; a level 6 character had joined the game.
	&#34;Greeting&#34; he said.
	&#34;Hello to you&#34; I answered.
	Then the game lagged again.
	Our luck was changing. &#34;     &#34; had joined the game.
	&#34;Hey anyone need a GPOA or GPOW?&#34; he asked immediately.
	&#34;What's that?&#34; Charlie asked innocently.
	&#34;Only the best armor in the game&#34; laughed       obviously 
pleased at finding such a newbie in a game.
	&#34;Oh, how much do you want for it?&#34; the inexperienced Charlie 
asked.
	&#34;It's free, just for you!!&#34; the experienced warrior stated. 
It was clear he hoped to hook this newbie on duped equipment.
	&#34;Ok, if that's ok. It's not cheating or anything is it?&#34; 
Charlie asked.
	&#34;No sir, I found this myself!!!&#34;       stated flatly as he 
felt the hook sink into the newbie's mouth. He then tossed the GPOW 
on the ground near the fountain.
	As Charlie reached for it, Gavan and I rushed from our hiding place. 
Gavan grabbed the plate, being certain not to get his fingerprints on 
it. I grabbed      .
	&#34;You've hooked your last newbie, fellow! I'm taking you in for 
dealing in duped items. You have the right to remain silent, etc, 
etc. Do you understand your rights?&#34;
	&#34;Listen copper, this shouldn't be illegal, after all the game 
allows it!! I'm just providing a service to newbies&#34; the warrior 
said.
	&#34;Okay, fellow, you listen to me. It's scum like you that make 
the discovery of a great item worthless. Every newbie around has the 
best equipment there is. First it's a obsidian ring, then an obsidian 
zodiac amulet, pretty soon they graduate to GPOW or KSOH. They don't 
know how to play. If they get in a game and lose that equipment, 
where will they be? I'll tell you lost, they won't be able to 
continue until they find you or another scumbag like to fix them up 
again. Then the circle continues, until finally they give up because 
it's no fun anymore. Then they go back to Doom or maybe even 
something worse, like UO.&#34; I preached to him hard.
	&#34;Is that what you want? How can you sleep at night knowing 
that's what you're doing? Most people want to play without worry of 
cheats like you, that's where we come in! We sweep the streets of the 
garbage and that's what we're doing here, sweeping the trash up&#34;
	We took       in, knowing full well he'd be back on the streets 
again soon, but at least we had made an impression on Charlie, who 
had sworn to follow the straight and narrow by finding a non-cheating 
guild to join.
	We felt we had succeed in our job for the night.

                                         
...........................................
	On July 15th  a trial was held in the Superior Court of Tristram. 
	We all know the outcome of that trial.
