<pre>   Hi,
 Well yes me a Kraaken tried hopelessly to meet up. I was stuck in 
Cove. Literally. Every time me and my horsey go close to the exit, I 
ended up back 10 feet. Then horesy went bye bye...vanished...oh well.
  I logged back on after the 10 minute downtime. Lag was mucho 
improved. I travelled north and once again met my doom. I was 
watching a big ol' sea serpent when POOF..out of nowhere come this 
ghost. Or something. I thought at first it was a PC now a ghost, but 
then it got naked. Now I have been a ghost and you cant take off your 
little death dress...atleast I can't. Well why I am trying to figure 
out what the hell it is...I get rushed by this big red demonic winged 
satanic latin speaking gargoyle thing....a little lag hits me...and 
when it's over..I am once again amoungst the dead. 
   Well I wandered around for about an hour. No luck on getting res'd.
I saw a WISP attacking a hole graveyard full of SHADES..then I got 
dropped.
   This game is still most definately a BETA. But, it seems to be 
making progress on a daily basis.
   Suggestions for anyone who will be playing soon. When you see a 
big mean looking thing...RUN..unless you have a decent weapon and the 
skill to use it. 
   Now for all those folks who talk about being evil, like me, let me 
tell you. Right now as the game stands just being a thief is damn 
hard. Once you get a rep, noone will buy stuff from you. Leaving you 
with a backpack full of stuff that no merchant will 
buy...errr...trust me on this one...it is no fun. Just from stealing 
stuff, when I enter a town, the guard will often warn me to 
behave...errrr...but it's fun to try to survive.
   Now for those who thought Kraaken's tale of killing a rat was 
funny, trust me, fighting with no fighting skill is worse. A single 
bunny rabbit almost did me in today. YES A BUNNY RABBIT...must of 
been one of FLUFFY_BUNNY's cohorts. I have no fighting skill. Just 
Stealing and Animal Training....I know ...strange but I am just 
trying somethings out.
   Ok, Kraaken, we have to hook up. Maybe we can go kill us a real 
animal...like..a little deer or something!...or we could just stick 
to rats and bunnies. Im sure both of us could take a bunny without 
much trouble. I'll bring the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch. 
&#60;grin&#62;

    nite folks.

 -BLZ_BOB&#34;LLAMA KING&#34;(PoC)-Da Pope on a Rope of Chaos.

ps. I still miss Wildfire...&#60;sob&#62;

&#34;..I'm picking out a thermos for you...&#34;</pre>
