<pre>Well, this was a very interesting thing to referee, to cut it all 
short, I basically made a game, sat in it after clearing lvl 1 and 
checking wirt of course ..then Pyro and Haplo joined for the duel 
that was to be one to remember ...
After a quick chat , I was asked by Pyro to check on something before 
the duel commenced ..something to do with Haplo killing sorceres with 
one casting of nova .. a Arch Angels Staff of Nova is what he used, 
with thinking cap and naj plate being worn too ..so I happily watched 
as I thought to myself about lvl 38 spells and such, the so called 
autokill.
And to my complete dismay, Pyro, whom I know has around 800 or so 
mana (if not more) drops dead after Haplo casts one Nova ring .. well 
this I thought was amazing .. truly wondrous, so after checking 
pyro's resistance I verified he was maxed and I then asked Haplo to 
repeat the procedure .. well I didn't realise that I was hidden 
behind some scenery and he cast again .. and bam, pyro dies .. but 
after realising what had happened I made sure Pyro and I were 
equidistant from Haplo (distance plays a factor with Nova) and asked 
him to cast, now I have 780 mana shield .. and level 20 mana shield, 
and after one casting of nova ..BAM , we both died .. strange to say 
the least ..but I decided to check out this wondrous staff for 
myself, I verified the Haplo's spell + count, it was five, so I put 
on my naj plate, took up his staff and proceeded to fire of rounds of 
Nova .. now Haplo died after 4 hits, not one but four, and I fired at 
least 5 into Pyro and Lionel who had joined also, both of them didn't 
hit the deck.. I took Haplo's death after 4 hits to be due to low 
mana shield resources.

So, as ref for this duel I declared it null and void .. 
In conclusion I have to say that, I believe something was strange, 
but  what exactly was going on I have no idea ..
