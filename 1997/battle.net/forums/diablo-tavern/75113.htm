&#62; Alright, I've heard of guilds before BUT just not in this game.  
&#62; Maybe some of you guys have been playing &#34;Meridian 59&#34; for a 
&#62; bit to long and think, &#34;Must be the same in Diablo!&#34;  From 
&#62; what I have observed in my &#34;cave&#34;, if in fact I have been in 
&#62; one, there is no 
&#62; option to join a guild anywhere in Diablo and that never seemed to be 
&#62; a sort of plan for the game.  If there are Guilds around great, keep 
&#62; it up if ya like, but it just seems hard to be able to keep a group 
&#62; of people together for one reason when 
&#62; &#34;Battle.net&#34; always puts you on a different server.  Very 
&#62; rarely have I had an encounter with a person in the same game, much 
&#62; less in a &#34;Battle.net&#34; chat-room.  I don't know, maybe 
&#62; there's an upgrade putting Guilds in, or maybe I should have read 
&#62; farther than just the first-page of this forum...If there were 
&#62; guilds, why wouldn't they be more publicized.  Ah crap, I'm bored, 
&#62; this kinda sucks...s***, nevermind.

&#62; PRIMUS SUCKS!!

Since you can talk to and play games with people who are on different 
Battle.net servers, you can't really tell what server a person is 
logged on through (and you really have no need to).  Because of that, 
guilds/clans work just fine for Diablo.  They mainly give you a bunch 
of like-minded people to play with.  And no, they are not built into 
the game.  People have been forming them for months, and a few have 
been around since the early days of Battle.net (like Inferno and 
Tarot).

Publicizing guilds is up to the members.  They are each responsible 
for their own recruiting.  Many of the older ones aren't recruiting 
anyway, at least not actively, since they already have many members.
