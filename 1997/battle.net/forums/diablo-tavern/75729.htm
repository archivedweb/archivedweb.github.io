&#62; Well, after my run in with a hunter ({{APOLLO}}), who of course 
&#62; cheated and admitted to it, I was told I had a bounty on my head for 
&#62; the reward of:
&#62; 
&#62; DIABLO'S PLATE!
&#62; 
&#62; After my friend Vlad and I laughed at this for about five minutes, he 
&#62; informed us that he had been hunting me for TWO WEEKS.  
&#62; Unfortunately, he never told me the address for the bounty, or who 
&#62; posted it, although it was likely one of the many dupers I either 
&#62; stole from or MKed.  If you know anything about this bounty, I'd LOVE 
&#62; to know more about it.  Specificly who posted, where, and why.  And 
&#62; come on all you hunters, if you want to kill me for an imaginary 
&#62; reward, I'd LOVE to give you my ear.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;I swear they get stupider by the minute...&#34;

Ah yes.. remember it like it was yesterday.. wait... it was...

He he he... That was one of the more memorable games I have played 
lately.  Lightstryder and I decided to continue our, &#34;Run of 
Terror&#34;... So we created a game called, &#34;Co-op is fun.&#34;  
He he hoo, these two guys showed up.  (((Apollo))) and some other 
schmuck named Mayhem.  Well, Mayhem came down.. we caused alot of 
havoc... brought a whole room full of drakes in on him.. it was only 
nightmare so... I figured.. cause confusion... in this confusion one 
of my stray fireballs struck Mayhem.. and unfortunately, Lightstryder 
as well.  They both were laying in pools of their own blood...

Here is the dialog between Light, Mayhem, and I.

Light: (Mayhem and ((Apollo)))muted):  You've got to stop hitting me!!
Mayhem:  Uh... what happened?
Vlad:  Hmmm.. sorry, went nuts on the fireballs.  I don't have any 
res.

So.. then the moron comes back down... and with Light back up to 
living condition, we kill him again... 3 more times... until he gets 
the point that we are PK's...  Then... (((Apollo))) comes down... and 
of course.. I give him 5 or 6 seconds of the good old LVL 18 
fireball... nothing.  So.. then he pegs me with his super bow...  777 
mana and 91 hit points gone in one or two shots...  I thought.. 
&#34;Hmm... there's one in every game these days.&#34;  So.. he reses 
me.. and I give him the fireball again for good measure.. this time 
prolonged.. 10+seconds... of course.. this did nothing but help my 
self esteem.  So.. the only ear the guy got was mine... 2 of them.  
But hey, it's just a fleshy appendage that is usually attached to my 
head... who needs them anyway.
More dialog:
Lightstryder:  God mode.
Vlad:  Apollo, you really suck, you would have been dead ten times 
over.
(((Apollo))):  I was avengeing Mayhem.
Vlad:  He he hoo... that dosen't really count with the god mode and 
&#34;Super Bow&#34;
Then Light said something that I cannot recall...

(((Apollo))):  Actually I came to get your ear.
Vlad: Me?
Light:  Me?
(((Apollo))):  Lightstryder.
Light:  Wow.. a bounty on little old me.
(((Apollo))):  Yes, but I didn't get your ear.
Vlad:  I have his ear.    :)
(((Apollo))): Give me his ear for yours.
Vlad:  Yeah, right.. big deal, it's just an ear.

So I withheld the offending fleshy appendage that belongs... belonged 
to lightstryder,

Light:  What was the prize?
(((Apollo))): Diablo's plate.

So.. with many laughs at this petty fool for trying to collect a 
bounty on nonexistent equipment, we retired from that game.


Vlad_Demonsbane, the earless PK.

&#34;Ahhhh... rock music would have busted them anyway.&#34;</pre>
