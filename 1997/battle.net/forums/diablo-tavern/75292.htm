<blockquote>
<pre>You have made some valid points, friend Lepthana. It has been
my experience lately that all too often the guests and visitors
to our channel (invited or not - wanted or not) have embarked
upon a campaign to take our channel away from us members either
by driving us away with pointless bickering amongst themselves
or by causing stirring debate on sensitive issues (political,
racial, religeous, etc.) thus creating a poor experience for
those first time guests to the channel who actually want to
learn about our clan.

An example occured recently when I had the OP one particular
afternoon. The channel had several members and guests chatting
and enjoying themselves. Then entered &#34;Flux&#34; (or one of his
alternate characters) and Eugene (specifically &#34;d'Re&#34;). Flux
and Eugene started to bicker about who's character was stronger,
more moral, etc. They were both asked to take it elsewhere by
myself and another member (Ramses I believe). They did not and
continued to bicker, dominating the chat where anyone else
couldn't get a word in. Everyone else left promptly except me,
Flux and Eugene. When asked to take their bickering elsewhere a
second time, I was informed that _I_ was the one who should leave
thereby giving up the OP to them.

I just want to ask all non-members who have a genuine interest in
Clan SnakeGod to bear through all the negative attitudes by others
in the channel and see the positive (often humorous) chat posted
by genuine members. Because we are an open clan and welcome all to
come to our hall, we will inevidably attract an unwanted element.
Of course all are welcome to come, not all are welcome to stay.
Most importantly, if you are in question of who is SnakeGod and 
who isn't, you can ask. Many members who post here at Ogden's place
our clan name after their name. You can ask any of those members
if someone else is a member. We will gladly tell you.
