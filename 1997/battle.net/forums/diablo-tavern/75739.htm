<pre>    Hello,
  To who ever is moderating the chat at this time.
    I am glad to see Mike O posting here. Although I am sorry that 
this forum had to become this much of a mess before it happened.I 
think if you guys who actually post here from time to time, some of 
these folks would twice before posting some of this stuff. I know you 
all are busy doing your regular jobs, but I think a the BLizzard blue
on this forum would do some good.
    Well TGS and Talon/SR were banned, yes. But they both will be 
back tomorrow. They both have some little program that will let them 
back in. So then what? DO you continue to ban them or are they then 
off the hook?
    I think you folks a  Blizzard should have someone check this 
forum over the weekend too. I mean, those rape posts were there for a 
long time, and everytime I came back here I was reminded of the 
content.
    I know you folks can't babysit this place full time. But, I think
a part time nanny would sure do a hell of alot of good.
    Well with that said....thanx for a great game...whens that last 
patch comin' out?&#60;grin&#62;
                   -BLZ_BOB&#34;LLAMA KING&#34;

ps BLIZZARD : FLUFFY_BUNNY says &#34;WORSHIP ME!!!! OR PERISH BY MY 
HAND!&#34;</pre>
