<pre>Greetings friends,
     This is not a surprise at all.  I also found that many of the 
PKer's who are also members of some online message community such as 
our beloved Ogden's, will then run out and post thier kills on the 
message board in an attempt to gain more attention.  We've all seen 
it many times here.
     Another thing that I thought would be usefull is a list of known 
PK groups.  I can only speak of the groups that infest the northern 
part of the mainland on the GL server.  This area covers from Britain 
up to Yew and over to Vesper and Minoc.  The main PK groups that I 
know of covering that area are:

TOC:  Members ot TOC all wear red, usually a dark shade of that 
color.  They travel in groups of 4-8 and most are master warriors, 
swordsman, or mages.  We think the membership is about 8-10 at best.  
My friends in the Yew Rangers, who have a small but growing player 
buit village at the crossroads to Yew were attacked by 8 members of 
TOC.  The battle was short and brutal.  Needless to say the 4 members 
of the Yew Rangers there, most blacksmiths and a couple of archers,  
were torn apart and looted.  Watch out for the TOC, they are tough.  

The Dark Crudasers:  Much like TOC, the Dark Crusaders wear red and 
are masters to grandmasters in their fields.  In reality, I believe 
the Dark Crusaders and the TOC are one in the same.

The Evil Lord Blade and Co.:  This dude is an amateur.  While he is 
an expert swordsman, he has no magic capabilities and due to our 
frequent encounters, he rarely has good equipment :)  Sometimes 
though, he does have a few friends and that complicates the fight.  
But he is easily singled out in the battle and when he falls, his 
buds high tail it.  Even with that, this guy did get me once when I 
was escorting players from Yew to Vesper. 

     With that said, I have a question for Snakegod / ORM / and Tarot 
members.  Where are you all?  I know many of you are in UO but where 
and what are your names in that universe.  You can post a reply or e-
mail me but please, let me know.  I'd like to get together with you 
all.

Safe Journeys,
Valena</pre>
