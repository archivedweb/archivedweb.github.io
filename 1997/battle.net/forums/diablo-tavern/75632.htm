<pre>UPDATE:  The Wife Bug normally co-existing with the system known at 
varying times as either Arlaquin or Discordia (and a secret name in 
the game of Real Llife) has been gone since Saturday afternoon.  
Routine system diagnostics revealed that the Bug somehow managed to 
log on to Air France and upload itself to the city of Florence in the 
country of Italy.  A trace was promptly run, and it seems that the 
Bug managed to hide itself behind two files named Summer School V1.0 
and Printmaking V4122 to disguise it's intent to leave the country.  
The host system, needless to say, was caught completely by surprise.  
Oh, many different notices were sent by the Wife Bug of its impending 
departure, but the system did not anticipate the catastrophic effects 
on some of the installed programs that would be generated by removing 
the Bug from the system.

First, the system is unable to enter sleep mode for more than a 
couple of hours at a time.  I may have to resort to mucking around 
with CMOS (Counting Many Ovines for Sleep) as a means to rectify this 
problem.  Second, Meal Preparation V1.2 seems to only result in 
microwaved dinners and bowls of cereal.  Third, a side effect of the 
previous quirk, Friends Coming Over V5.4 is completely inoperative 
without a fully-functioning Meal Preparation program (hey, my cooking 
isn't THAT bad, is it?).  Fourth, Housecleaning V2.53b still cleans 
dishes and dusts around the computer, but not much else.  And 
finally, Sexual Relations V1.0 has stopped fuinctioning completely.  
In addition, it seems the Wife Bug managed to assign itself a large 
amount of system cache before its departure, claiming things like 
&#34;Art Supplies&#34; and &#34;Museum Fees&#34; were needed to 
enable Summer School V1.0 and Printmaking V4122 to operate properly.

But all is not doom and gloom.  Diablo V1.03 no longer has to compete 
with either Civilization V2.0 or Hoyle! V1.0 for playtime.  Also, 
Housepet V3.0 seems to enjoy the system better without the Wife Bug, 
and even purred when fed this morning.  

Between us, however, I'd much rather have the Bug back.  If you 
encounter me either in Diablo or in the game of Real Life and find me 
to be acting somewhat out of sorts, you now know the cause.

Doesn't love make us behave in the strangest ways? :)
