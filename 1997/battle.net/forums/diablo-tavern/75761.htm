<blockquote>
<pre>Until just 3 days ago, I was a member of one of Inferno's divisions, 
the Hell Knights Player Killer clan.
I have become totally sickend with Inferno, they Lie to there 
members, they care so little that they won't even type out members 
names
Mainly because they only have 50-60 real members, and only a few of 
those are active.
When on there Clan page, they say they have 400 members, NO clan has 
even 200 member let alone 400.
If your a member or thinking about joining Inferno, I suggest that 
you check out Hysteria first.

I Have founded Hysteria, basicly because Inferno is going to fail 
horribly in Ulitma Online.  They have no communication.  They lie to 
there own members, and that is a recipe for disater.  

Hysteria will have a very unique communication system, I have never 
see any other guild with a comm system like this.
We now have 28 members, As far as I can see, there is only 1 active 
member in the Hell Knights division left, 7-8 active members from the 
Hell Knights division of Inferno have joined Hysteria, Does that tell 
you something?

Check us out, you will be plesently surprised, it is a Kick Ass Site, 
and a Kick Ass Clan.

KILLER CLAN&#60;/A&#62;&#60;/CENTER&#62;

Unity, Communication & Devotion will be the keys to our success.
