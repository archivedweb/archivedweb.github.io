<pre>I have browsed recent post and see several on pking. My question is 
this:

WHERE ARE THE LEGIT PKERS? WHERE?

It seems there are a surplus of pkers who can't play worth a crap and 
therefore must use cheats to gain an advantage. Some cheat because co-
ops are cheating which is even worse (co-op peope----CMON! This game 
IS NOT that hard! Don't give me that &#34;my limited online time 
bullshit&#34;)

I remember playing public games in January. I personally like to play 
co-op, but with public games you always have to watch your back 
(exciting to me). I was in the church with my rogue on one occasion, 
plucking away at Fallen Ones alongside a warrior. The warrior was 
apparently was bored with Fallen Ones and decided he wanted a piece 
of me without even a word..... But I must admit I had killer legs :)

But it was 2 normal characters in battle.  No &#34;special&#34; 
software, no KSOH, GPOW(indest.), etc. I had to defend myself against 
a &#34;bandit&#34; (reference to a previous excellent post). That was 
fun. I like co-op, he liked pk, he attacked me, I won. Heheh. No 
complaints here! :)

I have also been killed as well. And for only the mere thrill. No 
gold or ear was taken. Oh well, better find better stuff I thought to 
myself...so that next time I'll have his ear!

So much for that aspect of the game. :(

Oh well, it was fun. Happy bnetting,
Gorn</pre>
