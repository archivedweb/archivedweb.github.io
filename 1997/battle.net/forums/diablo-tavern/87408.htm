<pre>Hello my friends,
	For the past couple days I have been creeping up on level 40.  Last 
night I got myself within 500,000 experience points, but I couldn't 
bring myself to get the level.  I sat around pondering life, thinking 
about how long I had been in my thirties…  
	You see, in 6 months I have never made level 40 with any of my 
characters. 
	Then I woke up this morning at the crack of noon, feeling good to be 
alive.  I logged onto ICQ, and chatted for a couple hours.  Then I 
got a message from none other than the big snake herself,  SALMISSRA. 
	We hadn't chatted in a couple months, so we naturally got talking 
about old times, and I casually mentioned that I was on the brink of 
level 40.  So we decided to start a game, name Level 40 (never can 
remember how to spell forty, always want to add a 'u' in there, 
thought that would be safer, but I digress), I forget the Password.
	I joined, and went down to hell and, as I always do when with a 
pretty Rogue, I started showing off my nifty spells.  Teleporting 
into a room, and chain lightning until everything is dead, waiting 
for her to say &#34;OOOHHHH, AAAHHHH, OOOOOOOOO&#34; as she watches 
the fireworks.  Unfortunately, my ego has always been a bit bigger 
than my mana shield, and I died not five minutes later.
	It is very hard to keep up a macho attitude when you are lying on 
the floor whimpering and asking for a res, trust me. I have had a lot 
of experience at that. I restarted in town, on the guise of needing 
mana, but really because I didn't want to look like an idiot sitting 
on that floor while she killed all the monsters.
	I recovered quickly, and said I had done it on purpose, because I 
wanted to try to make level 40 naked.  How's that for quick thinking? 
 So I collected all the stuff that would fit in my inventory, and 
left the rest where my body was.
	Then I kept teleporting around and killing stuff.  I don't know why, 
but I have always had luck when I am playing naked.  Perhaps it is 
because I am a lot more timid when I know I can't handle more than a 
few hits from the nightmare beasts.  Anyhow, I did a lot better than 
I had done before.
	Soon I got my level, and I didn't even notice it.  I just saw my 
mana go up, right after I had pressed a potion… and thought it was 
lag.  Then I noticed that when I said something it said -=|)elfontes=-
 level 40!  I was very excited, and had saved my ego with that naked 
part.  :)
	I went back to get my stuff and get dressed, then went with Sal to 
kill Laz.  We didn't find anything good, but it is never a total loss 
when you get a level out of it. 

                                                                      
      ~Fin~

-=|)elfontes=-    	level 40 Sorcerer.
Lestat                 	level 32 Rogue
Jordash		Level 28 Warrior

P.S. I think I have found a cure for this boring co-op play.  I was 
playing with a friend later in the day, and I am trying to do 
something that I have not done in my entire career on b.net.  Yup, -
=|)elfontes=- is petitioning to join a guild.  Watch out, the 
pkilling days of my youth might soon return. :)
More to come on that one, unless I am not accepted, in which case you 
can ignore what I just said. </pre>
