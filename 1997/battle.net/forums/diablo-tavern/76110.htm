Hey Kai,

First off, I'd like to point out that takeing items from
anyone COULD mean you end up with a dupe. This is the main
reason I have never take anything from anyone with my chars.
the following is just the stuff I thought was really good

Now on to the fun stuff that I have found in my travels,
the following is just the stuff I thought was really good:
my 1st Mage who is no longer in service
Obsidian amulet of the Zodiac - +32&#37; res. +18 all
lazzy gave me this and I about shit when I id'd it.
Royal Circlet - lazzy again

Silencer: lvl 33 rogue
weird bow of the heavens - 1-6 long bow, +93&#37; tohit +14 all
bought this one from wirt.
Gold Ring of sorcery +30&#37; tohit, +12 magic
nightmare cats
Gold ring of the wolf +21&#37; tohit, +43? HP's
nightmare cats
Saintly plate - full plate base AC74 +118&#37; armor
bought from gris
obsidian helm of the stars +37 resist +10 all atts
normal hell- unique azure drake
ring of the heavens + 14 all
weird sword of haste - +92&#37; tohit, 6-15 sword

Sunbane: lvl 32 mage
this guy finds more uniques than any char I've had. I've only
had him for about a month and I've found more uniques than with
all my other chars. Of course only 2 were worth keeping
but... . here goes
Holy defender
Grandfather
Kings staff of sorcery - 5-10 staff,dont remember the +tohit or +dam, 
but it was +18 to magic. It got eaten by the black death bug
Kings staff of Inferno - same as above, eaten by the Black death 
bug...
Ring of wizardry + 27 magic
ring of the titans + 29 str (need it to wear my plate :)
Amulet of the heavens - +15 all
blessed plate - Gothic plate - base AC 44

I was going through hell/cats, getting exp so I left my staves in 
town along with about 50,000 gold ( I use the sword and shield when I 
am clearing Hell/church or hell/cats) and I ran into some black 
deaths. As soon as one hit me, Diablo crashed and I lost it all!

I have seen wirt selling one godly item- Godly rags
I have seen him selling one holy item - holy skull cap

I have found the best stuff from doing what I like to call
lazzy runs in normal diff.

Actually I find the best stuff when I mk somebody, but I always
take as much as I can carry, start a passworded game, dump them on
the ground and leave.
