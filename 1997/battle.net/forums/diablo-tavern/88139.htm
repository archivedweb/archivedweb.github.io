&#62; Wiseman, and others (I guess),

&#62; The unusual thing about your post, Wiseman, was that the first 
&#62; thought that came to my mind was home.
&#62; 
&#62; Not too many of you probably know too much about Cincinnati, OH, or 
&#62; even more specifically, Clifton.  The University of Cincinnati, where 
&#62; I'm currently going to school, sits right in the middle of Clifton.  
&#62; To sum it up, Clifton is a hole.  I hope I didn't offend anybody.  
&#62; But I walk 4 or 5 city blocks to campus, walking over broken glass, 
&#62; ducking under tree branches, watching out for the part of the 
&#62; sidewalk that has been missing for as long as I've lived here, wave 
&#62; to the colored elderly man that always sits on his porch, nod to the 
&#62; lady on the porch next to his as I look past the Christmas lights 
&#62; still decorating the house, and walk down the hill to campus....  
&#62; 
&#62; ...a campus that is currently just a big wooden wall with bulldozers 
&#62; and whatnot dragging dust everywhere.  The entire campus has about as 
&#62; many trees as I have fingers and toes.  All and all the campus is an 
&#62; eye sore.
&#62; 
&#62; I could write a five hundred page book about the ignorance of UC, 
&#62; from the library that was built with out accounting for the weight of 
&#62; the books to the pastel colored architecture building without a right 
&#62; angle anywhere in it.  But I will not.
&#62; 
&#62; Day in and day out this kind of thing gets old, so I fill the old 
&#62; tank up with gas and embark on my 120 mile treck to the small town of 
&#62; Coldwater, OH every once in a while.  I take old 75 north a ways and 
&#62; turn when I think I'm in the middle of nowhere, and a half an hour 
&#62; later I'm there.  
&#62; 
&#62; Well, what the hell is out there?  Nothing.  It's great.  There is no 
&#62; pollution, no traffic, no maniac psycho triple lane changers, and no 
&#62; crime save the under age drinkers (and we have a bunch of those).  
&#62; Everyone needs to go to these places once in a while, and when these 
&#62; places don't exist anymore, we use our military power capable of 
&#62; blowing up the world twenty times over, and punch out the old time 
&#62; clock.
&#62; 
&#62; And my contribution to all of this will be a drop in an ocean of 
&#62; technology that will eventually turn us all into Gods, or die trying. 
&#62;  Either way, we lose.  I'm not being negative about this, it is just 
&#62; that dying doesn't appear to be too much fun, and having the power to 
&#62; call ourselves God doesn't seem to exciting to me. &#60;yawn&#62;
&#62; 
&#62; I'll tell you this:  In just about everything we do all the fun is 
&#62; getting there.  So whatever ends up happening to us, death or 
&#62; immortality or both, the idea is to get the most out of this crazy 
&#62; parade.
&#62; 
&#62; Now back to my regularly scheduled bit rearrangement....
&#62;

Hello Fellow Cincinnatian,
       Yes Clifton is hole but I have had tons of fun there....can't 
beat the college life....I would do it all over again. The state of 
the world is grim. Alot of times we feel that we cant do much....but 
you can. The little things really matter......when you donate a 
little bit of clothes it helps alot....when you donate a little 
freetime to inner city kids.....it means alot. Thier are millions of 
us &#34;little&#34; people and if we all do a little and can make a 
BIG difference...dont give up on bettering your existance.....If we 
all do the little things change will happen. It's gonna get worse 
before it gets better. Dont vote for Congress or President....VOTE 
where it matters....VOTE for local elections...this is where we have 
to change...we have to start close to home.....then we can change the 
Government(a whole other issue). Sorry for rambling....
Later
SAM HAIN
