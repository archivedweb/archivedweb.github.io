&#62; This is my response to Tracy_Lords, aka Faust, who delivered a 
&#62; hurtful post against me and several of my clansmates, on May 31st. I 
&#62; realize that this should have been posted much sooner, but I was not 
&#62; aware of her accusatory post until a day ago. I would like to clear a 
&#62; few things up that she presented, and blow off some steam.
&#62;  First, I am a member of Snakegod. Though I only have been for a few 
&#62; weeks, this does in no way effect my adherence to the strict code of 
&#62; honor my clan keeps. I am not a cheater; I do not dupe, I do not 
&#62; hack, and I do not pk.
&#62;  During chat, I met a mage named Faust, who said that she needed some 
&#62; decent armor. I agreed to help her in a nightmare game, to look for 
&#62; it. We went down to hell in a private game, and I blindly charged 
&#62; into a pack of maelstrom types. I was defeated. Now, this is where 
&#62; Tracy's and my record of the facts takes a turn. When I fell, it was 
&#62; a regular, legal, normal mk. She did not help me die in any way, no 

Actually I helped with a couple fireballs, that I shot right next to 
you.  The burst helped with the damage.

&#62; matter how much she would like to think so. However, she was correct 
&#62; in stating that &#34;A duplicate item has been detected.&#34; 
&#62; However, these were not the obsid. zodiac rings that she posted 
&#62; about. These were my two identical, legit, dungeon-found, cobalt 


WRONG.  They were obsid zods.  When it was over, there was one obsid 
zod ring, and one obsid zod amulet laying on the ground, along with 
crappy plate, and a holy helm of the whale.  I may be a pk, but I am 
not a liar.

&#62; rings of wizardry. (It is possible, I've evidenced, to find identical 
&#62; jewelry out of the dungeon.) 
&#62; 
&#62; --I'd also like to clear up a point. I do use backup. This was in my 
&#62; petition when I joined snakegod, so this is not a secret I'm keeping. 
&#62; To be clear, I do not consider what I do with it cheating. I consider 
&#62; it cheating when a player backs up his character, and then restores 
&#62; him everytime he dies. Regular old monster kills are normal; without 
&#62; ordinary mk, there would be no game, just click, click, click. The 
&#62; way I use backup is not to restore my guy so I dont have to hunt for 
&#62; equipment again if I die, its for unnatural circumstances. If my 
&#62; second wizardry ring hadn't been destroyed, I would have had no 
&#62; problem going back down and recovering my armor and goods easily, as 
&#62; I died near the steps, and Faust was there to protect. So, instead of 
&#62; losing a rare ring, I used my backup. (unfortunately, my last backup 
&#62; was before i found my ring, so i have a lion ring now) Other non-
&#62; cheating uses for this are to restore your character after a pk/mk, 
&#62; what Tracy tried on Lepthana, or for hardware crashes. 
&#62; 
&#62; After I came back down, Tracy's story is accurate in that she pk'ed 
&#62; me, lied about it, and put one over on the nice guy that I am.
&#62;  In Lord Judicator's pk, I think Tracy was just trying to pump up her 
&#62; oversized ego. After I left the first game, I had lost my dot for 


Talk to him again.  Once he got wasted by my lightning, and he died 
again when you killed him at Laz.

&#62; some reason. Lord Judicator was dotless as well, so Faust and I 
&#62; agreed to baby-sit him through hell, and to get my dot back, and one 
&#62; for him. In hell, she claims that she had pked him with chain 
&#62; lightning. However, according to Jud, the only time he was killed was 
&#62; when he walked into my arrow line between myself and Lazarus,(I res'd 
&#62; him after all was clear) and when he and I met up with some steel 
&#62; lords that I couldnt keep away from him. I also, had been helping Jud 
&#62; nearly the whole game, and I had never seen him killed, except for 
&#62; above, either. 
&#62; 
&#62; In Tracy's post, people were BELIEVING her. Some were coming up with 
&#62; excuses for me(thanks guys, but not necessary) about how I hadnt been 
&#62; a snake for very long, or about how they didnt think I was yet. One, 
&#62; just ONE, person thought that Tracy was just inflating herself with a 
&#62; fake story. 


Sorry, that is what happened.  You had obsid zods, Lord died 3 times, 
once by my lightning, once with your arrow, and another time in 
Diablo's lair.

&#62; 
&#62; --Another point on the trustworthiness of Tracy_Lords. She is a co-op 
&#62; pk. Think about what that means. She comes into games on a rarely 
&#62; seen name, and asks for help. Once in the dungeon, she kills her 
&#62; 'helpers.' These are people that have offered to help a seemingly 
&#62; struggling character, and look at their payment. She lies to helpful 
&#62; people in order to win a 30 gold ear. She doesnt give any warning 
&#62; before attacking, either; I, the helper, came down the stairs to 
&#62; greet an array of fireballs. There is no skill involved in this, and 
&#62; it is a lowdown, dirty, sneaky way to kill someone.
&#62; 
&#62; Tracy brags about pking me. So? I am a level 27 rogue. Her rogue is 
&#62; at level 40, and her mage, Faust, is level 35. Either one of these 
&#62; could have easily killed me after giving me a warning, or in a duel, 
&#62; and she could have gotten her pk honorably. want to win some Snakegod 
&#62; ears? Duel us. If she wants to tote around my ear for a while, let 
&#62; her. There are hundreds, thousands of others on battlenet that could 
&#62; kill me, and they could at least do it honorably.

this wasn't about you.  This is just cause you are snakegod.  If I 
had acted like a PK from the start, there is no way I would have been 
able to get Lep into a game later.  Oh, and he is level 40, any my 
lvl 34 mage killed him.  See, this was a game to me.  One I played 
very well.  I pked you and Lord while acting nice, which later 
allowed me to get Lep into a game to get another prize.


&#62; 
&#62; I can't believe that anyone would possibly believe the word of this 
&#62; deceitful co-op pker against the known honor of the Snakegod clan. 
&#62; Tracy, you put not only yourself to shame, but your entire clan as 
&#62; well.

AHAHHAHA.  I don't always PK like that, but sometimes you gotta do 
what you gotta do..kill the little fish to get to the bigger fish.  
In your case that big fish was Lep.  You were just tasty apetizer.  
Put us to shame though?  HA!  I pked 3 Snakegods who are basically 
cowards and never play in public games.  It took a lot of bsing on my 
part to get into you guys, but hey, it worked.  And son, you are a 
LIAR.  You had obsiz zods.  Sigh.  Why lie?  Just confess yer sins 
and ask for forgiveness from yer Queen...who I will get sooner or 
later.
