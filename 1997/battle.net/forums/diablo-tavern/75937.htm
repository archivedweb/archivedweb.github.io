<blockquote>
<pre>This is my response to Tracy_Lords, aka Faust, who delivered a 
hurtful post against me and several of my clansmates, on May 31st. I 
realize that this should have been posted much sooner, but I was not 
aware of her accusatory post until a day ago. I would like to clear a 
few things up that she presented, and blow off some steam.
 First, I am a member of Snakegod. Though I only have been for a few 
weeks, this does in no way effect my adherence to the strict code of 
honor my clan keeps. I am not a cheater; I do not dupe, I do not 
hack, and I do not pk.
 During chat, I met a mage named Faust, who said that she needed some 
decent armor. I agreed to help her in a nightmare game, to look for 
it. We went down to hell in a private game, and I blindly charged 
into a pack of maelstrom types. I was defeated. Now, this is where 
Tracy's and my record of the facts takes a turn. When I fell, it was 
a regular, legal, normal mk. She did not help me die in any way, no 
matter how much she would like to think so. However, she was correct 
in stating that &#34;A duplicate item has been detected.&#34; 
However, these were not the obsid. zodiac rings that she posted 
about. These were my two identical, legit, dungeon-found, cobalt 
rings of wizardry. (It is possible, I've evidenced, to find identical 
jewelry out of the dungeon.) 

--I'd also like to clear up a point. I do use backup. This was in my 
petition when I joined snakegod, so this is not a secret I'm keeping. 
To be clear, I do not consider what I do with it cheating. I consider 
it cheating when a player backs up his character, and then restores 
him everytime he dies. Regular old monster kills are normal; without 
ordinary mk, there would be no game, just click, click, click. The 
way I use backup is not to restore my guy so I dont have to hunt for 
equipment again if I die, its for unnatural circumstances. If my 
second wizardry ring hadn't been destroyed, I would have had no 
problem going back down and recovering my armor and goods easily, as 
I died near the steps, and Faust was there to protect. So, instead of 
losing a rare ring, I used my backup. (unfortunately, my last backup 
was before i found my ring, so i have a lion ring now) Other non-
cheating uses for this are to restore your character after a pk/mk, 
what Tracy tried on Lepthana, or for hardware crashes. 

After I came back down, Tracy's story is accurate in that she pk'ed 
me, lied about it, and put one over on the nice guy that I am.
 In Lord Judicator's pk, I think Tracy was just trying to pump up her 
oversized ego. After I left the first game, I had lost my dot for 
some reason. Lord Judicator was dotless as well, so Faust and I 
agreed to baby-sit him through hell, and to get my dot back, and one 
for him. In hell, she claims that she had pked him with chain 
lightning. However, according to Jud, the only time he was killed was 
when he walked into my arrow line between myself and Lazarus,(I res'd 
him after all was clear) and when he and I met up with some steel 
lords that I couldnt keep away from him. I also, had been helping Jud 
nearly the whole game, and I had never seen him killed, except for 
above, either. 

In Tracy's post, people were BELIEVING her. Some were coming up with 
excuses for me(thanks guys, but not necessary) about how I hadnt been 
a snake for very long, or about how they didnt think I was yet. One, 
just ONE, person thought that Tracy was just inflating herself with a 
fake story. 

--Another point on the trustworthiness of Tracy_Lords. She is a co-op 
pk. Think about what that means. She comes into games on a rarely 
seen name, and asks for help. Once in the dungeon, she kills her 
'helpers.' These are people that have offered to help a seemingly 
struggling character, and look at their payment. She lies to helpful 
people in order to win a 30 gold ear. She doesnt give any warning 
before attacking, either; I, the helper, came down the stairs to 
greet an array of fireballs. There is no skill involved in this, and 
it is a lowdown, dirty, sneaky way to kill someone.

Tracy brags about pking me. So? I am a level 27 rogue. Her rogue is 
at level 40, and her mage, Faust, is level 35. Either one of these 
could have easily killed me after giving me a warning, or in a duel, 
and she could have gotten her pk honorably. want to win some Snakegod 
ears? Duel us. If she wants to tote around my ear for a while, let 
her. There are hundreds, thousands of others on battlenet that could 
kill me, and they could at least do it honorably.

I can't believe that anyone would possibly believe the word of this 
deceitful co-op pker against the known honor of the Snakegod clan. 
Tracy, you put not only yourself to shame, but your entire clan as 
well.
