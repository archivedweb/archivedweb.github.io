<pre>Tales of the White Wolf — Chapter Eight

	Justin's mind was so clouded, and he couldn't even seem to move his 
hands up to rub his eyes. He blinked a few times and was able to 
bring some of his surroundings into focus. Why was he lying in small 
dimly lit cave? How had he gotten there?
	The blackouts were getting much worse and lasting much longer the 
elf thought. He concentrated hard to remember what he could.
	The last thing he could recall was running from the tavern in 
Moonridge after the brawl with the Black Deaths. He had involved some 
young human warrior and now didn't know where the warrior was or what 
his fate had been. This was not like him. He had become something of 
a hot head, a far cry from the even tempered young elf his father 
often tried to provoke.
	He now wondered if these lapses of memory and the horrific dreams, 
no nightmares, he had been having of late were somehow responsible 
for his behavior. Had his mind somehow become infected by the vile 
events that occurred just over a year ago? Was this way of dealing 
with the tremendous loss he had suffered? All of these thoughts 
careened about in his mind as he tried to collect his thoughts and 
bring himself to full consciousness.
	He, fortunately for one so young, remembered almost nothing of the 
night. The night when his world had been shattered and he had been 
unable to prevent the event. He often pondered about his loss of 
memory, if it was a loss. Perhaps what had occurred and he had seen, 
was so frightening and evil that he had forced the memories from his 
mind. He was slowly losing the battle for wakefulness and the dream 
was beginning.
	Don't think about! Don't let it into your mind! Don't allow the 
nightmare to happen again! He fought and fought, but the need to 
sleep outdid his desire to awaken. &#34;How much more of this can I 
take?&#34; was the final cognizant thought he had before sleep came.
	A deep sleep, no cares, life was good. Justin had just returned from 
a wonderful hunting trip with his father, Gregor, prince of the High 
Elf kingdom of Skillar. The young elf had proved himself very worthy 
his day. His skills with the bow had begun to rival those of Allon, 
his father's personal guard. Allon was known throughout the kingdom 
as the greatest bowman to ever live. If one believed the rumors, the 
great Elven archer could pick an ant off of an apple at more than one 
hundred yards. Under Allon's sharp eye, young Justin had become very 
adept at the use of the bow.
	He sat at the dinner table, Jaal, his great white wolf, at his side 
beaming as Gregor recounted the story of their day's hunting. 
Cassandra, Justin's mother, listened intently. Justin knew she 
disliked the killing of animals even if for food, but she did manage 
to show pride in her son's achievement. Being the only child of the 
prince placed a great burden on the young one to excel. He had always 
been up to the challenge and his parents were the first to praise his 
accomplishments. 
	They ate and talked for hours that night. Finally, they retired, 
happy and content. Justin had to force himself to sleep, the 
excitement of day was waning slowly for him. As sleep enveloped him, 
he dreamed of great deeds and adventures, the dreams of a young Elven 
prince.
	A chilling scream shattered the peaceful serenity of his dreams.
	&#34;Mother&#34; he thought as he struggled to awaken.
	He jumped from his cot and burst from his room into the hallway. He 
could see the door to his parent's room standing open and light 
streaming from within. Another scream, this more painful than the 
first, came from the lit room. Justin rushed to the door. He couldn't 
believe his eyes. There on the floor beside his parent's cot, lay his 
father, blood covering him, face down. His mother was still on the 
cot, but two men in dark clothing had her by the arms. A third man, 
with his back to Justin, raised a club above his head and brought it 
down upon the head of the Elven princess. She screamed once more and 
fell limply to the cot. Justin stood immobile of what seemed to be an 
eternity. In that split second the three men turned and started 
across the room toward him.
	Realizing the danger, Justin turned to flee. He was too late. One of 
the thugs caught him across the back of his head with a club. The 
room then began to swirl about him, as if a great fog had entered it. 
He fell against the wall near the door, unable to move or see 
clearly, but also unable to lose consciousness. His mind just clouded 
over and he remained paralyzed, unable to act.
	&#34;Justin, wake up, boy!&#34; the voice of Allon floated into 
Justin's thoughts. &#34;Come on, we need to move you quickly!&#34;
	Allon helped the boy to his feet and raise his arm upon his broad 
shoulders. They moved through the door before Justin had a chance to 
see what had happened. What he didn't see were the bodies of three 
men, two appeared to be common thugs, while the third obviously was a 
man of magic. All three though, had multiple arrows protruding from 
their bodies and were dead. Also, two other bodies lay in the room, 
an Elven prince and his beautiful princess. Their lifeless forms 
lying side by side next to their cot, her arms stretched out across 
the body of her slain mate, holding him for the last time.
	The next few minutes are very unclear to Justin, but when he finally 
began to regain his senses, they were outside the castle. Allon had 
stopped to catch his breath and assay the situation. It was obvious 
that one of the neighboring clans of elves had hired humans to 
assassinate the prince in hopes of gaining control of Skillar and its 
bountiful resources. &#34;I must get the young prince to safety.&#34; 
thought the Elven warrior, &#34;I must protect him, I must do what I 
could not do for his father.&#34;
	&#34;We must find a safe haven, my prince&#34; Allon whispered 
softly.
	&#34;Jaal&#34; Justin cried out.
	Suddenly, Justin was awake again, in this cave. Why in this cave? 
Where am I? When will these nightmares end?
					.....................................

	&#34;Where has that wolf gone?&#34; Rikor thought to himself, 
&#34;Why does he keep vanishing? Is he hunting?&#34; Rikor dismissed 
the thoughts and rolled over allowing sleep to take control.
