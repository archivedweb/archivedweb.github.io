<pre>if  talon was the one that did this, then ban him, but i have
seen absolutely no evidence that it was him yet.  the host
was actually the same one as theman has.  

although talon hates you guys i am not so fast to suspect 
him.  the way i see it, you would have to be a pretty
decent hacker to change your host to something else,
and from the posts of talon that i have read, he doesn't
seem like he is past the 3rd grade yet.

it also seems that the writing style of these posts are not 
the same as talon.  have you read any of talon's posts?
he can't even speak english!  the real talon makes a lot
of simple gramatical errors, things which are not present
in this post.  talon has serious problems with his tense
errors, similar to what you might hear from a nonnative
speaker.  although this post has several minor errors,
these errors are not characteristic of talon's writing.


so far, the only evidence i have that this is talon's
writing is the fact that his enemy accused him.  now,
why would his enemy accused him, and try to get him
banned?

i am not saying that talon was not the one who did it,
i am simply not going to join in on this damn witchhunt.
um, i don't know where you all live, but in MY country,
people are innocent until proven guilty. 

i urge you guys to actually try to do some investigation
before you all join in on this great crusade to ban a 
disgusting person.  it seems like you guys read a disgusting
post, and you are out for revenge, even if you get back
at the wrong person.  one guy, who is talon's enemy,
accused it was him, and then EVERYONE assumed he 
was right.  remember, just cuz someone is accused
doesn't mean he did it.

the only piece of evidence i see is the HOST name, and
this piece of evidence actually points towards theman, 
not talon.  i'll assume this can be hacked, but i just don't
think talon seems smart enough to do something like this.
i honestly think that it was done by someone else.   

i don't want to be closed minded about this, so if you
can show me any evidence, please post it or email me.
if i think the evidence is sound, i will add my name
to this petition.
