&#62; A while back someone in the strategy forum posted claiming that he 
&#62; could block four out of five witches' blood stars and half the 
&#62; advocates' fireballs with his shield. He drew a few flames from 
&#62; people saying that this was impossible; occasionally you blocked one, 
&#62; but the cases were few and far between. But intrigued, I decided to 
&#62; do some research.
&#62; 
&#62; First, I noticed that you &#34;dodge&#34; blood stars completely 
&#62; based on your DEX. While standing still, Lepthana would only get hit 
&#62; about half the time- the rest of the time the bloodstars would pass 
&#62; right on by. Increasing/decreasing AC and resists had no effect on 
&#62; this, but I think that putting on +DEX stuff did, though the change 
&#62; between 250 DEX and 330 DEX was hard to determine. Later tests showed 
&#62; that my warrior Thelmonan wouldn't dodge nearly as many, so I'm 
&#62; relatively confident in that asessment.
&#62; 
&#62; Putting a shield on Lept, I first noticed that she didn't block 
&#62; anything. Adding/removing plate and helm had no effect on this. They 
&#62; either missed completely or I took it on the chin. However, when I 
&#62; stripped her of her resistances, suddenly the sheild came alive. She 
&#62; managed to block most of what came her way. Again, AC didn't seem to 
&#62; have an effect.
&#62; 
&#62; Intrigued, I switched to my warrior and his array of shields:
&#62; 
&#62; Stormshield
&#62; Godly shield of the ages (AC 54)
&#62; Emerald shield of the tiger (+50&#37;, +47 HP, AC 14)
&#62; Buckler (AC 1, purchased just for the occasion)
&#62; 
&#62; I first tried the godly shield. Again I noticed that he started 
&#62; blocking blood stars after I stripped him of all his magic resistance 
&#62; and fireballs after all fire resist was gone (note on blocking 
&#62; fireballs: you often end up taking blast damage from them when 
&#62; blocked, though not always, maybe 50&#37; of the time). I then 
&#62; switched to the emerald shield, in the hopes that perhaps with it I 
&#62; could get the resistance and the blocking at the same time- sadly, it 
&#62; was not so. The emerald shield refused to block anything. The buckler 
&#62; did a comperable job to the godly shield, so I'm pretty confident 
&#62; that the AC on the shield doesn't matter. The stormshield did wonders-
&#62;  NOTHING got through while I was standing still. An array of a half 
&#62; dozen witches couldn't touch me- to prove it I walked away from the 
&#62; computer and ate lunch, when I came back I still hadn't been hit. So 
&#62; I was hopeful at this point that I'd discovered something worthwhile.
&#62; 
&#62; However, testing under battle conditions failed miserably. While 
&#62; walking, the shield doesn't seem to block anything at all, and while 
&#62; trying to swing the sword it's terribly disruptive as your shield 
&#62; blocks ten blood stars in a row before you can attack again. The end 
&#62; result was that even the stormshield couldn't knock out enough of 
&#62; them to make it worth not having any resists, making the research 
&#62; somewhat disappointing. 
&#62; 
&#62; However, if you've got low resists (say, &#60; 25&#37;) and use a 
&#62; shield, it might work better to forget the resists and use the shield 
&#62; as your magic defense. Also I haven't tried it out in a player vs. 
&#62; player situation, so I don't know how it'll react to that (if you 
&#62; didn't have the blast damage to worry about, a way to duel mages 
&#62; would be to stand still and let them fireball their mana away!).

What! you did not figure out blast damage!zzz........</pre>
