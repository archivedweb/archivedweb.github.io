&#62; 1.  Never wanted to kill Diablo and get dots, but one day I did.  I 
&#62; was tired of idiots (Enigma sticks in my mind) running cheat programs 
to get dots.

   You OBVIOUSLY do not rea;ize how LONG it takes to actually get to 
level 43. You would need to kill diablo just for the experience. (and 
why was TheMan never at level 42 and below? Didnt feel like logging 
on till then? HAHAHAHAHA... 

&#62; 2.  Hehehehe, Grandfather is VERY accurate when someone knows how to 
&#62; use it.  You need SKILL to kill with a Grandfather (Hence all of PoC 
&#62; can't use it)

Er.. Grandmother sword sucks.. it is terrible. Accurate? Nope..  
Skill? How much skill could possibly get involved in clicking on 
someone??  heh.. you are pretty stupid... 


&#62; 3.  They usually do cheat, and those I do not feel like dueling I 
&#62; decline.  I HAVE lost in duels, and have dueled quite alot.

I do not cheat, Tal doesnt cheat, Anubisan doesnt cheat, Sammy doesnt 
cheat, snow doesnt cheat, luki doesnt cheat, pyro doesnt cheat, 
Nosophorous doesnt cheat...  they all asked for duels... you ran.


&#62; 
&#62; SnowRabbit, you are weak, a nothing, an also-ran, a person who could 
&#62; not cut the mustard.
&#62; 
&#62; You joined PoC because you could not handle INFERNO.

All i can say here is HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  couldnt handle 
being around a bunch of worthless idiots? Right.
&#62; 
&#62; SnowRabbit, you are just some loser.  EVERYONE in INFERNO basically 
&#62; said they hated you, except Naga.  They think YOU, of all people, are 
&#62; the true loser in this.
&#62; 

More BS.

&#62; Anubis, you quit, and you accuse FireBrand of cheating....not nice.

I did?.. uh.. I must have been really drunk... dont remember that at 
all.. 

&#62; 
&#62; If PoC can grow up and talk without insulting 
everything in their 
&#62; wake, they may do well.
&#62; 
&#62; Then again, miracles are hard to come by.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  SnowRabbit, why not answer this question:  why are you a bad PK?
&#62; 
&#62; P.P.S.  If you don't like attitude, quit talking to me.  Besides, 
&#62; SnowRabbit, even half of the PoC think you are just lame.  You were 
&#62; let in to try and get Naga in, but Naga declined.  Tough luck getting 
&#62; used, bud.

HAHAHAHAH... Naga?  We invited Snow because he has SKILL. Naga was 
NEVER invited.  Standard TheMan BS.

                                  Anubis

PS. If you want war, make a game. We will have our own little battle.</pre>
