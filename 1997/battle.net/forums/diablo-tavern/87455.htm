<pre>&#62; And who can tell me what PoC is about? I know some of the members, 
&#62; BLZ, Tracy, Sarco, but I haven't heard from any of em. I obviously am 
&#62; going to have to scroll back a few pages of the tavern and see what's 
&#62; what. Unless someone would like to enlighten me... Please!  O;)

Well, heres my take on things (you'll probably get several different 
takes on PoC depending on who's replying).  PoC is a disenfranchised 
Inferno spin off.  The members did not like what they saw Inferno 
becoming so they left for greener pasture.  In this case what they 
decided on would be a small group of dedicated and experienced 
players.  Hence, when you look at their members roster:
<a href="http://www.slip.net/~dddd/diablo">http://www.slip.net/~dddd/diablo</a>
you'll see only a few (about 15 members), but they are all classic 
players.  Government in PoC is a system of voting, no leadership.

Since PoC's creation, the players left in Inferno have formed the New 
Inferno, but this organization is rife with internal struggle.  (Or 
is that the old Inferno.... almost sounds like there is two groups of 
Inferno these days, Lionel's and Flux/TheMan's.)

Oh well, on a side note.  Glad to see you are interested in the guild 
and should you be accepted, i look forward to co-oping with you.  
Hmm, just don't get any funny ideas :)

later.

ps. remember, this is only my view on the situation, i could be off a 
bit, i am not in either of the guilds but i know most of both guilds 
members.</pre>
