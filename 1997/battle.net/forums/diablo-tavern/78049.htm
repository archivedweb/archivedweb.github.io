&#62; &#62; Well, i've finally come to the conclusion that Diablo sucks.   The 
&#62; &#62; game itself is friggin awesome, but the manner in playing it on 
&#62; &#62; battle.net is the culprit.  Blizzard, forget about starcraft.  You 
&#62; &#62; are creating something that will be a flop.  Log on to battle.net 
&#62; &#62; sometime (if you can actually get on and stay on), look at the number 
&#62; &#62; of people online when you get in a chat channel, and guarantee 
&#62; &#62; yourself that this is the number of people that won't buy starcraft.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There is no way that I or any of my friends will buy another Blizzard 
&#62; &#62; game because of the rampant disregard for your &#34;honest&#34; 
&#62; &#62; customers.  The only answer there is, is to wait for Ultima Online.  
&#62; &#62; When UO comes out, give it a week, then log back on battle.net and 
&#62; &#62; see just how many people are online.  Maybe then, and only then, will 
&#62; &#62; you realize that you made a BIG mistake keeping the character files 
&#62; &#62; on the PC not the server.  I would gladly pay the extra bucks to know 
&#62; &#62; I can play 99.9&#37; cheat free.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; [clipped text not relevant to answer]
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with this. I will not purchase starcraft as I have witnessed 
&#62; and been harrassed by cheaters and hackers. I have to believe that 
&#62; the stand on cheating, hacking and duping in diablo will be brought 
&#62; over into starcraft. I don't mind if someone wants to cheat unless it 
&#62; flows over into my game. This includes when a cheating player comes 
&#62; into my game with an AA apoc staff with 255 charges and then proceeds 
&#62; to kill everything within range not allowing me one experience point. 
&#62; This in my opinion affects my game play. I also will wait for UO

I certainly agree with your sentiments about cheating ruining and 
effecting the quality of enjoyment one can derive from the game.  
Like you, I anxiously awaited the arrival of UO.  I anxiously awaited 
this game until I learned that I would continue to have to pay for 
Ultima's online services.

I concede that that this may be an inevitable evolution as video 
games go online but I am not ready to &#34;Subscribe&#34; to a 
service after paying $40-$60 for a game.

I appreciate that Diablo, for all its faults, provides the online 
service at no extra cost.  I do hope that the programmers at Blizzard 
are able to find ways to provide a quality gaming environment for 
cheaters and non-cheaters alike.

I'm done now.</pre>
