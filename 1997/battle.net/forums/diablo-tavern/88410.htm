&#62; I declare INFERNO officially dead, today, on all days a Friday.
&#62; 
&#62; Look around...no one exists except ONE person..flux-babe.
&#62; 
&#62; Well, flux, you were right..you would be INFERNO to the bitter end.
&#62; 
&#62; INFERNO did not get killed, it did not get slaughtered, it just....it 
&#62; did not even die....it basically was dissolved.
&#62; 
&#62; I really have nothing to say, but I think tonight of all nights 
&#62; should be a night to pay our respects to INFERNO, for once and for 
&#62; all.
&#62; 
&#62; Because no matter WHAT guild was on the forum, they always were 
&#62; involved with INFERNO to some degree.  Many were intrigued, many 
&#62; hated, yet all felt INFERNO whether it was good or bad.
&#62; 
&#62; INFERNO, I bid you a goodbye...UO is coming out, and INFERNO in 
&#62; Diablo and UO does not exist.
&#62; 
&#62; Flux-babe, WHAT list?  There IS no list, never WAS a list, and you 
&#62; &#34;just took email addresses off my in box.&#34;  Sorry, flux, do 
&#62; not try and deny this now...NOTHING can be done.
&#62; 
&#62; INFERNO was, of all things, a nice thing....some hated it, some loved 
&#62; it...it is kind of like seeing a friend die out of nowhere.....
&#62; 
&#62; Well, things are over.  INFERNO, I will miss you.
&#62; 
&#62; So, I dedicate this post to you....to your whole being.
&#62; 
&#62; Nevermind history, cheaters in side, lost duels, wins, good times, 
&#62; INFERNO was INFERNO.  It will always be in memory.
&#62; 
&#62; So, INFERNO, I basically say goodbye to you officially.
&#62; 
&#62; Maybe all of us should pay our respects.

&#62; Of all comments I ever heard of INFERNO, there were so many I heard 
&#62; that were just bad, just good, nice, sweet, terrible, and just all 
&#62; that...but of all the comments, the best one I ever heard came from 
&#62; some little known warrior I met.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;You have to admit, INFERNO has problems, but you guys are the 
&#62; spirit of B.net.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; To that level 6 warrior named Nathan, thanks, little guy.  You summed 
&#62; of INFERNO to a ever-loving T.
&#62; 
&#62; See ya, INFERNO.  Gonna miss you. :)
&#62; 
&#62; The Man
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;A legend is born...and then it dies.  Yet life goes on.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Fee free to add tidbits about INFERNO...input is nice :)

   
    Seeing how TheMan takes the Diablo world as real life, he 
probably cried about this!</pre>
