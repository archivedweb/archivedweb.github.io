&#62; Since everyone in Ogden HATE cheaters (except me), we should have a 
&#62; vote!   I think we should post our votes and concerns about cheaters 
&#62; on the forum, so everyone can see why cheat is bad/wrong/whatever.  I 
&#62; think we should clear this fair RIGHT NOW!  
&#62; 
&#62; We should have a vote against CHEATING.  If you guys have more than 
&#62; 20 votes on this messages, I will shut my mouth about CHEATERs.  But 
&#62; there is one condition, if there is more than 10 vote for cheaters, 
&#62; you lose.  (that counting me on, too)
&#62; 
&#62; Isn't this a great idea???  We can settle this cheater discussion on 
&#62; ogden for good.  
&#62; 
&#62; *Caution for All who want to vote*
&#62; 1.  Remember to put your name and guild name(if you have one.)
&#62; 2.  Please, put some counterattacks for CHEATERS, (NT) doesn'y count 
&#62; for vote.
&#62; 3.  Do not ask about my IQ or my grammar or anything about me, just 
&#62; put your thoughts/belief about cheat, then vote.
&#62; 4.  Do not attack anyone with racial language.  (for:EUGENE)
&#62; --My rules for voting--
&#62; (This is fair, since you can only discuss about cheaters.)
&#62; 
&#62; Here's my example for vote.
&#62; 
&#62; ---CHEATERs MANIFESTO---
&#62; (Vote YES to cheaters)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I believe that cheat is one of your(cheater's) right.  Even Blizzard 
&#62; said that you are allowed to cheat in B.net.  Some may say you are 
&#62; wrong, but you have a right to cheat.  The most people who comlplain 
&#62; about cheat are PKs.  Pkillers are getting mad these days, because 
&#62; they can't kill no more.  
&#62; 
&#62; There is no right or wrong for Pkilling.  Pkilling is just part of 
&#62; the game, even if you cheat to kill others it doesn't matter.  Only 
&#62; thing that people lose will be their ear.  Some say about moral 
&#62; behind the CHEAT, but I believe that moral of PKilling is just the 
&#62; same.  Final results are the same, &#34;You KILL, You Happy!&#34;  :) 
&#62;  There can't be a moral, remember Cheat to kill or not cheat to kill 
&#62; is the same.
&#62; 
&#62; DEFEND YOUR --RIGHT-- to CHEAT!!!  
&#62; Others being legit or non-legit is not your business, the people have 
&#62; right to chose their will.  You can't force them to do things that 
&#62; you want them to do.  Unite, and Down with our RIGHTS.  
&#62; 
&#62; S-R
&#62; 
Cheating is 100&#37; wrong if it affects other people.  Many people 
spent $40-$60 on Diablo and the game is ruined for them by cheats, 
especially if they like to play with new people in public games.  If 
you hack your character please stay in your own private games by 
yourself.
