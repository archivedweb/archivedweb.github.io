<pre>Me and 2 other friend of mine where going onto b.nat to play a game. 
We loged in to b.net and went to the bar, this is our normal rout. 
You are going to need to visualize this to realy get the effect. My 
friend went to make the game and saw that it was already made. 
Thinking I made the game befor him he loged into it. I not knowing he 
did not make the game went into it. We both had starting charicters 
mine 4th his 6th non cheat mages. He got into the game befor I did 
becouse my computer is slower then his. (from here out I am wrighting 
this from my friends view). When he got there there was a person 
standing by the fountin in town (30+ level fighter) he said:&#34;how 
did you get into my privite game?&#34; My friend said &#34;WE are 
hackers&#34; (he said WE even though he did not know if I was on my 
way or not) The guy was standing there throwing items down and we 
think he was duping but we are not sure. At this point they see me 
log in say &#34;We are good&#34; (becouse my computer is slower I saw 
moste of what they where saying even though I was not in the game to 
them yet) My friend later told me he was glad that I saw the start of 
the exchange even though I was not there yet. At this point I could 
see the look on the guys face &#34;OH-SH*T, my stuff is on the ground 
and they are going to TKill me.&#34; At this point I laughing hard 
already, then my friend says &#34;get'em&#34; So I take off running 
after him in the middle of town. He runns away from me and takes off 
around the fountin, with me on his heels. After about 5 sec of 
chasing him around he logs off, crashing the game, we could say ALT-
F4. In this fray I seemed to end up on the floor laughing my head 
off. My level 4 guy walks away some how with a Godly shield of the 
ages and a Thinking cap, 2 of the three items he had on the ground I 
leter sold them. I dont know how I got the items though, I have a 
hard enough time getting things in a normal game by just running past 
them. We used no cheats and forced a level 30+ guy out of his PRIVITE 
game with a level 4 and a level 6 mage in town. Sad to say that is 
would probably never hapen agen. The timing was to good to be true 
for it to work, we could not have planed it out any way.  
&#34;HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAH&#34;</pre>
