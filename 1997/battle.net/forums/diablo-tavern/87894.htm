&#62; WOW!!! I finally logged on!! I swear to GOD, you can get lost in that 
&#62; game. Here's how it went-
&#62; 
&#62; I started with my Neophyte Mage Tyrael at the Wayfarers Inn in 
&#62; Britain. I walked inside, but no one was around. I then started 
&#62; getting familiar with the control. Right button to move, double 
&#62; clicks to activate, left click to look- that type of stuff. First 
&#62; off, the lag really bothered me. Then, I started do get used to it 
&#62; and it started being not that bad. 
&#62; So, I was getting used to the controls, when I decided to look at 
&#62; stuff in my inventory. I gots crap. Just a spell book, clothes and a 
&#62; knife. Didn't even know how to open the damn backpack. I changed my 
&#62; text colour to deep blue. There's a million different colours of text 
&#62; to choose from. So, I was thinking I was king of the hill when I was 
&#62; in fact a big newbie. I ran around Britain for about 20 minutes 
&#62; before I ran into an NPC. Boy, are they stupid. They're good at 
&#62; directions and stuff, but not at small talk.
&#62; Well, I then finally ran into my official first character talking 
&#62; player guy (for lack of a better word). His name was Goshien, and he 
&#62; was a newbie too. We decided to team up and explore around Britain. 
&#62; SO, I started trying to talk to this NPC for directions while he 
&#62; decided to practice his fine art of sitting on his ass. The NPC, 
&#62; after much talking, told me where to go to find Castle British. I 
&#62; thought &#34;Cool, I'll knock boots with the rich and famous!&#34;
&#62; !@#$&#37;^& wouldn't let me in the bloody castle! As much as I tried, 
&#62; they would not let me in. All the gaurds kept saying were &#34;Thou 
&#62; will regret thine actions, swine!&#34; and stuff like that.
&#62; So, denied access to Castle British, me and Goshien started hitting 
&#62; on this gypsy chick called Lydia. Stupid @!@#$ ran off on us. Denied, 
&#62; in a game... how sad....
&#62; But still, the wierdest thing I saw, and I swear to God I'm not 
&#62; making this up, is a talking mushroom.
&#62; Yes, a talking mushroom. He was shouting things off while I sat there 
&#62; and tried to talk to Mushroom Man. Mushrooms are not great 
&#62; conversationalists.
&#62; Well, that's about it. After that I ran around but crashed. So ends 
&#62; part 2 of My Adventures in UO. Tomorrow's an other day...
&#62; 
&#62; Take it easy,
&#62; Tyrael
&#62; I AM THE TIGER
