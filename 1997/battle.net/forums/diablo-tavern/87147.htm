&#62; &#62; &#62;   A few things...  It looks like TheMan is the ONLY one posting on 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the subject, and the only one wanting war..  TheMan?  If we were to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; go to war, what would that change? Would you actually FIGHT any of 
&#62; &#62; &#62; us? HAHAHAHAH...  NO, you wouldnt. War would probly mean us asking 
&#62; &#62; &#62; for duels, people declining because of fear, and everything would go 
&#62; &#62; &#62; back to normal. Couldnt you figure that out?...  So, unless you are 
&#62; &#62; &#62; willing to fight, do not post any crap about war.. it just looks 
&#62; &#62; &#62; silly. (There are at least 5 PoC that no inferno could beat in fair 
&#62; &#62; &#62; fights. NO INFERNO.) 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62;            Anubis
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Why bother even arguing with The Man?  He STILL won't answer 
&#62; &#62; perfectly reasonable questions, like:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; How he got to lvl 43 with out any dots.
&#62; &#62; How he pks people with GPOW with his &#34;GrandMother&#34; sword.
&#62; &#62; Why he calls everyone that offers him a duel a cheat.
&#62; &#62; Why he won't duel Sammy.  (Sam doesn't cheat)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Man is a talker.  Someone that can't back up a word of what they 
&#62; &#62; say.  What he doesn't realize is that he makes himself look dumber 
&#62; &#62; and dumber every time he posts about fighting.  Everyone knows he 
&#62; &#62; just hangs around in INFERNO all day.  He never enters public games.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Man is totally lame.  Good points though Anubis.  Why does he 
&#62; &#62; even talk about war?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; War would just be about 20 of the best pks on b.net vs. The(wo)Man.  
&#62; &#62; (The biggest wimp that ever played Diablo)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Take a guess at who would win.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Later,
&#62; &#62; Tabbir-Wons
&#62; &#62; Animal of Power
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; P.S.  When will you answer my questions The Man?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#34;Why does rabbit have more power than man?&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Never wanted to kill Diablo and get dots, but one day I did.  I 
&#62; was tired of idiots (Enigma sticks in my mind) running cheat programs 
&#62; to get dots.
&#62; 2.  Hehehehe, Grandfather is VERY accurate when someone knows how to 
&#62; use it.  You need SKILL to kill with a Grandfather (Hence all of PoC 
&#62; can't use it)
&#62; 3.  They usually do cheat, and those I do not feel like dueling I 
&#62; decline.  I HAVE lost in duels, and have dueled quite alot.
&#62; 4.  Sam cheats.  Deny it all you want, from what I heard from a few 
&#62; people, he clones people.  Call me a chicken if you want, I REFUSE to 
&#62; have my items made into dupes by some common two-bit cloning pk.
&#62; 
&#62; SnowRabbit, you are weak, a nothing, an also-ran, a person who could 
&#62; not cut the mustard.
&#62; 
&#62; You joined PoC because you could not handle INFERNO.
&#62; 
&#62; SnowRabbit, you are just some loser.  EVERYONE in INFERNO basically 
&#62; said they hated you, except Naga.  They think YOU, of all people, are 
&#62; the true loser in this.
&#62; 
&#62; Anubis, you quit, and you accuse FireBrand of cheating....not nice.
&#62; 
&#62; If PoC can grow up and talk without insulting everything in their 
&#62; wake, they may do well.
&#62; 
&#62; Then again, miracles are hard to come by.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  SnowRabbit, why not answer this question:  why are you a bad PK?
&#62; 
&#62; P.P.S.  If you don't like attitude, quit talking to me.  Besides, 
&#62; SnowRabbit, even half of the PoC think you are just lame.  You were 
&#62; let in to try and get Naga in, but Naga declined.  Tough luck getting 
&#62; used, bud.

errrr...didn't YOU used to clone people?
