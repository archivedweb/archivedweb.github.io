<pre>Arch-Angel-  If you have doubts about starting this new guild, just e-
mail me and tell me you don't want to do it.  I think the name might 
need a little work, but if we did enough advertidsing, it could be 
just as good as some of the others.  I will help you with anything I 
can on the site.  If you want to join another guild, that's fine with 
me.  I can start my own page if it is too much trouble for you.  
Either way, I'll be starting my own guild.  It would be nice to have 
some help, though.  I was in a few guilds, and it was very hard to 
find any of them in the game.  This way, we can arrange times for 
when our guild members can meet.  That is one of the flaws I have 
seen in the current guilds.  I haven't seen any teamwork.  I am not 
talking about all guilds, just the ones I've been in.  Send me the 
site location also.

&#62; sent me a &#34;come check if I belong there&#34; to Making a guild of 
&#62; my own, (I got someone that wants to start a guild with me.) I either 
&#62; will join a Guild or make a Vigilante Guild after PK's (Inferno)So as 
&#62; I go down this Battle ladin path to Tristram I have to choose sides...
&#62; Which one will I choose??
