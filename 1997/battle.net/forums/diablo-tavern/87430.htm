<blockquote>
<pre>Well, I got back yesterday from a 10day vacation in Vt where I had no 
Diablo, so I wasted all of Sunday playing Diablo. I am in the process 
of rebuilding Lok ( he was 38th warrior, shrined, restarted him as a 
mage).

I started at early Sunday morning at level 35 about 5 million out 
from level 36. I didn't have my 3rd dot yet, so I started a hell game 
and played, breaking every barrel, picking up every coin, and 
identifying everything. Levels 13 and 14 cleared fast enough. Level 
15 was snow witches, azure drakes, and soul burners. Yuk. I didn't 
have an apoc staff at the time, so I had to do it the golem/stone 
curse way. It seems that the best way to clear these things is to 
stone curse the triple immune, cast the golem next to it, stone curse 
another and all others. If you get everything stoned, then go whack 
on the one your golem is working on, but your first priority is to go 
immediately stone curse anything that comes out of the spell. I had 
about a level 12 golem and a level 15 stone curse, so it was a 50:50 
chance the golem would kill the witch/advocate prior to the witch 
coming out. It takes me about 9 whacks with my kings sword of 
sorcery. I had started using a kings sword of vampires which got me 
about 3 mana back per blow, but I find the +40 mana from the sorcery 
sword is worth more than the slight recharge of the vamp (for 
warriors, you get back more mana and  your mana pool is smaller so 
vamp is the way to go).

Eventually the level was cleared, then I went on to 16. Yuk. Those 
damned triple immune advocates. Sir Gareth? was in diablo's room. I 
lured Diablo out with holy bolt and trapped him in the maze. Gareth 
dropped a Royal Circlet! I killed Diablo, and Adria offered me a jade 
staff of apoc (too late, witch). I ate lunch with my diablo fix in.

Here is the stuff I have found and kept so far with Lok
Blessed (99&#37;) full plate (73) of precision (17dex)
Royal Circlet (40ac,~40mana, +10 stats, +10&#37; light radius)
Amulet of heavens (14 stats)
garnet ring of heavens
sapphire ring of heavens
Mindcry
jade staff of apoc
Thinking cap (11dur)
Kings sword of Vampires (a claymore)
Kings sword of Sorcery (+20 magic, 3-7 base dmg)
Holy Defender

My resistances are pretty low, but I need all the stats I can get on 
adders to wear the full plate. With sword and shield I am ~200&#37; 
to hit, 220ac, 750mana. I am sitting on the thinking cap until I get 
it up to 21 dur. I had an 11 dur thinking cap destroyed once. Mindcry 
is perhaps my favorite weapon, as it is so much fun using all 69 of 
those guardians (they work wonders on the stormriders now).

After lunch I shrine surfed for a couple hours (IE started up normal 
games, teleported around levels looking for bosses, shrines, and 
books all the way through level 8, then finish with a fast Laz run). 
I really upped my stats and books (2 enchanted shrines) but no hidden 
shrines.

Being bored with that I went on to do a couple nightmare hell games. 
Each game took me about 1hr to clear (gold & barrels taken), and I 
didn't see squat in terms of objects. I am of the opinion you get 
your best objects at character level 29, then its all crap 
thereafter. I netted about 4million xp per run, and way too much 
gold. One run I had 220K gold I had to go waste on object scumming at 
Grizwald (buy the lowest price object, sell it back, look to see if 
the new object is worth a damn, buy the next lowest price object, 
sell it back...). It seems like most of the time it takes to complete 
nightmare hell is the time you waste disposing of gold. Grizwald 
yielded nothing good.

On whim I then decided to compare running hell cats. It took me 30 
minutes to clear hell cats (keep gold, no barrels, no objects except 
uniques + rings) and I got about 5million xp. Hell cats are the way 
to go in your mid 30's (besides that elusive hidden shrine may turn 
up).

I finished last night with all my stats maxed (45str, 250mag, 85dex, 
80 vit). My training plan worked well- I trained magic exclusively 
through until I reached 200 magic, then I switched to training 
vitality exclusively. I maxed out dex on elixirs, and about 4 dungeon 
levels later had maxed out vit on an elixir at character level 36. I 
maxed out books in spell levels 1-2, and only lack elemental books in 
level 3 spells. I finished last night at about 3million out from 
level 37.

It looks like it will be smooth sailing to level 39.
