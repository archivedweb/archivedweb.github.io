&#62; To get to Level 50:  1,310,707,109
&#62; 
&#62; Subtract that, you get roughly 228,700,000 or so.
&#62; 
&#62; that is 228 Million, NOT in the Billions. :)
&#62; 
&#62; Well, two weeks, eight hours a day or so.
&#62; 
&#62; You can make that VERY well.
&#62; 
&#62; And I may only be a warrior, but I do my job well. :)
&#62; 
&#62; So, Tracy, I did not hack my level or use a trainer to cheat.
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry, people who doubted me....do your math all you want.
&#62; 
&#62; Less then 300 Million experience, almost like 200 Million.
&#62; 
&#62; Oh no...I think PoC &#34;tripped up.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; I did not cheat, guys.  It is too bad you know less about the game 
&#62; then you think.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (Legit Level 50)
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Ready to duel, Tracy?&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Ten Pm.  If you cannot show up, I understand, I need to leave 
&#62; soon after that MAYBE.  So show up.  If you want it tomorrow, no 
&#62; problem and I understand.  If you want to go drinking, go ahead.  But 
&#62; we duel before the weekend is over.  
&#62; 
&#62; P.P.S.  Thanks to those who doubted me....but being legit level 50 
&#62; just makes me feel damn good. :)
&#62;

The Man,

In my response to your post below i PROVED that it IS possible to 
gain 200 million exp. in 14 days.  However, i am almost positive that 
you did not.  During that time period i saw you on b.net from 2 to 4 
hours a day (always in chat too).  That i am positive of.  Now...if 
you spend that much time chatting, plus another 8 hours playing 
privately, then that would add up to a total of 12 hours of Diablo in 
one day.  THAT IS 1/2 OF THE ENTIRE DAY!!!  I hope to god that you 
don't play that much.  (Things like sleeping and eating are 
important...exercise!)  No one in their right mind would play Diablo 
that much.  Especially for two weeks straight...

I don't think so The Man.

Later,
Tibbar-Wons
Animal of Knowledge


P.S.  This is The Man's last desperate cry for attention.</pre>
