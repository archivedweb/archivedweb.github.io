&#62; Dear Hysteria members ...
&#62; 
&#62; First, I completely respect the decision made by SpiritWalker, 
&#62; acidic, and Tigerclaw to leave and set up their own shop. There comes 
thanks
&#62; a time in almost everyone's life when they dream of going into 
&#62; business for themselves. Believe me, I know it's a lot more fun 
&#62; calling the shots yourself rather than having to work in a group and 
&#62; compromise. 
&#62; 
&#62; However, I find very unfortunate is that you feel the need to flame 
&#62; your former guild-mates in order to get attention for yourselves.
I put a stop to this last night.  We had a meeting and i told 
everyone that this was stupid... 
&#62; There is absolutely no objective reason why Hysteria and Inferno 
&#62; cannot work together, so long as the desire is there.
I agree.   We are all pkers right?
&#62; Second, I would advise inviting both Anu and TheMan into your ranks 
&#62; only if I had a Machiavellian bent. They both have their plusses, but 
&#62; I dont think you want to see your new guild tear itself apart from 
&#62; within.
We accept anyone who follows the rules of the guild.  If they dont, 
their out, its that simple.
&#62; Third, I think it's rather sad that you have welcomed Cryptorchild 
&#62; into your ranks. This is someone who flamed Inferno and then got all 
&#62; mad when we wouldnt let him in. Now hes full of childish taunts 
&#62; towards Morte, who I think is one of the fairest and most reasonable 
&#62; people around. Cryptor's recent spam posts aren't doing wonders for 
&#62; you image either. You might want to reconsider these personnel 
&#62; decisions, since Id hate for you to become known as the Inferno 
&#62; &#34;B&#34; team.
I for one dont like crypt because of his attacks against morte ( a 
good friend and pker) but we do accept anyone who follows our rules.
&#62; Finally, guilds come and go every day. Inferno has been around for 
&#62; months and has survived every previous prediction of its demise. You 
&#62; might want to keep that in mind before you start burning any bridges 
&#62; behind you.
I am trying to build bridges, not burn em...

thanks for ur suggestions/concerns...
