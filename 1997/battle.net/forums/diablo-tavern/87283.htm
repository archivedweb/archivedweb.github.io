&#62; OK.. about a half of page below, Code Myster posted about &#34;How 
&#62; would it be if there were NO cheats and dupes&#34; Well, he pictured

&#60;WHAAAAAAAAaaAAAaaaAAA&#62; &#60;BRRRrrRRRrrrrrRRRR&#62; 
&#60;POOT&#62;

for those who don't know, that was a chainsaw.... Eugene's posts are 
tooo big for a simple &#60;snip&#62;&#60;snip&#62; ;)

&#62; mana! Those days people KNEW how to play and I would think 3 times 
&#62; before messing with group of 3 adventurers!


I also am an Old Timer Eugene. I started playing Diablo around Jan 
18th and have an account number less of around 70K (yea, like I'm 
gonna tell anyone what it is :). Anyway my post was just intended to 
make people think a little about Diablo and speculate on what might 
have happened if cheating had not existed. 

Everyone can imagine their own senerio but I stick by mine. I was 
PK'd more in the first 2 months of Diablo than in the last 4 months 
combined. Just as their are GodMode PK'ers today, these same people 
would also be into MK'ing for armor. You don't believe it? Heck I 
hear tales in here everyday of some inferno or snakegod who 
&#34;hunts cheaters&#34;, MK's them and sells their armor. They do it 
because they have nothing better to do. Imagine the same people who 
now have a purpose.... upgrade their own stuff. I can easily see my 
senerio as being as valid as yours.

I'm not trying to say your theory is wrong either.... I'm glad you 
posted your view. As this is all speculative anyway, there really 
isn't a &#34;correct&#34; answer.

Later everyone....

PS: I enjoyed all the posts on this.... such a refreshing twist on 
the same ole same ole Tavern chit-chat. </pre>
