<pre>Fun with zip resist and much darkness (long)
by Crystalion (Snakegod)

I have played with darkness and the zero resist shield effect in the 
past but there have been a number of interesting posts on these two 
subjects lately so I thought I'd have some fun combining them.

Usually a post like this would probably go not to Ogden's but to the 
Strategy forum. However this was as much for silliness as science and 
I think you'll be amused at the results, so here goes...

[If you don't care for the science just skip down to &#34;The Fun 
Stuff&#34;]

The background:
==============
Lepthana has been posting about the fact that a shield will block 
some spells *if* you have no resistance to that spell.

Code Mystery [there are some extra symbols in his character name, but 
you'll know him if you see him] has posted recently about how minus 
light radius affects monster activation.

Some facts, as far as I know:
=======================
1) fast block and harmony [fast hit recovery] combined stop multiple 
attacks very well, and single source attacks near perfectly

2) your shield will block: weapons, arrows, and at least the 
following spells: fire bolt, charged bolt, blood star and bone spirit 
[which will deflect off and seek a new target!]. Fireball will be 
blocked but the &#34;splash&#34; damage will still hit you. Inferno, 
flash and lightning don't get blocked, for example. Huge numbers of 
blood stars from multiple witches can easily hit faster than 
block/harmony can stop them.

3) A monster that has not been activated, will activate and try to 
attack you, if you damage but don't kill it. [note that word: 
&#34;damage&#34;--this explains why your guardians don't activate 
monsters that are immune to fire just my shooting at them. It also 
explains why I very much would like to get my hands on a Useless bow -
100&#37; damage of the bear for theoretical experimentation]

4) if your darkness is great enough, your character will isually 
disappear from your screen whenever you walk to the right and/or down.

5) when you have alot of minus light radius [I've played with -
70&#37;, -90&#37; and -100&#37;. More is possible but I can't 
comment] the monsters have no trouble seeing you--once they are 
activated. It turns out that monster activation is done based on 
distance from you and this distance is variable. Initially, when you 
enter a dungeon level this activation distance is related to your 
light radius net. Changes to your light radius while on the level 
really confuse the program code and don't seem to be to your 
advantage.

So, if you come onto a level with a very small light radius then not 
only do you have severe trouble seeing monsters, but they don't 
activate until you are much closer to them than you are used to. If 
you're an invincible near-sighted Bruce Lee type, then this is just 
fine. Otherwise you'll want to use infravision.

While guardians and town portals will illuminate your surrounding it 
will *not* either change how far away you can see monsters nor will 
it change your activation distance. The effect can seem very much as 
if there is that Special monster that grants his followers 
invisibility. Speaking of which, you'd best remember that infravision 
does not allow you to see invisible monsters such as &#34;hidden&#34; 
[and like those just mentioned],


The Fun Stuff:
===========
I have often used stormshield [for fast block] and harmony on 
Crystalion. Playing warrior mage can be fun. I've not used 
Gotterdamerung very much, because without resist Hell is really 
Hellacious when a whole buncha stuff starts shooting spells at you.

But what if only a little bitta stuff got activated at any given 
time, so you never had to cope with very much ranged magic? Then zero 
resist would be okay, almost a feature for its enabling of blocking...

So the most fun equip I tried tonight  was:
================================
Awesome plate for high AC [around 180]
Stormshield for 40 AC and indestructible fastblock
Gotterdamerung for 60 AC, minus 40&#37; light radius, +20 all, zero 
resists
zod amu +20 all
zod ring +20 all
harmony ring
plus 40&#37; light radius ring
gibous moon sword, misc minor pluses, minus 30&#37; light radius
kings bastard sword of the heavens, +15 all

With this set up I did a Laz run in normal/hell, using no 
infravision, using the kings sword and the plus light ring to offset 
gottdamn. The zero resist but blocking worked fine the whole run 
except briefly when I got swarmed and stuck next to two mages 
flashing me. That hurt enough that in hell/hell it would've been 
fatal in seconds despite a mana shield.

Before entering level 16 I removed the plus light ring and equiped 
the gibous moon for a net minus 70&#37; light radius.

I showed up next to what I guessed what Diablo's chamber. I circled 
it slowly, killing the knights and advocates that suddenly appeared 
in my darkened vision. Then I used an infravision scroll and 
confirmed it was Big D's place. I chose the least occupied corner 
there and teleported into it. This activated only two knights, which 
I killed without moving. I then fireballed everything in the chamber, 
slowly, deliberately, never coming close to hitting Diablo and never 
activating anything because their wake up call was also their good 
night gracie. I moved around the chamber during this, hugging the 
wall.

Soon just Diablo and I were in the chamber. I paused to take a 
screenshot, and then started throwing fireballs [level 15] at him. 
This woke him up, but he died just as he got to me.


Summary:
========
These techniques are very amusing. They are not an &#34;ultimate 
solution&#34; to how to play, however. Using the shield technique 
you'll find that when spells you can't block are being thrown your 
way [perhaps even &#34;friendly fire&#34;] your zero resist is gonna 
hurt.

The darkness technique is very surreal. The game is not as pretty 
when playing this way. It's no good for general co-op as your 
partners will activate the monsters and you'll suffer the 
consequences. You can't switch into darkness mode effectively unless 
you leave the level and then come back [tedious normally, but useful 
for recovery operations?]. 

Most important, the technique is most effective when using 
infravision [though even then you can not &#34;true target&#34; 
(cursor highlight] monsters you only see via infra, and so your aim 
won't be as certain]. And without cheating or tedious Adria shopping 
you'll use up all your available infravision scrolls too quickly.

So the next time you accidentally ID a Gottdamn and have some other 
minus light item available, throw 'em on and take a walk on the dark 
side--it'll prove most illuminating.</pre>
