<pre>IM SICK OF IT!!!!!

TheMan, I am following you.  You, Mikegod... errr...  Mikedog, and I 
will freelance in UO.  I am not quitting because some lamer got under 
my collar, or that being TO held to much responsibilities. No no no 
no no...  My destiny lies on a different path than Inferno's.  
PegLeg, &#34;Leader&#34; (Anything in &#34;&#34; I use very, very 
lightly) of Inferno, has &#34;kicked&#34; me out.  I know that most 
Inferno are gonna be pissed at me, but we can still be friends.  Its 
just a passing thing.  BOBO had it right... Dead right, its just a 
game!  PegLeg, flux-babe, Pyro, Sarco you are taking this game all to 
seriously.  If flux-babe thinks she is bossing me around, she has got 
it ALL wrong.  If PegLeg thinks he can kill me, Id like to see him 
try.  If Pyro thinks I cheat, care to duel again?  If Sarco thinks he 
can kill me, HA, Sarco could barly kill a ant let alone me.  To those 
people I just mentioned.  Pray to whatever god you worship, that you 
do not run into me on the UO battlefield.  Cause I will personally 
take my sword, and ram it so far down your throught it will not be 
funny.  But to the people that I am about to mention, all is well, 
you have nothing to fear from me.

FireBrand, I leave you my position as TO, cause I know people like 
you, and you like people.  Me, I didnt deserve a TO, I am more of a 
follower.  

LowRider, I know you wanted me to keep the thing going, but you cant 
live forever.

Tyrael, what can I say about Tyrael?  I could say a bunch of things, 
but it would not be appropriate for SnowRabbit's lil' sis.  ;)

One_Eyed_Bob, Arrrr...  I hope to see ye be capt'n of ye own ship 
matey, perhaps named The Jolly Rancher! (I will be posting more of 
The Inferno Chronicles)

DarkMage/Dennis, Ill ICQ you, we have things to talk about!!  =)

There are alot of people that I cannot think of at this time, but if 
I do, I will personally give you my farewell.

Its been real guys, and youll still see me on b.net, maybe we can go 
Pk'in together!

And to think, this all started when Anubisan, and Sarco, became 
Racists.....

&#34;Pierce me with steel, rend me with claw and fang.  As I die a 
legend is born for another generation to follow...&#34;</pre>
