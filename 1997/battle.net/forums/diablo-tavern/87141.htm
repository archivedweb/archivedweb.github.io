<pre>    HI,
   Ok, I promised my self I would not make direct posts to either of 
these issues, but oh well, here goes.
    Inferno, I don't know most of you who are still left in the NEW-
Inferno. I was aquainted with the old guard, most of which are now 
gone. So, I could careless about threats etc. I mean, you can't have 
any kind of &#34;war&#34; in Diablo. The game just doesn't allow for 
it. 
    THEMAN, first there is NO WAY IN HELL, that you can kill anyone 
wearing GPOW with a grandfather. SORRY, end of story. I have a 
warrior with a 305&#37; tohit, and still have a hard time cutting 
through that plate. That's using a Strange Sword of Slaughter with a 
149&#37; tohit.
The grandfather does tons of damage, but damage means nothing if you 
can't hit. No amount of skill will change that. 
    Now to all, let me explain generally what PoC is all about, by 
telling you what it is not.
    A: ..it is not  power vacumm for Tracy and Fist to play with.
          ....there simply is NO POWER to be had, we vote by quorum
              or not at all.
    B: ...it is not a place for politics and finding out who has the  
        biggest penis.
          ....we just wanna have fun. The reason most of the Inferno  
             members left Inferno was is no longer fun. Why play a    
           game that is not fun?
    c: ....it is not about taking a damn game too seriously and making
           one self into a chatroom/forum god.
          ....I am sure most of us would have no problem duelling     
          anyone who is not a known cheater. AND guess what? I        
       personally will admit that I might lose...thats right..I       
        might lose!! I have never been great at duels but love        
       to try anyway, and if I lose..big whoop...I lost.
 
       I am not really one for joining anything. But, when I was 
offered a chance to play with these guys, most of whom I have chatted 
with and played with for months now, I could not say no. The main 
purpose of our little group is FUN. FUN . FUN. I mean look at our 
titles we have given ourselves. We want to stay small, and have a 
good time. We might be masacred in the first week of the game....WHO 
GIVES A RATS ASS...Its a game. We are going to do our best to play 
the bad evil guys. Nothing more. Will we conquer Brittania?! Unless 
noone else shows up to play, and all the guards go to sleep...
..ummm...NO! I mean who would want to. If I wanted to rule the world 
I 
would go into politics. 
       So, folks all this idle banter about &#34;war&#34; is 
pointless. So just give it a rest.

       THEMAN, you say you won't duel Sam becuase you think he is a 
cheat....well how about duelling MORTE...I am sure he would love to 
duel you...and if you try to tell me MORTE cheats...well then you are 
just plain stupid. SO how about it ? hhmmmm...?(I wonder what your 
excuse will be this time)

&#34;I'm picking out a thermos for you...&#34;</pre>
