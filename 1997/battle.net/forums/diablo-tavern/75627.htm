&#62; Hello everybody!
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry part 5 took so long, but I've had lots of work at work lately...
&#62; hehehe.  Actually, I still do, and so this part won't be as long as
&#62; I had intended.  Well, hopefully, I will have more time soon...
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, here is part 5...  The previous 4 part smay be found at the
&#62; Tales of Tristam Library at:
&#62; <a href="http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm">http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4ef0231/diablo/index.htm</a>
&#62; 
&#62; Hope you like it.

&#62; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&#62; Part 5
&#62; 
&#62; They were greeted by cool air and a smell of incense.  As they walked 
&#62; inside Davion halted and looked about in wonder.  He had never seen a 
&#62; place this beautiful.  This chamber was huge!  First thing he noticed 
&#62; was the ceiling.  It loomed high above him and there was a painting 
&#62; on it that depicted a huge battle.  On the painting he could see 
&#62; hundreds of figures, angels and demons, fighting eachother.  He 
&#62; couldnt understand how someone managed to paint it there!  It was so 
&#62; high up and encompassed the entire ceiling!  Then Davion looked 
&#62; around and noticed that the chamber was long and somewhat narrow.  
&#62; Large widows with colored glass let plenty of light in and Davion 
&#62; took a moment to admire the beautiful scene.  They resumed walking 
&#62; and headed forward, towards an altar.  As they were approaching the 
&#62; altar Davion gaped in wonder at the beautiful sculptures of angels 
&#62; and fallen demons that adorned the walls.   
&#62; 
&#62; They soon reached the altar and Davions mother called to a boy who 
&#62; was tending it.  He came to them briskly, and she asked him if she 
&#62; could speak to a priest.  She said that its about her son Davion 
&#62; joining the order...  The boy said that he is a priest, but in this 
&#62; situation Davion and his mother need to talk to the high priestess.  
&#62; While the boy and his mother were talking, Davion stared at the huge 
&#62; statue of an angel that stood above the altar.  It was amazing.  
&#62; Davion has never seen an angel before, but he could believe that it 
&#62; was a real one, standing still.  It was beautiful.  It held a large 
&#62; Broadsword just above its head, pointing it straight towards the 
&#62; ceiling, with its wings stretched out, encompassing most of the 
&#62; front wall.  He snapped out of his thoughts when his mother tugged 
&#62; him to move.
&#62; 
&#62; They followed the boy into a medium size room, where he asked them to 
&#62; sit down and wait.  He then left through another door.  As they sat 
&#62; there, waiting, Davion and his mother curiously looked around the 
&#62; room, intrigued by all sorts of religious items strewn about.  A few 
&#62; minutes later the door opened again and the same boy came together 
&#62; with an woman.  The woman introduced herself as Nahni, High 
&#62; Priestess of the Temple of Tyrael while the boy went back into the 
&#62; main chamber.  Nahni then walked up to Davion, stopped,  and peered 
&#62; into his eyes.  Davions face turned red as he suddenly felt as if he 
&#62; carried a lot of weight.  After what seemed to Davion a long, long 
&#62; time, Nahni turned away and stood still.  She then asked him to wait 
&#62; outside while she has a talk with his mother.
&#62; 
&#62; After Davion left the room, Nahni turned back and spoke to his 
&#62; mother:  &#34;He has a great fear and hatred of evil.  What happened 
&#62; to him?&#34;  Understanding dawned on Nahnis face as Davions 
&#62; mother described the events that took place in Tristam barely a week 
&#62; ago.   After her tale was done, Eleen (Davions mother) said that her 
&#62; son wanted to join the Guards to become a warrior, but she wouldnt 
&#62; let him.  Instead, she thought that he would be happy here, in this 
&#62; great temple.  Nahni was silent.  She was lost in thoughts, 
&#62; considering what she just saw and heard.  She knew that there was 
&#62; more to this boy than met the eye.  For some reason, she recognized 
&#62; him.  To Eleen, she then said:  We will take him into the order.  
&#62; However, to cover our expenses and to support the church, we request 
&#62; and require a fee of 50 gold pieces per month.  This fee will be 
&#62; canceled if your son proves himself.
&#62; 
&#62; Eleen breathed a sigh of relief.  They accepted her son into the 
&#62; order and even the fee wasnt that big.  She could now rest, knowing 
&#62; that Davion was in good hands.  She was also proud of her son.  Being 
&#62; accepted into this Temple was an honor and its members were looked 
&#62; at with reverence.  She followed Nahni out of the room and into the 
&#62; main chamber.  She saw Davion staring at Tyraels statue.  Eleen 
&#62; smiled to herself.  She too loved to stare at it when she was small.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I know, I know.  Bad place to break, but I had to go back to work...
&#62; As always, all comments are very welcome.

	Very well done. I hope to see much more. (I know. Not the most 
original comments but it's hard to be original with so many ohters 
around here).
