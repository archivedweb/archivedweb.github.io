&#62; Greetings all,
&#62; 
&#62; Well the Laz Run story was so well received, I've dusted off a couple 
&#62; of others I had started and begun to clean them up.
&#62; 
&#62; Here is the first, done in the genre of one of my favorites, Dragnet.
&#62; 
&#62; Hope you enjoy. Please let me know if you would like to see more 
&#62; stories of this type.

&#62; 
&#62; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&#62; Dragnet - Tristram Style
&#62; 
&#62; 	This is the cit.., er... town, village er..., well you get the idea. 
&#62; 	The story you are about to read is true, the names have been mangled 
&#62; for no reason at all.
&#62; 
&#62; 	It's Saturday July 12, 2:30 a.m.
&#62; 	We're working Bunko Division in the Normal Diff game, &#34;Legits 
&#62; only!!&#34;.
&#62; 	My partner's name Gavan, just Gavan.
&#62; 	The captain is CohenBarbarian.
&#62; 	My name's Friday, Joe_Friday.
&#62; 
&#62; 	We'd been sent by the captain to patrol low level games in the hopes 
&#62; that we could stop and perhaps eliminate the passing of duped items 
&#62; to newbies.
&#62; 	We had created the game and proceeded to questions the locals.
&#62; 	I had gotten a little perturbed during our questioning of Cain, the 
&#62; so called village elder. All he wanted to do was examine what we were 
&#62; carrying.
&#62; 	&#34;Not a chance bub, this is all police issue and we owe it to the 
&#62; citizens to protect police property at all costs!&#34; was my reply. 
&#62; He fell silent. I motioned for Gavan to follow me around a nearby 
&#62; building. There we saw a small bridge that crossed the stream.
&#62; 	Now the other side of the stream is not an area of Tristram  to be 
&#62; taken lightly. Strange things had been reported to be happening near 
&#62; that witch's hut. We walked directly there. I did have to remind 
&#62; Gavan not to move his arms while walking. The kid was still new, so I 
&#62; corrected him gently.
&#62; 	Adria, the witch, was cooperative. She stated that she had seen 
&#62; dupers around the neighborhood earlier, but they had left before we 
&#62; arrived. She gave us descriptions. One was a tall warrior wearing 
&#62; full plate, she believed to be GPOW.
&#62; 	&#34;Obviously duped&#34; she said.
&#62; 	We nodded in agreement.
&#62; 	The other was a short Mage wearing robes. The only thing distinctive 
&#62; about him was that he had spindly legs. She had not gotten their 
&#62; names though.
&#62; 	&#34;Just like every other Mage in the world&#34; I thought to 
&#62; myself.
&#62; 	&#34;Thank you ma'am&#34; and we moved on.
&#62; 	As we proceeded to the home of Pepin, the healer, I ask Gavan to 
&#62; review what we had.
&#62; 	&#34;Nothing&#34; he said, and we continued on across Tristram to 
&#62; the opulent hut of Mr. Pepin.
&#62; 	&#34;Just Pepin, no Mr. required&#34; the healer stated.
&#62; 	&#34;How does a healer afford such a nice hut?&#34; I asked hoping 
&#62; to catch him in a lie.
&#62; 	&#34;Potion sales have been very good.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;How's that?&#34; I asked.
&#62; 	&#34;Everyone needs potions, sergeant&#34; was his slick reply.
&#62; 	I didn't trust him, but we had nothing to taken him in on so we 
&#62; continued the investigation.
&#62; 	Pepin had mentioned that he believed the mob might be using the peg-
&#62; legged boy, Wirt, as front to get rid of stolen merchandise.
&#62; 	We made a note and traveled directly across the north stream and 
&#62; found the boy, Wirt, lurking in a small grove.
&#62; 	&#34;Psst...&#34; he began.
&#62; 	&#34;Let's see your business license.&#34; I demanded.
&#62; 	&#34;Here!&#34; the seemingly innocent looking lad said as he tossed 
&#62; me a small piece of parchment. I examined it closely and couldn't 
&#62; find anything wrong with it.
&#62; 	&#34;Let's see you inventory&#34; I said.
&#62; 	&#34;Cost you 50 gp&#34; replied the boy.
&#62; 	&#34;Listen kid, we're the police. You'd better cooperate or we'll 
&#62; run you in&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;On what charge, cop!&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Selling crap as actually being worthwhile!!&#34;
&#62; 	That shut him up quickly. He knew I had him. He began to sing like a 
&#62; canary. There was duping going all of the time. He reported he had 
&#62; seen one warrior dupe a KSOH at least 3 times in one game. He too, 
&#62; had not gotten the name. Gavan took down the descriptions of the 
&#62; warrior  Wirt had seen duping and we left the grove.
&#62; 	&#34;Clean up your act, kid, or we'll be back&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I'll stop selling garbage and try to offer good items, Sergeant 
&#62; Friday, sir&#34; was Wirt's reply.
&#62; 	We headed south, to a small hut near the entrance to Tristram. There 
&#62; we found a dirty, ragged old man sitting outside. We identified 
&#62; ourselves.
&#62; 	In  very slurried speech the man identified himself as Farnham. We 
&#62; concluded that Mr. Farnham was inebriated, perhaps beyond reason. He 
&#62; was only able to mumble some incoherent story about, Gillian, a 
&#62; barmaid at Ogden's Tavern, the local watering hole. He passed out 
&#62; before he could tell us anymore.
&#62; 	&#34;Should we run him in?&#34; Gavan asked.
&#62; 	&#34;No, let him sleep it off. We have bigger fish to fry!&#34; I 
&#62; said and directed Gavan to follow me to Gillian's.
&#62; 	The comely miss lived in a small uptown hut with her grandmother. 
&#62; Tips at Ogden's must be better than I would have thought, from the 
&#62; nice furnishing in the hut.
&#62; 	&#34;A drink officers?&#34; Gillian asked.
&#62; 	&#34;No thanks ma'am. We're on duty. Just a few questions about 
&#62; dupers&#34;
&#62; 	The statement obviously hit close to home. Her face went white as 
&#62; sheet and she lowered her eyes.
&#62; 	&#34;Something you want to tell us?&#34; I pushed for an answer.
&#62; 	She broke down sobbing, her head in her hands, tearing streaming 
&#62; down her cheeks.
&#62; 	&#34;I fell for a warrior one night in the tavern. I know it's not 
&#62; good to mix business with pleasure, but it happened!&#34; she sobbed 
&#62; heavily, &#34;He was so cute and polite. We talked as I worked and 
&#62; when I got off he met me. We took a long walk out by the cows and 
&#62; through the cemetery. He was so easy to talk to.&#34; She sobbed even 
&#62; more and continued.
&#62; 	&#34;Just the facts, ma'am&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;I brought  him home for a nightcap. I went into the kitchen and 
&#62; when I came back out, oh god, what I saw!!&#34; she had trouble 
&#62; choking out the words, &#34;He was duping a GPOA, right there in my 
&#62; living room. I screamed for him to leave. He said everyone did it and 
&#62; not to overreact. I should go with and not be such a prude. I told 
&#62; him to leave!&#34; She broke down complete then.
&#62; 	&#34;Sorry ma'am it happens&#34; I said.
&#62; 	&#34;But I could have loved him!&#34; she sobbed.
&#62; 	We nodded in agreement.
&#62; 	&#34;You have his name, ma'am?&#34; Gavan asked the distraught woman.
&#62; 	&#34;Yes, it's      &#34; she managed through the tears.
&#62; 	I translated that to Omega. &#34;We'll be on the lookout for 
&#62; him.&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Can't this slime just use regular letters in their names&#34; I 
&#62; thought, &#34;Good thing this game doesn't have audio 
&#62; capabilities!&#34;
&#62; 	Our questioning of Gillian had led us to Ogden's, where we were 
&#62; headed now.
&#62; 	As we approached the tavern I noticed, Griswold, the blacksmith, 
&#62; standing outside his business. We decided to approach him before 
&#62; going to the tavern.
&#62; 	&#34;Hi, what can I do for you?&#34; was the blacksmith's greeting 
&#62; in a suspicious accent.
&#62; 	&#34;Hmmmm, could he be an illegal alien&#34; I thought to myself.
&#62; 	We identified ourselves.
&#62; 	&#34;Have you seen a guy named      ?&#34; I asked hoping to catch 
&#62; him off guard.
&#62; 	&#34;Not for quite a while, officer&#34; he answered.
&#62; 	&#34;That's sergeant Friday, Mr. Griswold. How long ago was it?&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Been a couple a days now&#34; the soot covered man replied, 
&#62; &#34;He comes around every few days, trying to push his duped stuff 
&#62; on unsuspecting newbies. Ruins my business. Who wants to buy the junk 
&#62; I sell if they can have premium items, for nothing.&#34;
&#62; 	We nodded in agreement.
&#62; 	&#34;I've almost gone out of business because of pushers like 
&#62; him!&#34; the blacksmith said gruffly.
&#62; 	We nodded in agreement.
&#62; 	Gavan and I commiserated with him, gave him our cards and headed for 
&#62; the Tavern.
&#62; 	A more wretched hive of .. oops, wrong story.
&#62; 	This place was filled with all sorts. We could tell we were not 
&#62; going to be very popular here.	
&#62; 	&#34;Anyone smell something?&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Who let THEM in here?&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;It's the fuzz, quiet!!!&#34;
&#62; 	Those were just some of the comments we heard.
&#62; 	Ogden the innkeeper was nowhere to be found.
&#62; 	We attempted to question a few of the patrons, but ran into a stone 
&#62; wall. No one would even give us the time of day.
&#62; 	Finally, we setup a stakeout outside the Tavern.
&#62; 	Time passes............
&#62; 	&#34;Joe, we've been in this game for an hour and nobody has joined. 
&#62; Can't we just move on to another game?&#34; Gavan ask me as we stood 
&#62; just outside Ogden's Tavern.
&#62; 	Ogden's Tavern, that den of vice and corruption. A hell hole that no 
&#62; decent human being would enter! That... Suddenly the game lags, we 
&#62; look at the hourglass for about 10 seconds and then the message that 
&#62; &#34;Charlie&#34; a level 6 character had joined the game.
&#62; 	&#34;Greeting&#34; he said.
&#62; 	&#34;Hello to you&#34; I answered.
&#62; 	Then the game lagged again.
&#62; 	Our luck was changing. &#34;     &#34; had joined the game.
&#62; 	&#34;Hey anyone need a GPOA or GPOW?&#34; he asked immediately.
&#62; 	&#34;What's that?&#34; Charlie asked innocently.
&#62; 	&#34;Only the best armor in the game&#34; laughed       obviously 
&#62; pleased at finding such a newbie in a game.
&#62; 	&#34;Oh, how much do you want for it?&#34; the inexperienced Charlie 
&#62; asked.
&#62; 	&#34;It's free, just for you!!&#34; the experienced warrior stated. 
&#62; It was clear he hoped to hook this newbie on duped equipment.
&#62; 	&#34;Ok, if that's ok. It's not cheating or anything is it?&#34; 
&#62; Charlie asked.
&#62; 	&#34;No sir, I found this myself!!!&#34;       stated flatly as he 
&#62; felt the hook sink into the newbie's mouth. He then tossed the GPOW 
&#62; on the ground near the fountain.
&#62; 	As Charlie reached for it, Gavan and I rushed from our hiding place. 
&#62; Gavan grabbed the plate, being certain not to get his fingerprints on 
&#62; it. I grabbed      .
&#62; 	&#34;You've hooked your last newbie, fellow! I'm taking you in for 
&#62; dealing in duped items. You have the right to remain silent, etc, 
&#62; etc. Do you understand your rights?&#34;
&#62; 	&#34;Listen copper, this shouldn't be illegal, after all the game 
&#62; allows it!! I'm just providing a service to newbies&#34; the warrior 
&#62; said.
&#62; 	&#34;Okay, fellow, you listen to me. It's scum like you that make 
&#62; the discovery of a great item worthless. Every newbie around has the 
&#62; best equipment there is. First it's a obsidian ring, then an obsidian 
&#62; zodiac amulet, pretty soon they graduate to GPOW or KSOH. They don't 
&#62; know how to play. If they get in a game and lose that equipment, 
&#62; where will they be? I'll tell you lost, they won't be able to 
&#62; continue until they find you or another scumbag like to fix them up 
&#62; again. Then the circle continues, until finally they give up because 
&#62; it's no fun anymore. Then they go back to Doom or maybe even 
&#62; something worse, like UO.&#34; I preached to him hard.
&#62; 	&#34;Is that what you want? How can you sleep at night knowing 
&#62; that's what you're doing? Most people want to play without worry of 
&#62; cheats like you, that's where we come in! We sweep the streets of the 
&#62; garbage and that's what we're doing here, sweeping the trash up&#34;
&#62; 	We took       in, knowing full well he'd be back on the streets 
&#62; again soon, but at least we had made an impression on Charlie, who 
&#62; had sworn to follow the straight and narrow by finding a non-cheating 
&#62; guild to join.
&#62; 	We felt we had succeed in our job for the night.
&#62; 
&#62;                                          
&#62; ...........................................
&#62; 	On July 15th  a trial was held in the Superior Court of Tristram. 
&#62; 	We all know the outcome of that trial.
