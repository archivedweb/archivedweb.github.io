<pre>Don't know if this will help but my friend had a similar problem and
the solution was to go into the bios and turnoff the second serial 
port. The modem comandeers one of them so you actually only have one 
available, but the bios didn't know that and kept looking for the 
second port as per tis software and what did it find everytime but 
the printer port. So turning off the second serial port as existing 
in the bios worked for my friend, maybe it would work for yuo too?

&#62; I'm seriously considering reformatting my HD. This is insanity. 
&#62; Lately it just does the most bizzare things- for example, it's got a 
&#62; hardware conflict between LPT1 and COM5. I don't have a COM5. I don't 
&#62; have any device installed which might even resemble a COM5. I've got 
&#62; a modem on COM1, a serial port on COM2, BUT NO STINKING COM5!!! Yet 
&#62; our wonderful friend, Win95 PnP, insists that I do. Not only that, it 
&#62; insists that every time I delete the damn thing that it should be 
&#62; reinstalled on exactly the same address segment as my printer port. 
&#62; Nice, isn't it? Then my lovely BIOS decides that this conflict has to 
&#62; be remedied by the setup program (which actually has no means 
&#62; whatsoever of solving such a conflict), so every time I turn it on I 
&#62; have to exit setup before Win95 will load. 
&#62; 
&#62; Netscape crashes for no apparent reason whenever I go to certain 
&#62; sites. 
&#62; 
&#62; Numerous programs I've uninstalled by simply deleting the files, 
&#62; instead of through control panel (sure, it's idiot-proof, it's just 
&#62; not reasonably-intelligent-proof!), so I get all kinds of funny 
&#62; messages at startup and even sometimes while running.
&#62; 
&#62; And of course, my Diablo load times are notorious.
&#62; 
&#62; Upgrade, you say? Ha! Show me the money, and I'll gladly do it =).
&#62; 
&#62; A HD reformat is scary, but compared to what I've been going through 
&#62; lately, it just might be worth it...
