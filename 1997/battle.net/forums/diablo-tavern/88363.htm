<pre>Well, I'm still technically running Diablo, (ah, the wonders of 
multitasking) so I'll keep it brief. I had the best run of luck in 
months today.. I've been playing for roughly 8 hours now.. hehe.
First, I was taking out levels 3-8 by my self (this is all as 
Aliera_e'Kieron, level 9 or so mage) and I found the following, in 
roughly this order (my memory isn't what it used to be): Steel mace 
of the mind, steel ring of light, rainbow cloak, steel scimitar of 
maiming, buckler of blocking, silver ring of v-something (+15 vit). 
Please note that I'm only listing the items that are exceptional or 
that I remember :)
  After this I was roughly level 17 or so, I think. Then I quit and 
headed back to chat, where I saw Zudini as *cogitates briefly* 
CohenLibrarian (level 12 warrior). He asked if I wanted to go 
adventure with him and a friend of his, a potential Snakegod recruit, 
and I agreed. To make a long story short, we had a great co-op game, 
Zudini's friend died about 15 times (I was only resposible twice), 
and it trailed off after we barely beat level 13. By the end I was 
level 22. Heres what I found, to the eternal angst of my groupmates 
(in no particular order): 
  2 books cl, 2 books fireball, other minor books, ring of magic, 
ring of the moon, topaz amulet of the eagle, steel sword of something-
 erother, steel sword of the stars, helm of the stars, helm of the 
wolf, blessed cap of sorcery, grand armor of the mind, chainmail of 
sorcery, blessed armor of sorcery, nonmagic field plate, and perhaps 
some other items I can't recall.
  Meanwhile, until about level 9 Zudini was running about with Robes 
of Health and a fine sword of corruption that I had found but 
rejected for obvious reasons (he kept the sword despite better items 
shoved in his direction), and the other player had armor of the sky 
and an axe of the leech. (somewhere around level 9 I found/bought all 
the cool armor and we ended up much better equiped). I think the gods 
of eq generation have finally decided to smile upon me!


Sethra, Snakegod

P.S. thanks to Zudini and ManiacTitan for not strangling me for 
hoarding all the luck. Good luck ManiacTitan on your snakegod 
membership.</pre>
