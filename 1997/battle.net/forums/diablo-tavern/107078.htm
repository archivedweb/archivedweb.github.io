<pre>Yawn....

First of all there are two different things:

Cheater and PKiller.. main difference is that PK is way of playing a 
game which includes competition.. if you sweep PK and cheaters in 
smae pile your so called researches(which I higly doubt exist at all) 
worth exactly half of false penny..... wait... I wouldn't even pay it 
for it.. congratulations with wasted time!!!!

 To do any sociological or any OTHER research , you have to actually 
uderstand what YOU research.. if you don't then you are wsting your 
time and perhaps money.... anyway, you seem to be anti-PK person who 
actually have NO clue of ways people play games.. I also dout U have 
any degree, based on weakness of your observations and 
argumentation...

here you go:

Tere are TWO magor groups of players:
Cheaters and NONcheaters(according to ONE description)

PKillers and Coopers....

Cheaters with nnoncheaters are about 15:1 .. i.e about 15 people use 
backups and duped items along with hacks and third party programs for 
each ONE noncheating player....

PKillers with Coopers(which includes cheaters) are about 1:5 where 
are their own separations..

anyway I prefer using forst system whch breaks people on chaters and 
noncheaters:

among NONcheaters there are 1:50 PKiller/cooper thingy.. why is it so 
low??? Because legit and masterfull PK is rare thing... I am talking 
about Diablo.... as you may notice among cheaters PK rate is much 
higher.... because they have nothing to do... game is way too easy.. 
but they still cannot be mixed with PKillers... they are same 
dumbasses with you (Coopers) who just way to bored with ruined game..

About PKilling in UO:

PKilling in UO is a bit different issue.. PKillers are divided on 3 
categories:

bad notoriety kills only
Facultative PK
Real PK

First ones are killing ONLY people who due to UO design are 
outlaws... they usualy got their bad notoriety off some MOnster 
ramble... and are usually coopers... so first ones are pretty much 
chikenshit anyway

Second are about as immature as it gets... they don't usually PK, but 
are eager for dogooding... I enjy wasting them in packs...

THird are usually expirienced and dedicated players.. who actually 
ROLEPLAY evil character in UO.... due to knowleges and abilities they 
usually have positive notoriety(I am usually Hnorable or Lord) and 
they PK mostly people based on Equipment or just likeness... I love 
killing Noble lords.... now....

I doubt U EVER met any real PKillers in either Diablo or UO, because 
all your arguments seem just broad generalizations derived from dumb 
stereotipe &#34;coopers&#34; created for themselves in order to 
justify fact that they suck in Online games...:

&#34;PK are no lifers and this is why they always beat us 
intoground... we have life and we are so darn sucessfull in RL, we 
have no time left for playing game .. we mostly chat exchanging our 
amasement as how good and cool we are&#34;

Now.... as U can actually see above is pile of BS.... they suck 
because they are NOT smart enough, not flexible enoug or/and spend 
too much time in chats whining and cussing PKillers... most of 
coopers spend about TWICE time online compare to me or some other 
PoCs... but what they do???? CHAT.... I PLAY..... Zudini??? he he 
eh.. ohh well....

anyway... your brioad and pretty much pathetic generalizations of 
what you THINK about PKillers show how little you know about people 
who PLAY online games.... go chat dude... there is NOTHING in game 
for you..... go to bars,.... U can talk to people there!</pre>
