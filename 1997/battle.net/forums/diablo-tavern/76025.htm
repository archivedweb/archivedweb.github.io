<pre>    hello slaves!
  First, Ishap..SHUT UP! You cheated to kill BLZ_BOBO and 
FLUFFY_BUNNY will not stand for your stupidity!!!!!!!
    ps. YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!
    NOW slaves, that the that is out of the way. FLUFFY_BUNNY, supreme
ruler of battle.net, has made a helpful guide for newbies.
  
    *******THE BOOK OF FLUFFY_BUNNY*******
         &#34;for convienient worshiping&#34;

  You must first recognize that FLUFFY_BUNNY is your master!!!! or
  YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!! Then the rest is easy.

   Now when you log on to my domain you will enter the chat area. You
 will meet other slaves and learn how to do my bidding. On the left 
 side of the screen are some buttons.
   THE CHANNEL button lets you roam to other chats to talk to other 
slaves.
   THE CREATE button lets you make your own game. This game must have 
praises to FLUFFY_BUNNY in the title. 
   THE JOIN button allows you to join other slaves in games all ready 
created. Pick one with the best praising title.
   THE QUIT button allows you to leave my domain. But why would you 
want to do that!!!!

    You will notice that all the slaves have a character icon next to 
their name. This tells you what the other slave's class is. Now on 
the other side of the name are little colored bars. These bars are 
the worship indicator. Slaves in good standing will have less bars. 
The colors stand for the following.
     Green = good slave, does much praising of FLUFFY_BUNNY.
    Yellow = Average slave. Needs to work on his worshiping.
       Red = BAD SLAVE.YOU WILL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!
    Some slaves will have one to three little red dots over their 
character icon. These represent how many times FLUFFY_BUNNY has 
brought them to their knees, begging to be spared. One dot for every 
100 times.

    
   There are terms in Diablo that you must understand in order to 
better worship FLUFFY_BUNNY.
   Guilds. Guilds are groups of slaves gather together so that they 
may worship FLUFFY_BUNNY.
   PK. PK stands for Peace Keeper. I someone who is a PK enters your 
game he will help you lighten you load. To make your trip easier. 
Some of the best Peace Keepers FLUFFY_BUNNY will recognize are slave 
TRACY_LORDS and slave MORTE. If you see them in you game. Invite them
down to keep the peace.
   Duping. When you duplicate and item. So he drops his stuff in 
front of the cows and presses alt+f4. FLUFFY_BUNNY will only 
encourage this specific type of duping.
   Hacks. Hacks are items which those who oppose FLUFFY_BUNNY use to 
try to make themselves worthy of challenging FLUFFY_BUNNY. YOU WILL 
ALL PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!!
   ISHAP. A new term FLUFFY_BUNNY has coined to be used to describe 
anyone who cheats in a duel. ALL my slaves shall from this day forth 
use this term for that situation.
   
    In order to comunicate quicker in the chats. Slaves use short 
hand typing codes to save on time. Here is one more to be used from 
this day forward.
     PBFTB. &#34;PRAISE BE TO FLUFFY_BUNNY&#34;. In order to get the 
maximum amount of worship in the least amount of time.

    Well slaves!!! WORSHIP ME!!!!or PERISH AT MY HAND!!!!!!

          -FLUFFY_BUNNY(KBC) - Supereme Ruler of Battle.net

ps. ISHAP! SHUT UP! YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO BE MY SLAVE!
