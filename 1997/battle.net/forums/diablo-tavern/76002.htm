<pre>this may sound strange, but i think i would believe tracy lords on 
this one.

i have been a member since day one, and i have seen a lot of members 
come in to snakegod, saying they dont cheat, but i think some do...

i have noticed a few members, who i will name here, that have items i 
believe to be cheated..

one high ranking warrior told me he had a kings bastard sword of 
blood. this sword also had the highest &#37;'s a kings sword can 
have..hmmm....i was mad at that, but wondered...where did he find 
this? 

another warrior told me he had a godlyy helm of whale,and an awesome 
shield of tiger. this wouldnt have been known had i not first asked 
him why he had 580HP...i thought i was the king of legit hp...well, i 
am, apparently this one cheated...

another member, one very,very close to my heart said he possesed an 
ob ring of zod....and that he had found two others which he had given 
away. (not obs of zod, but just plain old zod)

i have seen many people, lower in levels and far less skilled then me 
with items that make mine look like tinker toys.i know we have some 
cheats in here, and im not going on any witch hunts, since my time 
Playing diablo is over. (though i still come in to chat for a few 
seconds every now and then)when UO comes out, thats when i will meet 
with snakegod on the gaming field again..not until.

but tracy, i believe you...im sorry to say. just because he pk's 
doesnt mean he lies.i havent met tracy, but ive never heard him 
bullsh*t or lie like other infernos sometimes do.so shaft...as second 
in command (under spell) i hereby order you to say now if you cheat 
or not.if you do, then admit it, and we can forgive and forget, if 
you dont, and are totally honest, then things go on like usual, but 
if you say you ddint, and i hear something of this again, i think 
salmissra needs to hear about it.

ok, as for public games, i , during the past two months, played more 
public games then private...people dont believe me when i say this, 
but its true..i just didnt use kai.

i have TWO (2) public game characters, a level 31, 3 dotted warrior 
named jued_davanion (once dabbled in cheater killing,very little 
success.)
and of course, rivian_elasis

public games are great, but i guess no on bothered to do a whois on 
me by account number, because i was only pk-ed once as rivian, and  
only killed two times as jued (failed attempt to pk cheaters.....)

not all snakegods are cowards sugar dumplin...not by a long shot :-)

i still believe some snakegod dabble in cheating, just letting you 
all know....ohh, and tracy,for the record, kairaega doesnt trust 
anyone, he lets jued (my other character) fight his battles..hehehe

the man..leaving? hell, he should join UNHOLY HUNGER!! :-)
