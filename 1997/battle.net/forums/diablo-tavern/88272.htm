&#62; I gained 1.25 million by....
&#62; 
&#62; Killing about 130 enemies or so.
&#62; 
&#62; That is 1.25, maybe closer to 1.26, million experience points.
&#62; 
&#62; You gain 10K (1000*10=10000) experience per enemy.
&#62; 
&#62; Gosh, people, do the math.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man

Ok,

Now it's my turn to take a reasonable look into this situation.

I'm gonna ignore the exp. per monster thing and get straight down to 
some nice averages.  Normally, playing on through lvls 13-16 on hell 
dif, i recieve about 1 to 1 1/2 million exp per level.

Multiply that be 4 and that means The Man is probably getting 4 to 6 
million exp. per hell-hell run.  (This is assuming he kills EVERY 
single enemy.)

For a warrior, one hell run probably takes around 2 hours.  (Correct 
me if i'm wrong, i may be being a bit generous.)  But for good 
measure we'll say 2 hours.

If The Man plays 8 hours a day that means that he has time for about 
4 COMPLETE hell-hell runs.  He gains about 16 - 20 million exp. a day.

If he is gaining 20 million exp. a day (we'll use the high figure).  
That means in 10 days it would be possible to reach lvl 50.  Of 
course you have to assume that:

1.)  He plays eight hours a day every day.
2.)  He always gets around 20 million exp per day.

The math: 200,000,000 divided by 20,000,000 = 10

Which means that it IS possible to gain 200 million exp. in two 
weeks. 
You still have to take into account a few things though.  For a 
warrior, doing a hell-hell run has gotta be tough as sh#t. Every 
enemy has to be hacked at, including the soulburners.  Laz has to be 
killed. Which gives all warriors a major headache and makes them take 
A LOT of damage. And clearing out the advocates on lvl 16 must be a 
nightmare in itslef.

Considering these points now:

1.) The Man never leaves the chat room.
2.) The Man is in chat literally all day every day.
3.) The Man is always saying how he is very busy, yet he seems to 
have time to gain 200 million exp.
4.) Warriors are the hardest to gain levels with.
5.) Even with SnowRabbit (WAS lvl 40 mage) it took me hours and hours 
just to gain lvl 40.  Lvl 41 seemed like an eternity away to me.  I 
just can't imagine trying to gain lvl 50.
6.) The Man uses GrandMother sword.  (nuff said)

Taking all these things into account i believe that it IS possible to 
gain lvl 50 in two weeks, but The Man didn't do it.  The Man most 
likely cheats and the facts here should proove it.  The Man does play 
8 hours a day, but that is only if you count chatting as playing.
