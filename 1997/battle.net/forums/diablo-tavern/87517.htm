&#62; &#62; I had a problem with windows over the weekend, and got it back up and

&#62; &#62; I am not a cheater, and play in clan games.  I would like to know 
&#62; &#62; what the file names are, or extensions that diablo writes them too.  
&#62; &#62; Please help me out.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks in advance.

u should be ok if your chars are still located in windows ... if u re-
installed windows say bye bye..
if u didn't u probably changed the name of your pc one way or another 
.. if u did goto tech forrum and read janna's faq
WARGASM
&#62; A similar thing happened to me a while back.  This is probably 
&#62; because when you got your system back up, you either added Windows 95 
&#62; networking, and in doing so, you gave a new computer name for your 
&#62; computer.  Or you changed your computer name.  In either case, as far 
&#62; as I know, there is no way to retrieve your characters.  I've written 
&#62; Blizzard about this, and their reply was something like: &#34;Sorry, 
&#62; we can't help you, Diablo is built this way to discourage software 
&#62; piracy.&#34;  You cannot change your computer name.  If you do, your 
&#62; characters will disappear.
&#62; 
&#62; Good luck.</pre>
