&#62; In response to The Man's post about FFVII on page 2:
&#62; 
&#62; I've played through the Japanese version already (yes, I can speak 
&#62; and read Japanese very fluently), and although it is a great game, 
&#62; it's far from perfect.
&#62; 
&#62; Its one major flaw is the storyline, which starts off good, but 
&#62; becomes utterly horrible towards the end of the game. I won't get 
&#62; into specifics here, but lets just say that the end of the game was a 
&#62; major disappointment, considering how well done the first 2/3 was. 
&#62; This is something that I really hope is remedied in the American 
&#62; version. Considering all the work that's being put into it (Tetsuya 
&#62; Nomura is designing two new monsters for the American version of 
&#62; FFVII!), I wouldn't be surprised if they beefed up the story a bit. 
&#62; FFVII's linear nature will make it very difficult to for developers 
&#62; to make a drastic change though, and that's really what is needed. 
&#62; 
&#62; All of what I just said was confirmed in Gamefan some months ago by 
&#62; Casey Lo. I'm not making this up, people. This is a real problem that 
&#62; needs to be addressed.

yes! its true you guys.  FFVII is not all what you think it is. sure 
the movies and the battle scene are awesome but the story line is 
very dissapointing.  So, if you guys just want to see some pretty 
awesome effects, then I recommend you buying the game.  If for story 
plot, ummm, if you can read Japanese, go buy Dragon Warrior 7.</pre>
