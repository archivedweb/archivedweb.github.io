<pre>Oh the mischief I got into last night...

I created a new sorceror named &#34;Static&#34;.  I found an honest 
no-pk game to play in.  Another legit character, &#34;Elena&#34; was 
there too.  A couple of cheater characters joined in with non-
descript pk-ish names.  Before I went 2 rooms in the church, I heard 
Elena die.  Then in walks this rogue level 2 or 3 or so adorned in 
godly junk.  Boom... I'm restarting in town.
  &#34;I'll kill you!!!&#34; I shouted, went to Pepin, then charged 
down.  I was smiling as I entered the church, found that bad girl, 
and BOOM... restart in town again.
  She jeers &#34;Boy you sure did a good job killing me.&#34;
  I laughed... &#34;No more mister nice guy!  I will kill you slowly 
for that... 1 hp at a time!!!&#34;.  Pepin fixed my health, &#34;This 
time I have PLAYER ATTACK ENABLED so you had better watch 
out!!!!!&#34;.
  I went down, hit F12 several times and made my level 1 sorcerer 
shoot a short bow at her.  They all missed of course.  Boom.  Restart 
in town.
  Elena finally sent me a private message &#34;So when are we gonna 
kill them for real?&#34; and I responded &#34;Nah this is more 
fun&#34;.
  Finally the other cheater decided he wanted to be in on it so he 
attacks my puny sorceror and kills him.
  &#34;Ahhh, so you won't fight me yourself?  You send your puppet 
boys after me?  Scared, eh?  I'll get you yet!&#34;.
  Several restarts later, I lagged out of the game.

I got into a few boring coop games (I was not in the mood to actually 
PLAY diablo) then tried a cheater's trading game with my sorceror up 
to level 3, still wearing normal stuff.
  &#34;Got any rings&#34; the guy asked.
  &#34;I got good ones&#34; I responded.
  &#34;Like what?&#34;
  &#34;Ring of power.  It's hacked up pretty good.&#34; I grinned.
  &#34;Really?  What is it?&#34;
  &#34;+255 all attribs, +335&#37; armor and to-hit, permanent 
infravision.  It kicks butt in duels!&#34;
  &#34;Wow!  Can I have it?&#34;, you could almost sense him drooling 
on his keyboard.
  &#34;No way, I only have 1&#34;, I laughed.
  &#34;Can I borrow it?  I can dupe it and give yours back.&#34;
  &#34;No I'd rather trade it for something good.&#34;
  &#34;I have obsidian rings of the zodiac&#34;
  &#34;Got 2 of them.&#34; I lied.
  &#34;Gottdamerung?&#34;
  &#34;Got it.&#34; I lied again, smiling, &#34;Don't you have 
anything ORIGINAL to trade???&#34;
  &#34;You name it, I'll get my other character and give you whatever 
you want!&#34;
  &#34;Do you have Amber Scimitar of Saintly Spanking?&#34;
  &#34;No.  What is it?&#34;
  &#34;I was dueling someone with one, he kicked my butt with it!&#34;
  &#34;None of my stuff is any good.&#34;
  &#34;Oh well.  You need to get Ring Enchanter 3.2&#34;
  &#34;What is Ring Enchanter?&#34;
  &#34;It's a great hack application for windows 95.  You can fix up 
rings to do all sorts of things.&#34;
  Then he begged me for a while, so I gave in... (hehehe)
  &#34;Look&#34;, I said, &#34;I'll give you something useful, 
ok?&#34;
  &#34;What?&#34; he was definitely drooling now.
  &#34;Do you know about hidden properties?&#34; I pokerfaced.
  &#34;Huh?&#34;
  &#34;Check this out.&#34; I opened my inventory and took out a 
single gold coin and dropped it.
  I watched him approach and remarked &#34;Be sure you put it in an 
empty slot.&#34;
  He picked it up.
  I continued &#34;Be careful, if it gets mixed with other gold coins 
it'll lose the hidden properties&#34;.
  &#34;Oh D***&#34; he whined, &#34;It automatically lumped it with 
my gold, can you drop another?&#34;
  &#34;Hold on&#34;, I replied, then took another single gold coin 
and dropped and picked it up several times as if I were making a bad 
attempt at duping it.  &#34;OK.&#34;
  He picked it up, &#34;OK I did it right this time.  What does it 
do?&#34;
  &#34;It's very useful in duels, it has the no-spells factor on 
it.&#34;
  &#34;No spells?&#34;
  &#34;Yes, no spells can hurt you, well except for flash and bone 
spirit.  But people don't use them much.&#34;
  &#34;Cool!&#34;
  &#34;Also it automatically teleports your character away from 
someone if they get too close.  But be careful to keep it in a 
separate inventory slot or else it loses all its hidden 
properties!!!&#34;
  &#34;I will, thanks!&#34;
  &#34;Anytime.&#34;

  I got bored with him and left.  Joined a game &#34;NEWBIE&#34;.  
This should be fun...heh heh.
  I was on church 1 with a fighter and in comes a sorceror level 43 
&#34;Izrael&#34;.  He comes down and teleports into the room we were 
at and hits Chain Lightning.  Dead, I restarted in town immediately.
  &#34;Please res me&#34;, I begged.
  &#34;I can't see you&#34;, Iz responded.
  &#34;I can't see much either, the screen is all red.  I was behind 
you when you hit chain lightning.&#34;
  &#34;You were?  I can't see you&#34;
  &#34;Wait I saw you a minute ago, go back!&#34;  I laughed to 
myself.  The other legit guy walked by in town and he must have been 
laughing too because he didn't say a word to Iz.
  &#34;Go ahead and restart in town&#34;, Iz finally gave up.
  &#34;No, please res me!!!&#34; I demanded.
  I entered the church and found a quiet place to stand while 
istening to him teleport all over the dungeon.
  &#34;Where are you???&#34; he bounced all over the level.
  &#34;Wait... I saw you again... go down and left a bit.&#34;
  More teleports, and suddenly he chances to teleport within sight of 
me and stops... pauses.
  &#34;Oh we're playing a little game, are we?&#34; he glared at me.
  &#34;Aren't we?&#34;  I laughed.
  He killed me, of course.  I asked him to res me, so he did and 
killed me again.
  I begged him to res me again and he did.  Then I started to shoot 
my bow at him.  This time it was a +3 dex bow (wow).  He popped me 
again.
  This other guy entered the game and I watched them pound on each 
other with maximum firepower.  They went at it for a few minutes, 
then realized they were both on godmode.  So they decided to kill my 
level 3 sorceror again... I was res'd and killed a few times, then 
they made a firewall over me so they only had to res over and over.
  I finally said &#34;Hey this other guy got pkilled 208 times 
yesterday.  I think I might beat his record!&#34;
  They stopped and left me dead in the flames.  I heard them dueling 
again.  I couldn't help but laugh because they were both on godmode!! 
 Then Iz and I were left in the game.
  I got to talking with Iz and found out he had drunken 5 shots of 
bluelabel scotch and something else so I suggested he get some water 
before going to bed to avoid a hangover.  He was a bit friendly once 
you talked personal with him, heh.  He res'd me as 2 other other
players entered the game.  They were coming for him!
  I said to Iz, &#34;Let's get them!&#34;
  &#34;Where are you?&#34; they asked.
  &#34;Level 2... by the stairs.  Come and get it.&#34; I responded, 
&#34;Prepare to die!!!&#34;
  &#34;Oh yeah?  You will die, unless you are godmode.  Either way, 
not much loss to me.&#34;
  &#34;I'm waiting&#34;.
  Iz didn't wait.  He ran upstairs.  I followed.  I heard teleports 
all over the place then Iz comes over, &#34;Follow me&#34;.
  He showed me someone's ear.  I picked it up, &#34;Yummy ear.  Got 
ketchup?&#34;
  The other guys were ready to come back, they said something to that 
effect.
  &#34;Come on down!  I will kill you with my bada** +3 dex 
bow!!!&#34; I challenged them. &#34;Iz wait up, I'll protect you!&#34;
  Level 43 Izrael laughed.  Finally the other guys got frustrated 
against Iz's godmode and left.
  I got bored and left too.

I destroyed my sorceror and created a warrior named &#34;Taunt&#34;.  
He had some fun too... same old stuff.  I left player attack mode on 
and accidenty hit a few sorcerors.  &#34;Sorry&#34;.  Heh heh.  I 
never did actually kill anyone, tho.

Anyway, It was fun in the public games last night!</pre>
