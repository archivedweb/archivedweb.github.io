<pre>Hello everyone. This is the second chapter of my tales in Tristram, 
and I hope you like it. &#60;smiles&#62; As long as my pockets hold 
out, free ales for anyone who asks! I post my tales so that others 
may not make my same mistakes. Ogden told me that by putting this 
word up, people could see the first chapter of my story.

Thank you for reading this, hope you enjoy it.

------------------My Comings - Chapter 2----------------------------

	Sairkon was tired. He had stayed in Ogden's all day, but once Ribs 
had left, he found himself bored. Everyone had left for the night, 
but he had no recollection of them leaving. His long, gangly brown 
hair flopped into his eyes as he sipped his drink. He turned from the 
counter and stared out of the open door. It was a cool night, the 
wind blowing around a bit of fog. Sairkon looked down as the fog 
glopped onto his foot. Oh dear, he thought, that isn't fog. He mopped 
the vomit off of his foot and went outside to find out where it had 
come from.
	&#34;Rwwwyea!&#34;
	&#34;Blrglrlwrgle!&#34;
	A young man was in the Town Square. His hair was dirty, drenched in 
vomit. His clothes were tattered, bloody, the ichor staining - Please 
stop, interrupted Sairkon, I don't like to think of such things.
	He was surrounded by small creatures half his size. They were blue, 
impish creatures, covered with scales, and all held swords that 
Sairkon had not seen before. When he pointed at them he saw a 
desciption in his sight:

			Dark One
			HP 12-18
			No Magic Resistance

	Sairkon shook his head, and the description went away. How strange 
that was, like something out of a computer game. Sairkon frowned, 
realized he didn't know what he was thinking about, computers hadn't 
been invented yet. He stepped forward, and realized that the man was 
on the ground. &#34;Sir, why don't you get up?&#34; he asked of the 
man, who was now beset upon by several of the small creatures. 
Sairkon took a second glance at the man, and came to a new 
realization: he was being hurt. Oh dear, thought Sairkon, I don't 
like to hurt anything, but they are hurting him . . .
	The man tried to make up Sairkon's mind. &#34;You idiot! Help me for 
god's sake, Auugghhh!&#34;
	Sairkon silenced him with a finger and a smile. Maybe if he asked 
the creatures to stop - &#34;Auugghhh!&#34; He could barely think 
with all of the man's yelling. Oh dear, Sairkon thought, maybe he 
really is in trouble. Back at Sairkon's home, the guards had always 
stopped all of the trouble. Ahh, home. . . The strange ways of 
everyone in this town of Owowowowow (see first story - Ribs) were 
confusing him He fondly remembered a time when - &#34;Dear gawd, it 
hurts!&#34; Hmm, Sairkon thought, nostalgia put to rest for the 
moment, I'd better help him quickly. Grimacing at the thought of 
harming the creatures, he recalled some of the teachings from his 
papa, and rose his hands. Flames flared up around him, and a small 
bolt of flame shot out and struck the creature that perched on top of 
the man's face. 
	The man jerked his head up, and twisted the dead creature off of his 
face. The others were scattering quickly, and the man got up. He 
looked at the retreating creatures, and rose his hands. Lightning 
shot out from them, in many streams. They all struck the creatures in 
the back, and almost all were bowled over, dead. Sairkon shuddered - 
&#34;Hey! this is my paragraph!&#34; yelled the man. He turned to 
Sairkon. &#34;Thank you for the help, stranger. Though ill-timed, you 
saved my life My name is Zudini, and I am in your debt.
	Sairkon smiled brightly, glad that the man was showing such 
gratitude. He didn't know if he should have done anything, he wasn't 
sure if the man wanted any help. &#34;Hello sir, my name is Sairkon. 
I am happy to lend a hand&#34; He frowned. &#34;Those creatures, they 
aren't. . .dead, are they? I'd be sick if I ever killed anyone.&#34;
	The boy's nuts, thought Zudini. &#34;Son, what do you think they 
are? You even shot one yourself.&#34;
	&#34;So, what are they?&#34; Sairkon smiled self-conciously. 
&#34;I'm only a young mage, I do not know much yet. My papa sent me 
out to seek my fortune.&#34;
	&#34;Kid, you have a lot to learn before you make a fortune. In this 
land, you are going to have to kill to get ahead. I'm sorry, but 
that's going to be the way it is.&#34;
	Sairkon grimaced. &#34;I. . .I can't kill anyone.&#34; The young 
mage was flustered now, his small mind was filled with discomfort at 
killing another. &#34;Well, uhm...&#34;
	Zudini interrupted him. &#34;Sairkon! You saved my life. I will 
always look to you as a friend, but you must listen. I owe you a debt 
of gratitude. I will fulfill my debt to you with the thing I believe 
you need most: knowledge. A long time ago, there were Seven evils, 
but Three were far stronger. . .&#34;

	And so Sairkon, the young mage, learned about the town he was in, 
and the terrible state of it. He learned about the tales of the Three 
Evils, Baal, Mephisto, and Diablo. He learned of the tales of great 
King Leoric, and the sad state that he is in. Dreams, whispers, flew 
by, as Sairkon tried as hard as he could to keep up. The thing that 
first caught his attention was the church. The once-holy place was 
now desecrated, according to Zudini. Sairkon's face took on a never-
seen-before look of consternation. 
	&#34;They have desecrated the church? I have been brought up 
treating the church as the highest place of honor, and those 
monsters. . .&#34;
	&#34;Sairkon, this is a perfect place for you to begin your 
quest.&#34; Zudini smiled. &#34;Down in the labyrinths of the church, 
there is an evil demon there. I have not met this evil, but I have 
heard the story. Not long ago, the Arch-Bishop Lazarus summoned many 
of the townpeople. He drove them up into a frenzy, convincing them to 
smite the evils of the church, and take back their place of worship. 
They were all slaughtered, by a demon that Lazarus called the 
Butcher. Avenge them, if you are able. Perhaps with this, you may 
start on your quest for fortune and knowledge, and with these will 
come experience.
	&#34;Perhaps your papa wanted you to come here, to Tristram. Maybe 
this is the place for you to find your fortune. You know, young man, 
fortune is not only money. You may find your fortune in knowledge, in 
friends, in love. And, I think I know where you should come for help, 
if needed. I may not always be around, you know. There is a place not 
too far from here, a castle belonging to a guild of strong warriors, 
some mages, some archers, and some warriors who fight with sword in 
hand. They are called the Ordo Rosae Moriatur, the Order of the Dying 
Rose. Find them, and may they help you on your quest.&#34;
	And so the man closed his eyes, and suddenly disappeared, teleported 
away to who knows where. Sairkon was left alone, with only a whisper, 
and a direction. 


Thus begins the tale of Sairkon, the young mage. May the light shine 
upon him always, and may he complete his quest with honor.
