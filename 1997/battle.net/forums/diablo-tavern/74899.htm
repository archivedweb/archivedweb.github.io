<pre>Greetings all ye distinguished guests..

The power of the written word swells within our noble heritage..
be it prose or verse I thank you all for the gift given and the 
passion that follows...

This is the latest in my string of Poems
I included the others as well..
All three class all in one all to complete..

and a lost soul to end..



Enchanter enchanted


Sapphire dreams,
Mana intimate
Magi hymns 
spells cultivate

Learned buried lore
from pages mystic
Thirst forevermore
binary spells cryptic

The carved runes snakes into one.
From the ebony length of my Staff
As I beseech memories of furious flame.
The shadowed realm that is my path.
Fire bright and golden pyre, sweet pain.
It feeds unto me and my craft.
It takes and gives. none to blame.

Awaken within my passion heart
The flame remembers
I murmur mana it purrs.
My soul and its fire, never apart.
It grows and grows
yet never knows
that soon  it will finally depart.

As of me? I will remember
that flavor of a flame.
But it will never be the same.
The spell completes the fire.
Part of me dies
as the flame flies.

Arcane I 



Rogue's song:

The Deep walls breathes shadows.
Malicious shades echoes my heart.
Torches as silent guardians in rows/
observes this drama, night'part.

The stone floor whispers of past deeds.
Damned creature wicked, twisted
Its presence foul and distorted.
advancing, forwarded by evil seeds.

My fear yells sudden as pain.
Memory clouds,bitter rain.
fly real my arrow, to the center.
bright morrows to discover.

Shrieks and demonic hatred,
ancient guttural torment
by my shaft ended.
Midnight blood ardent.

My dread is my companion
the victory I share with the night,
I will yet see another fight.
beneath this cold dungeon.

And the still sentinels of the sodden corridor.
acknowledge the Archer and her fervor.
While the floor remembers the evil,
A bloody barb rest until another peril.

The book is written
by words forbitten
and love awaken 
nor forsaken..


Warrior Rise!!


My blood rages
Facade of ages.

My soul screams
of doom it seams

Listen all, hark to my sword.
Death to the shadow horde.
and life? yes sweet flowing life.
heed my plea of strife.

can you hear my Friends!
The tortured cries of fiends. 

I strike and strike and then another
again and again, sadden by such anger.

I lay down my sword bloody
and name my sanity.

There! over my shoulder.
Do you see it?
Did you feel it?
The ultimate soldier.

Yes! of my pain Death follows.
Past my shade it awaits to drink again.
drink to me drink to my sorrows
I will live by the sword and!!

DIE.

Another turn of the page.
and the world'rage.
The hounds of fear
blessed from a tear.
sorrow mine 
sweet wine.

We are legion


Ode to the lost soul:

Colorless countenance and darken cadence.
A movement of souls by hell'woes.

Lost I am and was and will
beneath my time I kneel.
On this road paved by blood.
Mine and yours crimson flood.

Flavorless stance and sadden dance.
Stagnation moles in fell holes.

Forgotten, never to see and feel.
Above my space and keel.
A journey carved a passage odd.
Ours, just a fleeting nod.

Ageless defiance, useless temperance.
forbitten rose, omen crows.

Found, I am legion.

Baltazar..


Well that was a mouthfull..
If you are reading this now,
A million thanks froma would be poet...

Sincerely.
