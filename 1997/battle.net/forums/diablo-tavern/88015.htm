&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Are weird & gloomy shrines in mult-player?  Never saw one yet & I'm a 
&#62; &#62; legit level 41 :(
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks in advance,
&#62; &#62; DW
&#62; 
&#62; I spent literaly weeks trashing the church and the cats daily and I 
&#62; found a little over 5 of each. Weird and Gloomy, Weird is harder to 
&#62; find IMHO.
&#62; Rare? Hell yes! 
&#62; But not non-existant. 
&#62; Unless they have changed that in the last couple patches. But I doubt 
&#62; it. 
&#62; 
&#62; I believe some things arent as &#34;random&#34; as others. Like GPOW, 
&#62; I have heard of one other person who claims to have found it. If its 
&#62; truly random then there would be a set &#37; chance of finding it, 
&#62; yet there isn't that much of it floating around that isnt duped. 
&#62; Considering there are thousands of people playing hours at a time, I 
&#62; would think there would be more of it around.
&#62; 
&#62; I guess I'll have to do some church trashing and see how long it 
&#62; takes to find one again. I don't play enough anymore to really care, 
&#62; but it would be sad to think I was one of the last to waste 6 hours a 
&#62; day for three weeks straight looking for em.
&#62; 
&#62; See ya soon!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;

&#62; 
&#62;        Cuda       O;) 


That's good news indeed Cuda, thanks for the quick reply.  To level 1 
I go to power up my strange bow of burning :)  Die fallen one die! 
heh he  

As for the GPOW, I doubt I'll ever find that.  Shame about yours 
though:(

Cya around,
