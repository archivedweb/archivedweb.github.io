<pre>A Ray of Light

	The ruby sun had set only a few minutes ago when Shinnarhra, Cohen, 
Morteleux, and little Knax felt a blast of wind as Stonehaven landed 
on the rocky ledge. Knax began hopping up and down excitedly until 
Morteluex calmed him down with an apple. Shinnarhra could have sworn 
that she saw a figure seated on the great dragon's back but after she 
had turned her attention away from Knax and focused on Stonehaven 
once more she could no longer see the figure. 

	Stonehaven walked over to the fire where his friends; his monstrous 
feet crunching the loose rock beneath him, were seated. While he was 
away they had told each other of how they all first met Stonehaven 
and of some of their most recent significant memories. Shinnarha was 
puzzled at the wide grin that was spread across Stonehaven's face. 
&#34;Stonehaven!', she began, &#34;what happened?&#34; Stonehaven 
said not a word but stepped aside revealing a tall slender woman two 
years older than Shinnarhra. Her hair was of the same black shade as 
Shinnarhra'a and she held all sitting round the fire in a mesmerizing 
gaze from glassy blue eyes. She wore tattered leather armor and 
several healing wounds on her arms and bruised face. Despite her 
rather haggard appearence she wore an irreplacable smile accompanied 
by tears of extreme releif and joy. &#34;Xandrea!!&#34;, Shinnarhra 
cried. Xandrea moved past Stonehaven and rushed towards her sister 
where they embraced. &#34;I thought you were dead!&#34;, Shinnarhra 
said as she wept tears of joy. Xandrea did not say anything. She was 
too over joyed at beeing re-united with her younger sister. They held 
each other, their bodies shaking as they wept.

	Shinnarhra and Xandrea reluctantly ended their embrace and joined 
the rest of the group by the fire. &#34;Shinnarhra&#34;, said Cohen 
who was wore a slightly confused expression on his wheathered face, 
&#34;you told us that Xandrea was killed by orcs.&#34; &#34;I thought 
she was&#34;, answered Shinnarhra who eyes were still streaming 
tears. &#34;Maybe I should fill in some gaps&#34;, Xandrea said to 
the group, except for Stonehaven who new well what had happened. 
Xandrea then went on to explain how the army of orcs who had attacked 
the inn so long ago captured her and were planning on using her as 
breeding stock for a orc human hybrid. &#34;They didn't 
actually...&#34;, Shinnarhra began to ask. &#34;No. They were going 
to do the honours once they reached a fortress they had built some 
distance away.&#34; Xandrea answered with some relief, &#34;we were 
side tracked when the orc war chief attacked the kingdom of Nimia and 
we then set off in pursuit of the fleeing army.&#34; 
&#34;Shinnarhra&#34;, added Stonehaven who had suddenly broke his 
silence, &#34;that night when I left you alone I was searching for 
Xandrea. When no taces of her could be found at the ruined inn I knew 
that the orcs had taken her prisoner. I found them early the next 
morning but they had been joined by a large force of orcish 
necromancers and I decided it was far to risky to attempt a rescue 
then. I knew Xandrea would not be harmed so I returned to inform you 
of my news when I found you attacking a small army of orcs.&#34; 
Everyone looked to Shinnarhra upon hearing of her foolish assault on 
the army single handedly. Cohen laughed, &#34;Shinnar, your either 
very corageous or fool hardy.&#34; Everyone chuckled lightly at the 
comment as Shinnarhra slightly blushed. &#34;Wait a minute&#34;, 
Morteleux quickly jumped in, &#34;from what I've learned in my many 
travels I've never known of an instance where an orc has ever raped a 
human or a member of any other race for that matter.&#34; 
&#34;True&#34;, said Stonehaven thoughtfully as he stared out at the 
starry sky, &#34;the orcs of Middle Earth rarely practice such a dark 
act. These orcs, how ever, have changed in their behaviour quite 
drastically since I last fought them so long ago.&#34; Cohen's eyes 
lit up. &#34;You fought against the orcs of Middle Earth during the 
War of The Ring?&#34;, Cohen asked with great astonishment. 
Stonehaven turned his head to face his warrior friend. &#34;That was 
a long time ago and another tale&#34;, the dragon smiled and then 
turned again to the night sky. The rest of the group looked to 
eachother with curious expressions. Only Morteleux knew of what dark 
event Stonehaven and Cohen spoke of and then only slightly. Xandrea 
looked to Stonehaven who's back was turned to the adventurers and 
then continued with her account, &#34;after defeating the remnants of 
the Nimian army the orcs were begining to set out for their fortress 
when Stonehaven crashed down onto their camp and set it a blaze. I 
was terrified. I did not know if he was there to help me or was 
simply going to kill evey living thing there but my question was soon 
answered when he located the tent in which I was being held and flung 
me onto his back and took off.&#34; Xandrea turned to Stonehaven and 
smiled. He remained motionless. It was if he was waiting for some 
occurance to take place in the sky. &#34;So, Nimia is no more&#34;, 
Morteleux said thoughtfully. &#34;They were wiped out by the orcs. 
Their ally, Suldor, has also been lost to another invading force of 
orcs which will be joining with the before mentioned one&#34;, 
Stonehaven said gravely. 

	&#34;So now what&#34;, said Cohen, &#34;we have quite the 
respectable party here. It would be a real shame if we were to go our 
separate ways tomorrow.&#34; &#34;I am glad to hear you say 
that&#34;, Stonehaven replied to the warrior. Stonehaven walked over 
to the fire and joined his friends. Stonehaven explained to the small 
gathering why he was in this part of the land in the first place and 
where he was headed. He told of how he was heading for the distant 
kingdom of Erealsdore before he was side tracked by Shinnarhra. 
&#34;I wish there was some other way to tell you all this &#34;, he 
continued, &#34;but Diablo has left a dark legacy behind for us to 
deal with. Everyone was taken by surprise at the sudden mention of 
the dark lord. &#34;When he was destroyed it was beleived that the 
souls of all those who had perished in his dark domain were released. 
That is not so. Indeed, most of the imprisoned souls were released 
but predicting his demise the dark one constructed another stone to 
hold what ever souls he could transfer into it's cold walls before he 
would be destroyed.&#34;, said Stonehaven. The faces of the small 
group turned grim at hearing the news. &#34;I am going to continue my 
journey to Erealsdore where a force will be then sent forth to 
destroy the stone and release the souls. I am joining them as I am 
the only one who knows of the hidden location of the stone's resting 
place.&#34; &#34;You can count me in, my friend&#34;, Cohen said with 
a grin as he slapped Stonehaven on the shoulder. &#34;I would be 
happy to acompany you as well&#34;, replied Morteleux who could sense 
that there was far more to Stonehaven's story then he was letting on. 
Knax gave out a growl accompanied with a few snarls. &#34;I guess 
Knax is going to&#34;, Morteluex said with a smile and patted the 
gargoyle on the head. Shinnarhra and Xandrea offered to join them as 
well. &#34;I feel I should warn you&#34;, stated Stonehaven, &#34;it 
is a long and perilous journey to the kingdom of Erealsdore. We will 
have to overcome many obstacles to reach our destination.&#34; 
&#34;Obstacles!&#34;, scoffed Cohen with a smile, &#34;are only put 
on this earth to be knocked down!&#34; 

	The small band of adventurers settled down for the night. Cohen and 
Morteleux stuck to their side of the fire while Xandrea and 
Shinnarhra stayed on their side all the while  chatting about how 
glad they were to see eachother. Knax curled up in one of Morteleux's 
leather pouches and was soon emitting a loud snore. Stonehaven had 
returned to the edge of the ledge and continued to stare off into the 
distance. As Morteleux drifted off he was still haunted by the sense 
that Stonehaven was hiding something that would have great 
reprocussions in the future.


	I kind of rushed this part (I REALLY want to get the story off this 
damn ledge!) For those of you who have been asking me when will there 
be some action; it's coming. This has nothing to do with my story but 
I just wanted to let everyone know that I am finally getting a new 
computer. Say good bye you mind numbing 60 Mhz CPU! No, it's not a 
PC, well actually it is a combination of both. So very soon I won't 
have to wait, oh about seven or eight months for a Blizzard game to 
reach the Mac. Well, feel free to comment on my story. Let's 
see...Cohen, you still have yet to show that barbarian brutality 
towards my work. Snap to it! Morteleux, Wiseman, Tech-Deamon, Cohen, 
Rikor, and all the others (maybe I should invest my $ into some 
memory. Like the kind you slam inside your brain to remember names), 
I send you many thanks for your support.
