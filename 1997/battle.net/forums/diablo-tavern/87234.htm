Tales of the White Wolf — Chapter Seventeen

	Mardran eased himself through the small opening in the cavern wall. 
The rock felt warm yet very damp to the touch. He wiped the sweat 
from his brow as he reached for the torch that was mounted on the 
wall just inside the entrance. He pointed the torch south down what 
looked like an endless passage.
	He began to follow this long narrow passageway taking care not to 
slip on the damp flooring. Every few hundred feet a side tunnel would 
branch from this main corridor and disappear off  into the distance. 
There were very few torches as he went along, but all seemed to burn  
an invisible power source, a source that Mardran knew was based on 
magic. 
	The last few hours seemed to go so slowly for the sorcerer. He was 
not looking forward to meeting with his master. Archbishop Lazarus 
was not known for handling failure in an underling very well. Mardran 
had considered just vanishing, but he feared Lazarus enough to decide 
that facing the evil one would be better done now than sometime in 
the future. Now he still had an opportunity to correct his failure 
and perhaps redeem himself in Lazarus's eyes. At least he hoped that 
could do so.
	He could not understand how he and his band of cutthroats had been 
defeated by a couple of rogues. Had he allowed them all to become too 
complacent during the journey? He believed that they had killed the 
young warrior and the great wolf who had attacked them when they 
captured the girl. Mardran was second guessing himself on how he 
handled the task assigned by the Archbishop  because he was 
considered one the Lazarus's most trusted subordinates. Lazarus had 
turned to him on so many occasions to handle very important quests 
that involved pleasing the Dark Lord. The Archbishop feared Diablo 
and not successfully accomplishing a task set forth by the evil one 
was a sure means to a painful horrible death for all involved.
	The air was getting heavier and warmer as he proceeded along the 
passage and the choking smell of sulfur was beginning to burn his 
eyes. How he hated coming down here! Why couldn't Lazarus just 
utilize the church as his headquarters. At least Mardran could 
continue to breath clean and cool air when paying one of these visits 
to the Archbishop.
	Sometimes Lazarus seemed far too melodramatic to Mardran, like he 
had to demonstrate his vile and horrific deeds in a ten-fold display 
of terror. Mardran had often wondered why Lazarus didn't just kill 
his victims instead of all of the formality of the sacrifices.  
	But now his worry was that of informing the Archbishop that the girl 
he had wanted so badly as a sacrifice had escaped. 
	Lazarus might just kill him, he wasn't sure.
	Mardran was so engrossed in thought that he was taken completely by 
surprise when he ran directly into a tall, black clad knight.
	The force of the collision nearly voided Mardran's lung of air. The 
man stood over seven feet tall and the heavy black plate he wore 
added a tremendous amount of force to the collision. The impact 
tossed the sorcerer  a few feet into the  wall. He was bent down 
trying to re-capture his breath when he heard a familiar voice.
	&#34;Mardran, you old goat. What are you doing slinking through 
these corridors? Shouldn't Laz's fair-haired boy be sitting beside  
his master!&#34; roared the voice.
	Mardran looked up to see the face of Naden, staring at him though 
his great helm.
	&#34;Are you lost?&#34; Naden asked.
	&#34;No, I'm not lost!&#34; Mardran replied directly. &#34;Right now 
I have no time to stop and chat with you!&#34;
	&#34;I thought you were on some very important quest for the 
master&#34; Naden didn't seem to hear or at least didn't acknowledge 
what Mardran had said. &#34;Didn't you take some of your mercenaries 
with you?&#34;
	Mardran had already grown weary of this encounter and curtly 
replied, &#34;Yes.&#34;
	He then turned and continued his search for Lazarus. He could still 
hear the warrior asking him questions as he disappeared from sight 
down the passageway.
	Within a few minutes he had reached the door to Archbishop Lazarus's 
chamber.
	He paused to gather his thoughts. As he did so the doors swung open 
and four of the Archbishop's guards exited carrying what appeared to 
be the body of an Iron Death. Mardran couldn't be certain, the armor 
was merely a twisted charred heap of metal. An arm hung from one side 
of the heap, a clue as to what this might have been before.
	From within the chamber he could hear the Archbishop's voice. He was 
screaming loudly enough that he might be heard in Tristram. Someone 
or something had provoked Lazarus into a rage. As he stood in the 
doorway, Mardran saw Lazarus turn to an advisor who appeared to be 
attempting to get the Archbishop's attention. Well he got it, in the 
form a massive fireball that struck him exactly in the center of his 
chest and exploded outwardly from there. Within a second the man was 
completely consumed by the flame and only a couple of charred pieces 
of armor remained. As Lazarus turned, Mardran could see fire 
emanating from his eyes.
	&#34;Mardran!!&#34; shouted the Archbishop, &#34;finally some good 
news after dealing with all of these buffoons!! Bring me that 
girl!!&#34;
	Mardran gulped hard.
