<pre>hey, i hate these posts as much as you guys, but i still
need evidence.  this was my 2 last post
that i did earier, read it, and THEN decide if you want
to sign the petition.  and if you decide to sign, please
tell me why you are so sure you have the right guy.

 if  talon was the one that did this, then ban him, but i have
 seen absolutely no evidence that it was him yet.  the host
 was actually the same one as theman has.  
 
 although talon hates you guys i am not so fast to suspect 
 him.  the way i see it, you would have to be a pretty
 decent hacker to change your host to something else,
 and from the posts of talon that i have read, he doesn't
 seem like he is past the 3rd grade yet.
 
 it also seems that the writing style of these posts are not 
 the same as talon.  have you read any of talon's posts?
 he can't even speak english!  the real talon makes a lot
 of simple gramatical errors, things which are not present
 in this post.  talon has serious problems with his tense
 errors, similar to what you might hear from a nonnative
 speaker.  although this post has several minor errors,
 these errors are not characteristic of talon's writing.
 
 
 so far, the only evidence i have that this is talon's
 writing is the fact that his enemy accused him.  now,
 why would his enemy accused him, and try to get him
 banned?
 
 i am not saying that talon was not the one who did it,
 i am simply not going to join in on this damn witchhunt.
 um, i don't know where you all live, but in MY country,
 people are innocent until proven guilty. 
 
 i urge you guys to actually try to do some investigation
 before you all join in on this great crusade to ban a 
 disgusting person.  it seems like you guys read a disgusting
 post, and you are out for revenge, even if you get back
 at the wrong person.  one guy, who is talon's enemy,
 accused it was him, and then EVERYONE assumed he 
 was right.  remember, just cuz someone is accused
 doesn't mean he did it.
 
 the only piece of evidence i see is the HOST name, and
 this piece of evidence actually points towards theman, 
 not talon.  i'll assume this can be hacked, but i just don't
 think talon seems smart enough to do something like this.
 i honestly think that it was done by someone else.   
 
 i don't want to be closed minded about this, so if you
 can show me any evidence, please post it or email me.
 if i think the evidence is sound, i will add my name
 to this petition.

&#62;       SnowRabbit was walking along the country side.
&#62; 
&#62;       SnowR: La la la..
&#62;       Then a bunch of guys appeared on his path.
&#62;       Fluffy-Bunny:  Hey snow, giveme yo money, or I kill you.
&#62;       SnowR:  What?...No, I don't have any money!!
&#62;       FluffyB: he he he...Morphine time!
&#62;       Fluffy and his friends morphed into a god-mode, injecting 
&#62; morphine 
&#62;       into themselves.
&#62; 
&#62;       SnowR:  Please don't beat me, I'm INFERNO you know.
&#62;       FluffyB:  We don't care a shit...
&#62;       SnowR:  Fist, Tracy help!! I need help!!  (crying out for his 
&#62; buddies)
&#62; 
&#62;       Mean while in INFERNO central..

&#62;       distress!!!  Tracy, ONLY we can help him!!

&#62; the gramatical errors in the suspected imposter
&#62; seem like mistakes that are actually american slang.
&#62; &#34;gime yo money,&#34; and, &#34;i don't care a shit&#34; are 
&#62; gramatical
&#62; errors more common in native speakers.
&#62; 
&#62; from the old post, it seems like talon is not a native
&#62; speaker.  i think some of you might not have heard many
&#62; non-native speakers, but i have, and the old talon seems
&#62; to have many of the same types of gramatical errors.
&#62; 
&#62; oh, by the way, i was wrong, talon DOES have the ability
&#62; to hack his host name, but that means someone else
&#62; could have also done it to frame him.
&#62; 
&#62; well, show me i'm wrong, and i will add my name.
&#62; 
&#62;                                                Urfriend
&#62; 
&#62; too talon, if you did it, Phook-off!  if you didn't, i am gonna
&#62; have to demand a fee for being your laywer.

i have nothing against theman, but you all know how good
he is at turning large crowds against people.  he did it
to several members of his own clan and got them kicked
out.  i just ask you to think before you sign this petition.
but just don't blindly follow people's lead.  and don't let
your anger for this disgusting post lead you to convict a 
man(boy?) who may just as likely be innocent.</pre>
