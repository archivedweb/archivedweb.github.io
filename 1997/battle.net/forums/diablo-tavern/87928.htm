<blockquote>
<pre>Of Beginnings
Part One

	“But Father-”
	“Don’t you ‘But Father’ me, Oltor! I fathered you to be a warrior, 
not a scribe!” 
	Oltor Na’Fessa looked down at his delicate, long-fingered hands. He 
was a gangly youth, and the dark skin was smooth and hairless, 
enhancing the appearance of fragility. He sighed. He had tried to 
explain that he may have been fathered to be a warrior, but he was 
not born to be one.
	Unfortunately, this did not agree with his fathers’ plans to climb 
the social ladder. Already a merchant of great wealth, Thrak Na’Fessa 
was still shunned by the court for his lack of status. Oltor was the 
only child to be born of his loins in two score years, and his father 
was not about to pass up the chance to further his own designs. 
Warrior sons brought much respect and status.
	“Beginning tomorrow, you will train under the White Devil - he is 
the premier gladiator of the arena, and I have accrued much status by 
means of his purchase.” (It went without saying that the gladiator 
was a slave - who would willingly risk his life for the crowd?)
	Oltor sighed under his breath. It was no use arguing.
	“As you wish, Father.” his head bowed submissively.
	“As it should be.” Thrak’s features relaxed into what would have 
been a smile on any well-favoured face, and he clapped a thick hand 
to his son’s shoulder, staggering him. The heavyset merchant turned 
and strode from the ascetic chamber that served as his son’s only 
room.
	Familiar feelings washed over the young man - guilt, frustration, 
loneliness. They came to him comfortingly, like old friends. A single 
bitter tear rose hesitantly in one eye, before being blinked away 
angrily. He felt that something was wrong with his family - some 
fundamental flaw that must explain all the tension and heartache. But 
for the life of him, he could not think what it might be.
	He turned from the door and his fathers’ retreating form, seeking 
solace in the only place he knew - between the heavy parchment pages 
of one of his prized books.

	It was only a few weeks ago that he had stumbled across the first 
tome, while browsing through the shelves of an ancient shop he had 
discovered. A brief haggle, and the book was his for a paltry sum. 
Careful not to let his father find it, he had smuggled it home.
	Late that evening, by the light of a guttering candle, he read the 
last few words on the final page, and closed the mottled cover. His 
eyes bright with wonder and glazed with weariness, he pondered the 
meaning of the ancient text. It spoke of powers beyond those of 
mortal men. Of magic arts, the power of the mind, and of the very 
stuff of life - Mana.
	From that day onward, he had sought and obtained several archaic 
volumes of eldritch lore - many things he learnt about the 
disciplines and arts. His most recent purchase - of that very day - 
was a slim tome, bound in red leather. His fingers tingled as he 
touched the cover, and he knew that at last he had found his first 
spellbook.

	He had barely a chance to hide his new discovery upon his return 
before being confronted by his father. And now it seemed that he 
would never have the freedom to study his newfound passion. His 
father had ruled that he would be a warrior, and he knew that he 
would not be able to sway him.
	Well, for this one night he would do as he pleased.
	He placed the book reverently upon his desk, and lit several of the 
fat candles that were placed advantageously about the room. Returning 
to his chair, he seated himself and drew the tome before him. The 
welcoming feel of the soft leather caressed his fingertips, bringing 
them alive with the feel of magic.
	Breathing in deeply, he focused inwards as he had learnt, bringing 
his concentration to a peak. He let go of his fear of the morrow, and 
his despite of the warrior life that he was to begin. Slowly opening 
his eyes, he looked down, and opened the book. He read the first 
words of the ancient Horadrim book, translating them as he read...
	“Aye treatise upon the proper casting of the spell known as 
Firebolt...”</pre>
