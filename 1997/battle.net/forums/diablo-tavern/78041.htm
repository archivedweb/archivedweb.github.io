&#62; Well, i've finally come to the conclusion that Diablo sucks.   The 
&#62; game itself is friggin awesome, but the manner in playing it on 
&#62; battle.net is the culprit.  Blizzard, forget about starcraft.  You 
&#62; are creating something that will be a flop.  Log on to battle.net 
&#62; sometime (if you can actually get on and stay on), look at the number 
&#62; of people online when you get in a chat channel, and guarantee 
&#62; yourself that this is the number of people that won't buy starcraft.  
&#62; 
&#62; There is no way that I or any of my friends will buy another Blizzard 
&#62; game because of the rampant disregard for your &#34;honest&#34; 
&#62; customers.  The only answer there is, is to wait for Ultima Online.  
&#62; When UO comes out, give it a week, then log back on battle.net and 
&#62; see just how many people are online.  Maybe then, and only then, will 
&#62; you realize that you made a BIG mistake keeping the character files 
&#62; on the PC not the server.  I would gladly pay the extra bucks to know 
&#62; I can play 99.9&#37; cheat free.
&#62; 
[clipped text not relevant to answer]

I agree with this. I will not purchase starcraft as I have witnessed 
and been harrassed by cheaters and hackers. I have to believe that 
the stand on cheating, hacking and duping in diablo will be brought 
over into starcraft. I don't mind if someone wants to cheat unless it 
flows over into my game. This includes when a cheating player comes 
into my game with an AA apoc staff with 255 charges and then proceeds 
to kill everything within range not allowing me one experience point. 
This in my opinion affects my game play. I also will wait for UO</pre>
