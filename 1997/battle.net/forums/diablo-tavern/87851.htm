<pre>The Light is Dimmed

Chapter One:

	Only moonlight shone on the ruins of the once magnificent hall of 
Ordo Rosae. Gone were the days of laughter and friendship. And gone 
were the days when the Ordo upheld all the righteous edicts of 
mankind. Nothing hinted of the glory that was once Ordo Rosae 
Moriatur. All was forgotten. The teachings of this church, the 
kindness of its people, and the horrible events that transpired only 
200 years ago.
	The clouds broke the deafening silence with a thunderclap. Sounding 
the approach of a hooded rider. The rider, with steed, moved slowly. 
Not paying the slightest attention to the evident thunderstorm. 
Arriving at the gate of the Ordo, the rider dismounted and walked 
slowly into the church's grounds. The rain came then, soaking the 
cloaked figure as it walked towards the battered entrance to the 
foyer. Ignoring the rain as if were a breeze, the Dark One escaped 
into the hall. 
	The black robed figure walked into what was left of the church. Ever 
so softly this black shadow walked down the halls of the temple. 
Gazing to its side, it found a worn fabric symbol of a dying rose. 
Recognizing this symbol, the creature put its hand forth, and 
caressed it. Retracting its hand from the symbol, the dark figure 
grabbed its head, shrieking in pain. The Dark One blacked-out, and 
collapsed onto the floor.

	&#34;Dahmson….&#34;
	&#34;Dahmson….&#34;
	&#34;Wake up Dahmson!&#34; shouted a familiar voice. &#34;Its time 
to leave for the highlands.&#34; Opening her eyes, the Paladin 
Dahmson-Ree, saw her friends Norkund and Red-Falcon. The two men 
helped her up and started to walk away. The two stopped when the 
young woman finally said something. &#34;Ah, what a great day. How, 
long have you two been up?&#34; She looked over her surroundings of 
forest and plains and  glanced back to her companions. Who, in 
response, turned away from her and began to walk slowly down the 
trail. The paladin put on her armor and strapped a beautifully shined 
bastard sword to her back. Running to catch up with her counterparts, 
young Dahmson started questioning the two. &#34;Why are you two in 
such a hurry? We have until sundown to reach the mountain village of  
Diamond Lake. We didn't even have breakfast yet.&#34; Looking at her 
companions, Dahmson laughed and said, &#34;I've never seen you two 
guys so ready to go!&#34;
	Red-Falcon slowly turned back and stuttered a few words, &#34;Uh, 
Dahmson, I'm not really that hungry this morning, let us skip 
breakfast&#34; Norkund laughed and interjected, &#34;Yeah of course 
you're not hungry, Red!&#34; Norkund stopped and laughed some more. 
In an instant, Red-Falcon's face lit up bright red.  Quickly he 
yelled at Norkund, &#34;You better not, you conniving little 
devil!&#34; Just then Red-Falcon took a small swipe at Norkund's 
head. Missing, Norkund ran further up the trail and turned to face 
his assailant. Once again, Norkund broke into a fit of laughter. 
Dahmson watching all of this, questioned the source of Norkund's 
amusement. Norkund barely speaking clearly stumbled out, &#34;If you 
would really like to know my lady,&#34; Red-Falcon, upon hearing 
this, shook his head and ran up the trail after Norkund. Norkund 
slowly walked backward but continued, &#34;My lady, have you not seen 
the sun?&#34; He tripped and fell onto the dirt trail, &#34;It isn't 
morning. It is only a few small hours until sunset! Red fell asleep 
at his post and woke up around noon! Ha!&#34;
	Unfortunately, the hand of Red-Falcon, reached the sly jester. Red 
sent a barrage of curses at Norkund, not forgetting a one. The 
Paladin, only laughed and smiled at this site. Giggling softly, she 
put her hand on Red's shoulder and said, &#34;It's alright my 
friend.&#34; Red, all of a sudden, stopped, wiped his brow, and 
started laughing at the situation. Laughing hard herself, Ree 
continued, &#34;It was a nice try though Red. Don't worry about 
it.&#34; Dahmson composed herself and continued, &#34;We shall then 
get there by tomorrow. It's not a problem at all. Norkund will guard 
tonight.&#34;
	Eventually, composing themselves, the three lone adventurers resumed 
their journey to the mountain village. 
	And the next morning, Norkund was found fast asleep at his post, 
when the others woke up around noon.
     
Chapter two:

	Coldness and death, it was all that was left of the Ordo. The 
cloaked one, writhed on the stone floor in pain at what it just saw. 
It felt malice at the joy of the young girl and her companions. 
Regaining itself, the shadow dropped back to a defensive stance from 
the tapestry, as if protecting itself from an unseen assailant. 
&#34;Never again.&#34; It whispered. &#34;Your petty magic will not 
work on me. I know you all too well.&#34;  The Dark One then simply 
turned, and walked from the decaying hallway.
	The next room the dark rider entered, was that of an eating hall. 
Once grand in nature, this hall was now desecrated. Filth, dirt, and 
unknown muck covered the floor as if it were a parasite. The cloaked 
one glanced up to the cavernous roof and a raindrop assaulted its 
vision. Disgusted with the petty annoyance, it moved to a dry place 
and glanced about the hall. Nothing moved. The only sound was that of 
an occasional drip of water from the leaky roof. Still, the Dark One 
felt insecure in this room of nothingness. It felt that something was 
soon to happen. 
And, ironically, it did. Suddenly everything was restored. Back to 
the beauty it possessed 200 years ago. Violently, the shadow drew 
itself back and glanced about wildly like a frightened animal. The 
tables were set for dinner, and the grandeur of the hall was once 
more. Not noticing the black shadow, the members of the Ordo were 
rushing in and out, preparing for some sort of meal. Life, once again 
filled this hall. And, once again, something tormented this shadow's 
peace. The Dark One stood frozen, fearing the slightest movement 
would end its existence. All it did, was watch. Watch the circus of 
movement, it found repulsive, unfolding before its eyes. 
   
	A lone figure strode unnoticed into the eating hall of Ordo Rosae 
Moriatur. Most preoccupied with eating their meals, this person stood 
at the head of the table for a little while and sat down. Looking 
down at her plate of  assorted foods, she began to eat slowly. Much 
was on her mind. The woman put down her fork and stroked a gold 
amulet of a dying rose, the symbol of Ordo Rosae Moriatur. She 
resumed eating and quietly pondered. Day-dreaming about friends, 
acquaintances, and others. Many thoughts danced through her mind. She 
had such a heavy burden to carry. So much had changed from when she 
was just a peasant girl. And now, this young woman was leading a 
large band of heroes and adventures, all striving for peace and 
harmony in Tristram. She thought she could face the responsibility by 
herself. She muddled with her food a bit, and smiled as she thought 
how wrong she was. Now, she has close friends that help her in any 
way she needs it. She almost cried at the love she felt from her 
friends. She almost broke down with joy when she remembered Red-
Falcon's jokes, Hyleyn's innocence, and Dahmson-Ree's loyalty. Frylia 
Wintersbreath stopped eating and just sat there, remembering the 
memories she once had.
	&#34;Frylia, are you well?&#34; a lone voice startled her reverie.
Lady Frylia quickly snapped awake. &#34;Oh, it's you Dahmson.&#34; 
Shifting rather uneasily Frylia continued, &#34;I am doing well, I 
guess. Dahmson could you please join me in my study?&#34; 
The paladin knew something was wrong. She saw it in Frylia's face. 
When in Frylia's study, Dahmson spoke softly to her leader. 
&#34;Frylia, what is the matter my friend? You look very distressed, 
to me. Please, tell me of your troubles.&#34; The guildmistress 
showed a slight smile and stroked her precious Ordo amulet. Dahmson 
watched on as her close confidant's face slowly saddened, &#34;Why 
are you always here for me, Dahmson?&#34; Frylia shed a single 
teardrop and continued unsteadily, &#34;Even in these times of 
trouble for the Ordo, you are still here.&#34; Frylia regained 
herself, and continued, &#34;Well, as you now know, the Alignment 
will come to pass in only two days. It seems that the final battle 
with Diablo is now at hand.&#34;
Dahmson nodded slowly and said, &#34;I know, my friend, and I am here 
for you.&#34;
Frylia strolled her fingers along the bookcase of her study. Nothing 
finding her interest, she once again turned to her paladin. &#34;I'm 
just so afraid, Dahmson.&#34;. Still keeping her composure, Frylia 
went on, &#34;So many will die, and I can't save them.&#34; Biting 
her lip, Frylia continued, &#34;Overall, I'm so afraid to loose the 
people who have meant so much to me.&#34; Putting her head in her 
hands, Frylia wept. Dahmson knew only too well how Frylia felt. And 
now, all Dahmson could do was hold her friend, and cry with her.

             The black shadow watched the vision of the two and 
laughed softly to itself, &#34;That day Frylia wept for reasons that 
Dahmson knew not,&#34; The vision of the women then dissipated. And 
the hall was restored to the death and decay the shadow welcomed. 
&#34;In actuality,&#34; the Dark One said, &#34;Lady Frylia was 
weeping for what she knew was going to happen to her friends.&#34; 
The Dark One simply smiled at the thought, and faded back into the 
halls of the church.
