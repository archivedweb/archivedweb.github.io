<pre>I don't expect to make a habit out of responding to Eugene's posts 
since I personally find them... well, nevermind what i think, but I 
feel compelled to write this time around.

&#62; Cheater and PKiller.. main difference is that PK is way of playing a 
&#62; game which includes competition.. if you sweep PK and cheaters in 
&#62; smae pile your so called researches(which I higly doubt exist at all) 
&#62; worth exactly half of false penny..... wait... I wouldn't even pay it 
&#62; for it.. congratulations with wasted time!!!!

I'm not sure where you're going with this.  I don't recall anything 
remotely resembling comparisons between cheaters and PKs in Kinjin's 
post.

&#62; here you go:
&#62; 
&#62; Tere are TWO magor groups of players:
&#62; Cheaters and NONcheaters(according to ONE description)
&#62; 
&#62; PKillers and Coopers....
&#62; 
&#62; Cheaters with nnoncheaters are about 15:1 .. i.e about 15 people use 
&#62; backups and duped items along with hacks and third party programs for 
&#62; each ONE noncheating player....
&#62; 
&#62; PKillers with Coopers(which includes cheaters) are about 1:5 where 
&#62; are their own separations..
&#62; 
&#62; anyway I prefer using forst system whch breaks people on chaters and 
&#62; noncheaters:
&#62; 
&#62; among NONcheaters there are 1:50 PKiller/cooper thingy.. why is it so 
&#62; low??? Because legit and masterfull PK is rare thing... I am talking 
&#62; about Diablo.... as you may notice among cheaters PK rate is much 
&#62; higher.... because they have nothing to do... game is way too easy.. 
&#62; but they still cannot be mixed with PKillers... they are same 
&#62; dumbasses with you (Coopers) who just way to bored with ruined game..

I'll just assume the stats you put up are researched.  

&#62; About PKilling in UO:
&#62; 
&#62; PKilling in UO is a bit different issue.. PKillers are divided on 3 
&#62; categories:
&#62; 
&#62; bad notoriety kills only
&#62; Facultative PK
&#62; Real PK
&#62; 
&#62; First ones are killing ONLY people who due to UO design are 
&#62; outlaws... they usualy got their bad notoriety off some MOnster 
&#62; ramble... and are usually coopers... so first ones are pretty much 
&#62; chikenshit anyway
&#62; 
&#62; Second are about as immature as it gets... they don't usually PK, but 
&#62; are eager for dogooding... I enjy wasting them in packs...
&#62; 
&#62; THird are usually expirienced and dedicated players.. who actually 
&#62; ROLEPLAY evil character in UO.... due to knowleges and abilities they 
&#62; usually have positive notoriety(I am usually Hnorable or Lord) and 
&#62; they PK mostly people based on Equipment or just likeness... I love 
&#62; killing Noble lords.... now....

Somewhere in here I am getting the sense you are equating co-ops with 
bad skills.  What prompts this?  Are you seriously saying that all co-
ops are skill-less, and therefore co-op?  Where did you get this 
assumption?  So if they were skillful enough, surely they'd be PKs?  
Come on...

&#62; I doubt U EVER met any real PKillers in either Diablo or UO, because 
&#62; all your arguments seem just broad generalizations derived from dumb 
&#62; stereotipe &#34;coopers&#34; created for themselves in order to 
&#62; justify fact that they suck in Online games...:

Read above.  Talk about putting everyone in one category...

&#62; &#34;PK are no lifers and this is why they always beat us 
&#62; intoground... we have life and we are so darn sucessfull in RL, we 
&#62; have no time left for playing game .. we mostly chat exchanging our 
&#62; amasement as how good and cool we are&#34;

Again you assume that all co-ops suck and all they do is chat.  Where 
is this assumption coming from?  I hardly ever chat in B.Net or UO, 
and I'm sure majority are playing games, not chatting.  Even the 
&#34;lame&#34; co-ops.

&#62; Now.... as U can actually see above is pile of BS.... they suck 
&#62; because they are NOT smart enough, not flexible enoug or/and spend 
&#62; too much time in chats whining and cussing PKillers... most of 
&#62; coopers spend about TWICE time online compare to me or some other 
&#62; PoCs... but what they do???? CHAT.... I PLAY..... Zudini??? he he 
&#62; eh.. ohh well....
&#62; 
&#62; anyway... your brioad and pretty much pathetic generalizations of 
&#62; what you THINK about PKillers show how little you know about people 
&#62; who PLAY online games.... go chat dude... there is NOTHING in game 
&#62; for you..... go to bars,.... U can talk to people there!

Both Serena and Kinjin put up a post of a little survey they (or 
someone they knew) did, that's all.  Granted, it was somewhat laden 
with anti-PK sentiments, but it was what they found in their research 
nevertheless.  It was fairly objective, and as a non-PK who has no 
problems with legit PKs, I tend to think the results make sense in 
general.  IN GENERAL.  Perhaps you and some others are radically out 
of the mold that they described, but IN GENERAL, that is what they 
found.  If you have done a similar survey, and have found different 
results, then you are more than welcome to post it.  But it doesn't 
make any sense for you to flame anyone with the kind of berating you 
have done.
