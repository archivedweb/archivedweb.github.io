&#62; Sigh.  If anyone wants to know, Acidic left INFERNO because he didn't 
&#62; have a &#34;unit&#34; under his control.  He felt that he was being 
&#62; left out.  I told him on SEVERAL occasions that we are going to wait 
&#62; until the beta before we do anything else.  For some reason he thinks 
&#62; there is actually power involved in being a unit commander, when all 
&#62; they do is help get people organized.  Why make plans for a game that 
&#62; isn't going to be out until the fall?  Yes, the full version of 
&#62; Ultima isn't going to be out until August or September.  Why make 
&#62; plans for a game that NONE of them have even played?  Sure, we can 
&#62; get ourselves organized, recruit people, but that is really all.  
&#62; Now, seeing how you have formed this guild for over a month, I have 
&#62; no choice but to declare you an enemy.  Your Power Hungry ways has 
&#62; corrupted other fools who wish to follow you.  You were a cheater in 
&#62; Diablo, someone who needed an edge in pking.  You were kicked out of 
&#62; INFERNO because of this cheating.  Then you started grasping for 
&#62; imaginary power.  You have failed to realize  that all INFERNO are 
&#62; just a band of PK.  Now, you try to stab us in the back.  
&#62; Congratulations, you are our first declared enemy for UO, and you are 
&#62; going to have to die.  Too anyone who follows him, acidic is a power 
&#62; hungry fool.  Now he has all the power he wanted, his own leader.  
&#62; Watch yourselfs.  It is good we you are coming  forward, we don't 
&#62; want people like you in INFERNO.  We only want dedicated people, who 
&#62; understand that INFERNO is nothing more than a bunch of PKs who are 
&#62; friends.  You are nothing more than a 15 year old kid who cheated in 
&#62; Diablo.  Good ridance.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Code Myster:  you are a fool.  I won't even go into how you use god 
&#62; mode to kill pks, however MK is monster kill.  There is no cheating 
&#62; involved, it is when you res someone you pked when their corpse is 
&#62; surrounded by monsters, or you 'help' damage them when they are in 
&#62; combat with monsters to 'assist' in their death.  Thus, they drop all 
&#62; their stuff when dead.  Blah, go away now.
