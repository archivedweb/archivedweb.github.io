<pre>Of COURSE Pking is Wrong!

Give this dead topic some peace. Pking is as &#34;wrong&#34; as it 
gets in Diablo. Would you like to lose your hard earned money and 
items to some jackass with a complex?  

Only reason people pk--and none of this bullshit about 
&#34;skill,&#34; cause dueling is definitely more challenging than 
stabbing someone in the back while they're surrounded by monsters--is 
cause they want to make someone else suffer, take out their basest 
urgest they can't express in real life.

Quit deluding yourselves.  Pking belongs in Quake, not in Diablo 
where people spend months playing legitly, or even for dupers, many 
weeks having fun raising their characters.  The only reason people 
are condoning pk these days is because cheating has taken the 
limelight off it.

Pk was the first original sin of Diablo.  Duping was next. As a pker, 
co-oper, legit (once upon a time), and a hacker, I know from personal 
experience, as well as from personalities I've gotten to knnow, pking 
IS without a doubt malicious and unethical.  Blizzard may have 
intended for this to be in the game, but they did not stop to 
consider that this is merely another way for people to disbehave and 
act in a purely anti-civil manner.

Civilization is nothing without order and an acknowledgement of 
other's rights--and equally means nothing when people decide it's ok 
to &#34;role-play&#34; and break these rules of common conduct that 
apply in all circumstances.  Even on the internet.

Stop deluding yourselves and accept that you're all animals, those of 
you in here who keep justifying pking as &#34;part of the game.&#34;  
It isn't a part of civilzed human nature.  And denying it (and I 
certainly won't deny my nature) marks you out for an even graver sin--
hypocrisy.
