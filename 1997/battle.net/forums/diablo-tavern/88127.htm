<pre>Wiseman, and others (I guess),

The unusual thing about your post, Wiseman, was that the first 
thought that came to my mind was home.

Not too many of you probably know too much about Cincinnati, OH, or 
even more specifically, Clifton.  The University of Cincinnati, where 
I'm currently going to school, sits right in the middle of Clifton.  
To sum it up, Clifton is a hole.  I hope I didn't offend anybody.  
But I walk 4 or 5 city blocks to campus, walking over broken glass, 
ducking under tree branches, watching out for the part of the 
sidewalk that has been missing for as long as I've lived here, wave 
to the colored elderly man that always sits on his porch, nod to the 
lady on the porch next to his as I look past the Christmas lights 
still decorating the house, and walk down the hill to campus....  

...a campus that is currently just a big wooden wall with bulldozers 
and whatnot dragging dust everywhere.  The entire campus has about as 
many trees as I have fingers and toes.  All and all the campus is an 
eye sore.

I could write a five hundred page book about the ignorance of UC, 
from the library that was built with out accounting for the weight of 
the books to the pastel colored architecture building without a right 
angle anywhere in it.  But I will not.

Day in and day out this kind of thing gets old, so I fill the old 
tank up with gas and embark on my 120 mile treck to the small town of 
Coldwater, OH every once in a while.  I take old 75 north a ways and 
turn when I think I'm in the middle of nowhere, and a half an hour 
later I'm there.  

Well, what the hell is out there?  Nothing.  It's great.  There is no 
pollution, no traffic, no maniac psycho triple lane changers, and no 
crime save the under age drinkers (and we have a bunch of those).  
Everyone needs to go to these places once in a while, and when these 
places don't exist anymore, we use our military power capable of 
blowing up the world twenty times over, and punch out the old time 
clock.

And my contribution to all of this will be a drop in an ocean of 
technology that will eventually turn us all into Gods, or die trying. 
 Either way, we lose.  I'm not being negative about this, it is just 
that dying doesn't appear to be too much fun, and having the power to 
call ourselves God doesn't seem to exciting to me. &#60;yawn&#62;

I'll tell you this:  In just about everything we do all the fun is 
getting there.  So whatever ends up happening to us, death or 
immortality or both, the idea is to get the most out of this crazy 
parade.

Now back to my regularly scheduled bit rearrangement....
