&#62; i joined 20 games this monrning you want to know how many had

&#62; not know because they made a game just to dupe and the other was emty 
&#62; so it was poblliy a ghost. So 19 out of 20 games have cheaters.  What 
&#62; does that say?                         TO MANY DAMN 
&#62; CHEATERS!!!Cheaters are ruining the game i once loved.            -

I would have to agree on you on that one their's to many cheater's 
they are ruininig battle.net its getting harder to player kill now a 
day's just yesterday i only grabbed my self 2 ear's in one night :(   
 and i usally get more than that i tryed killing this one mage named 
Master what a fool i killed another mage and right when i was gonna 
attack him he put on god mode and almost got me lucky for me i got my 
teleport spell and saved my a** he said i used god mode too his hit 
points were not going down and mine were i player kill the legit way 
and show people my stuff from a distance to show i am legit i have a 
saintly plate of stars armor 121&#37; 9+ to all i got a crown of 
star's 11+ to all i got a eagle horn bow , and a strannge bow of 
heavens and i got a grandfather sword and a  amulet of jade zodiac 
which i found and a ect. which goes to show u i dont cheat dam 
cheaters out there i curse u fools why dont u go back to jacking off 
or whatever it was before u got on to playing diablo u suk god mode 
sux hackeed weopons suk dupeing sux ect...... i'am getting sick and 
tired of it this must stop see player killing was built in the game 
so their was no stopping that but the cheating to get an ear and usin 
high tech weopons to get the job done show's how much skill u got u 
cant player kill without u'r precious cheats and hacked items cause u 
now if u didnt have them u would lose if u tryed to kill anyone i 
kill with a passion and with kill the legitmate way and i'am very 
good at it exept agains a god moder who so willing denies he has it 
on u cheater's and hackers have no honor in my book *Evil Grin* and 
i'am taking into consideration not to player kill anymore why bother 
with it i was incouraged by Set also known as Anubisan why even 
bother everyone uses god mode the hell with it i might as well retire 
i'll stick to having a good chat or co-op game later all Hail INFERNO
