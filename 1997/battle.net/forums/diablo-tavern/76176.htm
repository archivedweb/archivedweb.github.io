Hey, Flux (aka Fai-Yen)

You remember me from a few hours ago? We were in Snakegod channel, 
and you (as Fai-Yen, low level rogue) asked for a game. I joined, 
(Fool, level 3 Sorcerer).
I suspected something when I saw a rogue running around with a sword 
instead of a bow. Bottom of the Church stairs, BAM I was dead. I 
restarted in town.The dialogue went something like this:

&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: how was that?
&#60;Fool&#62;: how was what?
&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: the kill
&#60;Fool&#62;: so so
&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: Eugene would kill for that
&#60;Fool&#62;: you already did
&#60;Fool&#62;: so who are you really?
&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: guess who I am
&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: I am an INFERNO leader
&#60;Fool&#62;: nuh uh. I asked first.
&#60;Fai-Yen&#62;: okay. Im flux

I then proceeded to enlighten you as to style in Pkilling, stating 
that you should use a bow if you wanted to be inconspicuous, to which 
you replied that you preferred being loud. You went on about how you 
killed &#34;cheesy creamer&#34; (I assume you meant Easy-
Dreamer/Possum) lots, he seemed to enjoy it. You said you were a 
sadist.

Then the good bit:

You asked me if I wanted to help you practice pking.
Sure, why not. But first, I asked that you post about it on ogden's 
once we were done, to which you said okay. Where's the post?

Also, after you killed me a few more times, I lay there rather than 
restart. You started swinging an axe over my corpse. I nearly fell 
out of my chair laughing. Then you started going on about how with 
your &#60;insert prefix which provides +100 something to hit&#62; 
sword of slaughter and YOUR GNARLED ROOTS, you could hit through AC 
500.

Want to tell me again how you don't cheat? Let's see that quote again:

&#62; 
&#62; let's start off with the fact that i don't cheat
&#62; and let's move on to the fact that u do..
&#62; 

Wow. So Flux is a liar as well as a cheater. I wont go on about 
style, because you obviously don't care. I'll just leave you with 
your own words again;

&#62; loser</pre>
