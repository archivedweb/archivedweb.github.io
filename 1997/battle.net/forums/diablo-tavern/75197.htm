<blockquote>
<pre>I would just like to address the topics of conversation in the 
Snakegod channel. Today and tonight the Snakegod Hall witnessed some 
of the worst drivel it has ever seen. I can't believe, in retrospect, 
that I sat and listened to all the racism, ignorance, and angry 
flaming that went on. Now, I have been known, at times, to boot 
lamers en masse simply for their topic of conversation, and have 
drawn some heat for that. What some people fail to understand, 
however, is that the Snakegod channel is the _rightful_ property of 
the members of the Snakegod Clan, and as such we have the right to 
moderate the chat therein. Often not only does the riffraff come in 
and force us to listen to pointless, cyclical drivel, they drown out 
the conversation between members, and that is just wrong. The channel 
has seen some great moments, such as the communism discussion 
Crystalion posted about, or the Shakespeare duel Kalya and I engaged 
in last night, or countless nights of humor and laughter. But none of 
those things seem to happen when, shall we say, a certain element 
enters. I expect when I go into the channel to have a good time 
there, not to listen to a bunch of flames and whatnot. So I won't 
speak for anyone else, but if you come in and I have the op, expect 
to be kicked if you don't converse in a positive manner (and remember 
that I'm the fastest gavel in the West =)). I'd rather get a 
reputation as someone who boots everyone out than let the kind of 
horrors go on that did tonight.

Yes, I know, flame away with your comments on what a lame co-op'er I 
am.
