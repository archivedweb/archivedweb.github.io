Dear friend. I believe we met once or twice before our mutual friend 
was slain.
&#62; Hi Thanatos, 
&#62;             Its been such a long time since we last wrote to one 
&#62; another,  are you kinda busy lately?

I remember he did write to you several times, and received little or 
no response right up to the time where his e-mails started to bounce 
back, saying the user was no longer at that address. Perhaps it was a 
broken heart wich was his downfall in the end, but who's to say?


 Seems to me that you quitted 
&#62; writing for some time now or are you preparing for some new stuffs 
&#62; yet?

On Thanatos's behalf, I've posted a couple of stories lately. I have 
almost finished my next one, but have had a severe case of writer's 
block for a couple of weeks now. I think a fair chunk of it needs to 
be re-written, but I'll get it out pretty soon.

&#62; Btw, do you still frequent aus-1, maybe we could get together 
&#62; some day and find out how you are doing lately....

I believe Thanatos's spirit resides in Aus-1 from time to time, but 
mostly he can be heard rattling the chains in the SnakeGod halls.

&#62; 
&#62; Your friend, Z

Thanatos spoke highly of you. Perhaps we can be friends like you and 
he were.
Take care, and perhaps I'll see you around.
