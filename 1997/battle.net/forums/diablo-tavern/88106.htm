<blockquote>
<pre>Most of you may recognise at least one of my names; Wiseman. Many of 
you, of course, may not. Of course, we can forget the name thing. It 
does not really matter who I am, or indeed who any of us are. Well, 
it seems that way. Just a warning - anyone who'll be offended if this 
post isn't really about Diablo better leave now.

Has anyone else ever looked around them while driving through town, 
and seen all the advertising that surrounds us? Has anyone ever 
thought about how much money is spent to ensure that we buy one brand 
of soft drink over another? And how comparitively little we spend on 
education, health care and social security? How much is spent 
researching better ways to kill ourselves?

Why are there great and powerful empires built around things that 
really don’t matter? Has anyone looked at the number of cars passing 
on the street and thought about exactly how much of the worlds 
resources are being wasted on transport? And of course, the 
multinational corporations who strive to ensure that we continue to 
do so, because it is their income at stake?

Am I the only person out of all the people I know that worries about 
the world and the direction the human race is heading? How can I 
presume to say it? What gives me the right to speak?

I feel like I am standing at the bottom of an enormous hole, and I’m 
being told that the sun is shining and it’s a wonderful day. I step 
back and take an objective look at the world, and see that we are 
going to hell. Mankind has ceased to care about each other, and 
ceased to care about our environment. We choose to escape from our 
responsibilities by watching television, or spending endless hours 
attempting to realign electrons in our character information files, 
trying to prove our worth by attaining something that does not really 
exist.

People who think like this can have all their problems solved, and it 
is so easy. You can go to someone, and they will tell you that you 
don’t need to worry about it - that it isn’t your problem. Get some 
rest, take two of these and call me in the morning. And that’ll be 
fifty dollars please.

I have a question though. If it isn’t our problem, then whose problem 
is it?

I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this world, 
you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way to this 
point. I suppose you are reading this because you logged on today, 
looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to have 
disappointed you.

You know what the funniest thing is? I am going to finish writing 
this message, and post it up here, and go home tonight, and waste 
another hour or two of my four score years on realigning electrons in 
my character file. Because while I may be concerned, society has 
taught me I can do nothing about it. I’m only twenty, after all. And 
that makes me a hypocrite in your eyes, because I whine about a 
problem and then choose to ignore it - and so then, once I am safely 
classified in your mind as someone not to listen to, you’ll ignore it 
too, and scroll on to the next post. And we’ll all be happy.

Just a thought. It won’t actually achieve anything except to make me 
feel a little better, but I would appreciate it; if you read this 
entire message, and thought even for a moment about anything I have 
said - waste a post on replying. Let’s see who cares.



Wiseman.</pre>
