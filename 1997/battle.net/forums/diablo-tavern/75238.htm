Yeah, I know.....posting UO info on the Diablo
Forums.....sue me. Just though I would give some
info for the people that might be interested.

First off, it has been announced that the Beta will
be up during the E3 Convention, which takes place
June 19th-21st, so we may be getting the CD's within
2 weeks or less. It was also announced that the Beta
may last up to a month pending on how everything
goes. Hopefully the Beta will last until the Final
is shipped. Still no price set in stone :-(

Second, the UO site has live chat for those of you
who didn't know, which some of the Origin Rep's like
to frequent and answer questions. Below is a direct
quote from one of the chat logs. I'm not against any
good or evil Guild, but I will enjoy reading the
posts following mine:

Statement by Poland: &#34;Is anyone worried that all
of the evil or malevolent guilds will ruin UO for
the average person? We have read and heard that 
many of the evil guilds are planning to band together 
to overrun the game. What I am personally afraid 
of is that we may have to unbalance the game against
such problems (ie: give people with evil notoriety 
more of a disadvantage). We will have writers in the
game world holding public forums to determine the 
impact of the evil guilds, which will be reported in
the newspaper. Bear in mind that the beta test in the 
place to determine such issues and handle them.&#34; 

Well, have fun all :-)
