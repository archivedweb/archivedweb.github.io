<pre>No Kmicic, the events you portrayed were pretty accurate.
I would have had more lines, but I was to busy laughing 
to type!!! Especially when he's walking from cow to cow 
to cow, saying &#34;it didn't work!&#34;.

You did forget to mention that when he came back with his
lvl 1 guy, we acted like we did not know him. He
starts saying &#34;I am Poopy Guy&#34;
This, of course, sent me into more fits of laughter as
kmicic is telling him to put a diaper on!!

Oh, and BTW - thats not a storage char!!! 

The only problem with playin with kmicic, is that he's too 
damn nice!!! I wanted to get poopy into the dungeon with his
new char, and chop him to little bits with my lvl24 warrior.
hey, he joined our &#34;legit only&#34; game wearing hacks. He 
deserved
to die alive die alive die alive die alive die alive die alive
die alive die alive die alive die alive die alive die alive die
alive die alive die alive die alive
as Cronus would say :)

But noooooooooo :)

Ah well, we'll have to do it again sometime ;)

Oh, and remember that one mage who joined with like 1900 hp's?
He says &#34;my real hp's are 234, It just looks like I have a lot
to scare off pk's&#34; HAHAHAHAHHAHAH
I had so much fun, and never even left town!!!

BTW - sorry about not getting back online, RL called, And I could not 
ignore it ;)
