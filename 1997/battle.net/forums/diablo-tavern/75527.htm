<pre>I was sleepless and rather bored after spending some time in Snakegod 
listening to Eugene's usual spiel (indirectly of course -- I squelch 
that hate-spewing geek on sight). I figured what the heck, grabbed my 
newbie-killer (lvl 7 warrior) and went trolling. Well, the first game 
I saw was &#34;legits only&#34;. Yeah, right, I thought, and joined. 
I figured there had to be ONE guy in full plate or some jerk with a 
bazillion HP. That's what had always happened to me when I made a 
game with such a name. My plan was to whack these idiots for crashing 
such a game. 

I joined and there were 2 warriors and 1 wizard (ranging from lvl 1 
to lvl 6) standing in town. None had even chain mail, none had even 
triple-digit HP. 

I then spent a few uncomfortable moments exlaining that my character 
was legit. He had hand-me-down splint mail, which gave him a 
different graphic, and a crown of the lion, which boosted his HP. 
Guess I looked pretty, well, illegit ... So I stood on one side of 
the river and let them look at my stuff. All legit, but indeed too 
powerful for a reasonable coop game (hey I wear it to cut thru that 
GPOW, not whack skellies ...). So I went and made a lvl 1 character, 
transferred nothing and went to work.

It was a BLAST ... a lot like the &#34;good old days&#34; that BLZ 
was talking about. I found a mace of the mind (+3) and the Wiz almost 
cried! Of course one of the warriors (lvl 3) had the bright idea of 
releasing the Butcher. After doing an iron man game with BLZ this 
very same day I was well aware of how foolish this was ... but hey, I 
told him it would be fun but he might regret it ...

Anyway, to make a long story short, Butchie chased us all over the 
place and eventually killed all three of us (one warrior dropped due 
to lag). We then had a great time trying to grab our stuff, find the 
stairs to 3, and not get turned into hamburger at the same time :)

On 3 we stumbled across Leoric and I played rabbit while the mage 
blasted him with Holy Bolt. Leoric fell without any of us getting a 
scratch, leaving some rags which, to add insult to injury, got eaten 
by lag :p

In the midst of this I actually had to ask a PK buddy of mine who had 
joined the game looking for me to leave these guys alone. I mean, a 
full public game with only legits is just too precious a thing to cut 
short with a PK ... however much fun it usually is :)

Well after awhile I had to go (it is getting mighty late after all) 
so I referred them to Snakegod as I was leaving. I know that Snakegod 
and Inferno have their deep philosophical differences, but I think 
legit players are to be nurtured whenever encountered. Salmissra 
folds the legit co-oppers to her busom whilst I and my friends like 
BLZ, Morte and Elijah hunt the cheaters. Good division of labor, eh?
