&#62; Hello everyone!
&#62; 
&#62; I had to take a trip to reality for the past week or so, what can I 
&#62; say? It's good to be back!! I have to admit real life is getting more 
&#62; and more interesting, but I looked forward to comming back to talk to 
&#62; my fellow Inferno, Snakegods , Ordos, and Tarots. And even Eugene! :)
&#62; 
&#62; I understand that many things have changed during my absents from 
&#62; B.net, the following are questions that I have and would like to ask 
&#62; you to imform me about the subject.
&#62; 
&#62; 1)  Who is Fluffy Bunny???

ALL PRAISES BE TO FLUFFY_BUNNY!! He is a level .15 mage who has 
declared himself lord and ruler of b.net. He is my master. If you do 
not wish to incurr his wrath, and perish by his hand, I suggest you 
bow down in worship to him. So who is he? Well, let's just say I've 
seen him bossing some Llamas around...

&#62; 2)  What is this about Talon and The:Godly:Soul being banned?

Talon (maybe it was him, and maybe he was framed... hard to say...) 
posted a hideous post this weekend which... er... well... I'm not 
gonna repeat what it was, but I'm sure someone will tell you. Then 
TGS responded to it, making an equally perverse and unacceptable 
statement... then TheMan started a petition on the forum to ban them 
for it... then when Blizzard came into work on Monday morning, they 
were banned. There's a couple posts about it by a Blizzard tech 
support guy, which is probably on the second or third page by now. 
All the offending posts have been removed, so don't bother looking 
for them.

&#62; 3) Did TGS's promissed assult on the Snakegods took place?

Nope. After he sent me a copy of his plan, and I posted it here in 
Ogden's, he abandoned the plan, and later &#34;surrendered&#34; to 
Salmissra, and recently acknowledged me as his superior (sadly, that 
was one of the posts that was removed =(). He's still being his usual 
pain-in-the-neck self to us, though.

&#62; 4) How is newbie hunting goin my fellow Infernos??

Don't know much about that... but from the posts I've been seeing it 
sounds like it's going well.

&#62; 5) Is Inferno and Snakegod fighting? *again?*

No. Were we ever? Tracy managed to kill a couple of us... myself 
included... but I'll let her tell you the story, I'm sure she'll want 
to imbellish it some.

&#62; 6) What is all the fuss about Blizzard monitering B.net?

? I assume you mean the censoring they did mentioned above... they've 
always been doing it, it's just that it came to our attention a 
little bit more this week.

&#62; 
&#62; If you can answer these questions for me, I give you my gratitude. 
&#62; Thank you for your time.

No problem.

&#62; 
&#62; Um, one more thing.... Cuda, have you recieved a bounty on me YET?! :-
