<pre>     I have a 38th lvl rouge that has found both a king's bastard 
sword of blood (which I transferred to my warrior) and a godly great 
helm of the whale (the only usable godly item Wirt ever offered me, 
but very nice it is.) She also has an obsidian ring of the tiger with 
the max, +40&#37;, on resist all. I'm pretty sure my sorceror had an 
awesome shield of the tiger (or something real similar) before he 
found stormshield. He also has a royal circlet which is much better 
for him than ghow. However, for some reason my rouge has never found 
either of the good unique bows, or a strange bow which all the 
dueling rouges seem to have.
     I'm babbling about all this just to say I'm not sure how 
possessing any of those items you mentioned (except for the guy that 
has 2 obsidian zodiacs) means they cheated. Of course, this is where 
the game really got wrecked by cheating; if I accomplished the 
ultimate and actually found godly full plate of the whale or a king's 
long war bow of thunder (apparently they can be found, but are 
extremely rare) people would assume I got them from a hack or dupe. 
Personally, I'm skeptical of all those rouges with strange bows since 
I've never seen one in all my days of fighting and shopping. If I 
duel I am always suspicious of whether I'm fighting a fair fight or 
not. Perhaps, godmode I'd notice, but is this guy really using all 
legit items? For the stuff you mentioned though, I'd have to say that 
unless you have other reasons for thinking they cheat you probably 
shouldn't be alarmed about it.</pre>
