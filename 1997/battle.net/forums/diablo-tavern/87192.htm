<pre>The game get's more interesting.  The loot was valuable and the 
player wants it back!  He contacts a powerful bounty hunter who 
either solo or in a pack tracks down and MKill's the thief who MK'd 
the player.  He takes all of his stuff and holds it ransom until the 
thief gives up the stolen loot.  Then he finds out it was pawned at a 
black market storehouse character.  The hunt continues, but the loot 
is nowhere to be found.  The bounty hunter then offers the thief's 
goods to the victim... who prizes the possesion of the ear of the 
thief more than anything else.

Sure there will be some private games still... as friends want to 
play with friends.  Or people want to be left alone just like today.

But in the public game a higher level game would emerge that 
surrounds the individual 4-player games... one of trading, tracking 
and hunting, black markets, detectives, etc.  Sure it will sting 
harder to lose your equipment when it is impossible to instantly 
recall it, but that only thickens the plot.

I always play public games and my policy is &#34;If I didn't see a 
monster drop it, I don't pick it up&#34;.  I play public games even 
though there may be MKillers and PKillers and dupers all over the 
place because I enjoy the thrill of playing among strangers.  Being 
MKilled is rare for me because I play in a defensive way.  Being 
PKilled is not as rare, but I can often jump out of the labyrinth  
before they get my ear.  I would like to be able to trade equipment 
with others because my sorceror is always finding great warrior and 
rogue equipment but sells it to Griz.

Of all the cheats, I would consider duping to be the worst.  It 
totally destroyed the value of trading.</pre>
