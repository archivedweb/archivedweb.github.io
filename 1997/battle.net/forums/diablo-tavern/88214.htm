<pre>Well, i've done lots of dueling, so i guess these stories of 
ineptitude are rather generic but they happen quite a bit:

Some level 40 wizard was bragging in &#34;The Sorceror's Tower&#34; 
about how he was level 40 and how he had a level 15 fireball and 
teleport and could kick anyone's @ss.  At the time i guess level 40 
was pretty impressive seeing as there where so few of them, but i 
decided to speak up and take on his challenge.
We enter a game and go down to the dungeons, i tell him to clear them 
out, and we both do.  Ok i say, &#34;Ready?&#34; &#34;yeah&#34; ok, 
&#34;go&#34;.  All of a sudden i am hearing that rushing/poping noise 
of teleport (i was only level 27 and had not found a book of 
teleport).
This wizard runs ragged throughout the dungeons looking for me (i 
hadn't thought to put up a mana shield... it was only the dungeons.).
Anyways, all of a sudden a golden ball appears outside of this room i 
am in and pauses.  &#34;ok, where are you?  i am almost out of 
potions.&#34; says the mage, so i pop open the door and blast him 
something fierce, he dies.  He didn't even shoot back at me (or 
didn't have the time to).  I won the duel and never even put up a 
shield.

As for other odd duels... hmm, i once had a guy try to apoc me to 
death.  Another insisted that lightning does more damage then 
fireball (i forget how he came to that conclusion, something about 1-
80 damage per pixel.. ), you'd think the 3-0 butt kicking i dished 
out woulda changed his mind but oh no, he accuses me of cheating and 
leaves.

Then of course there are those newbie mages who insist upon 
teleporting all around you, stopping now and then to take pot shots.
I beat a guy who did this once and asked him how many potions he had 
used (the duel had gone on for an inordinate amount of time), he says 
24 and that his inventory was empty.  &#34;didn't i say belt only in 
chat?&#34;, &#34;yeah&#34; he says, &#34;but its obvious you got God 
mode on, all you did was stand there&#34;.  AAAnyways i thought to my 
self, no need to tell him i only used three potions.

Well, i suppose there are a couple dozen more duels that could go 
under the humourous pile, but that would require use of the brain to 
recall them.  Something at 2 am i am not willing to do.

later.
