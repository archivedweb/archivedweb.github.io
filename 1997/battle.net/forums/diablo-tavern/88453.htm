&#62; Isnt that always the way? Make Contact with an alien civilization and 
&#62; no one believes you. I know that feeling. Oh well, anything that 
&#62; Robert Zemeckis directs can come from one of two places: outer space 
&#62; and Alabama. Either way its pretty much the same I'd say. Jodie 
&#62; Foster acting as good as usual. On a scale of 1 to Z this movie gets 
&#62; a &#34;!&#34;, along with a &#34;!+&#34; for originality. I wish that 
&#62; there was more in the actual contact scene, but I guess writers didnt 
&#62; want to spoil the actual real life contact when it happens. 
&#62; 
&#62; OK ladies, gentlemen, and others, you're face to face with non-earth 
&#62; sentience, what do you say? You know what I'd say, &#34;OY!&#34; But 
&#62; I've always said that to most non-earth sentience, or was that earth 
&#62; non-sentience? 
&#62; 
&#62; If we ever build a something that connects us to other intelligent 
&#62; planets, the first thing we should send is a red herring. You dont 
&#62; think that they'd take that the wrong way do you? I know I'm always 
&#62; impressed by a nicely ripened red herring myself. Then we can send 
&#62; VCR's to prove how complex we are as a race of beings. Along with a 
&#62; &#34;how-to&#34; video that tells how to operate a VCR, this would 
&#62; prove how dumb we could be. Maybe even we could even get our most 
&#62; puzzling questions answered, like, does the light stay on when you 
&#62; close the door to the fridge? Or, how many licks does it take to get 
&#62; to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop? 
&#62; 
&#62; Anywho, I liked this movie, maybe the sequal could be Contact 2: The 
&#62; Line is Busy, Please Hang Up and Try Again. Or, Contact 2: The Bill. 
&#62; Should we use 1-800-COLLECT? I bet we'd get fined roaming charges 
&#62; though. oh well, such is the nature.
