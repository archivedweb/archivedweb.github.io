<pre>  &#60;snip a bunch of rambling&#62;

   Rolf,
 First I have asked you several times now to simply organize your 
replies in some sort of order. Try to atleast use some kind of 
paragraph structure to layout you arguments. Thanx.

  Now, down to buisness. You are right about pking in one regard, 
that is that you have the general ideas down. You go into a public 
game and 
work you way into the situation there. Do I gain trust and then 
betray it? YUP! Do I pretend to co-op? YUP! Do I then do my best to 
pk/mk them? YUP! Thats what a pk is. Plain and simple. I for one am 
not ashamed to call myself one. It has added many more months of 
enjoyment to this game for me. Even though it gets harder and harder 
to pk every day.
  Now in the good ol' days Pking was so much fun. Bounty hunters 
would hunt you down for a whooping 1000 gold! Yes bounties were that 
big!!! That was cash back then. It was fun to avoid or defeat those 
guys. That is pretty much dead now. Most bounty hunters are god mode 
gnarled root ring wearing unlimited mana using cheaters. 
  Pking was meant to be as much a part of this game as co-oping. In 
the pre-release days all the game magazines were all talking about 
how 
intersting to &#34;player attack&#34; option would be. It was not 
meant just for duels. It was put in the game so that people could be 
EVIL SOB's.
Evil vs Good is the heart of all roleplaying. Without one or the 
other there is no point. Now I know that the monsters are  
&#34;evil&#34; and that co-oping to defeat Diablo is one way to play 
the game. I have done, still do it, and will continue to do it. Yes 
that is right. Pk's co-op too. (Although the group I co-op with has a 
tendency to try to mk you at every turn.) 8) You know what!? That 
makes that kind of co-oping damn fun. I like to go treasure hunting 
with Eugene, Tracy, and Morte. Why? Because I know that they will try 
to clear all the levels faster than me. I know that when we hit level 
15 they are going to try to rush to Laz's Lounge and collect all the 
goodies....and I have to constantly watch my back..eheh...that is 
damn fun.
  
  Pking in general is not for everyone. It requires one hell of a lot 
of skill to it legit. You seem to think that it is easy to walk into 
a game and go down an kill someone. Well, even in the old days it was 
no cake walk. You never know what the other guy is capable of. Is 
that sword a Sabre of Vitality? or is a Kings Sword of Gore.? You 
won't find out until you attack. 
  Pkillin now is a damn chore. First you need to see if the targer 
has god mode or whatever. Even if he doesn't you still may end up 
facing
a KSOH with the added pluses of 2 gnarled root rings....thats almost 
+800 damg! One swipe and you are dead. But, it keeps things 
interesting. 8)
  
   Rowlf, you attack me at every turn when I post against cheating.
You make pointed personal attacks against me for posting, what I 
would call pretty well thought out essays of sorts, on cheating and 
its effects on the game. The above post was simply trying to show 
that online diablo is not nintendo. When you cheat it affect 
everyone. You once again just skipped the entire post and went to the 
very last thing I posted...about missing the old days. Well Rowlf! 
You were not even around then. Most people who still play were not 
around then. You don't know how much goddamned fun it was for the 
first month. Before duping and cheating came. DO I KNOW EVERYTHING 
ABOUT THIS GAME!? HELL NO. But I sure as hell know more than you do. 
You still probably think that Griswold will sell you back something 
you sell to him..
   Rowlf, you are nothing more that a ignorrant fool. DUPING IS 
CHEATING. CHEATING IS BAD. PKING DID NOT drive folks into private 
games, cheating did. Pk's were around since day one. Did everyone run 
and hide then!? NO. Did people hate pks? OH YES! If given a choice I 
think most legit co-opers would turn pk before cheating. CHEATING is 
the problem, not pking.
   SO, take you attacks and foolishness to someone who cares. You 
really are a weed. You pop up through the cracks in the ground every 
now and again, and you make an ugly statement. Then we rip your 
argument out by the roots, but you still pop back up, as ignorrant as 
ever but still full of self righteous BS. So, do us all a favor. Just 
give it up or at the very least...SHAAAADDDDUPPPPPP.
    AND YES! I do know quite a bit about gardening, and you have the 
familiar smell of something I would spread over tomato patch.

TO ALL : The original post was a simple groups of thoughts on why 
people don't think cheating in Diablo is bad. This fellow ignored all 
that and just likes to attack me...oh well.
