&#62; Hello.  If you read the forum posts #74924 and #74937, you will see 
&#62; some posts by Talon and The Godly Soul.  Talon used my name to post 
&#62; some disgusting, terrible, aweful post and it was sickening.  Then, 
&#62; later, The Godly Soul posted a post that &#34;ok'd&#34; raping women. 
&#62;  This HAS to stop.
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to make a petition to have Talon and The Godly Soul 
&#62; banned from the Diablo Forums, not for posting flames, but for 
&#62; posting sick, disgusting, harrassing posts to certain groups of 
&#62; American society.
&#62; 
&#62; The forum is read by people from 9 to 67 or so years of age.  Little 
&#62; kids read it to laugh and maybe post, as do many of us.  But today, 
&#62; that all changed.
&#62; 
&#62; Talon used my name, which I am not mad about, to post a sick, 
&#62; disgusting message.  This message was tasteless and was not a 
&#62; &#34;flame&#34; but a sick display of wanting attention.  NO ONE 
&#62; should have to read it, and it was in aweful taste and delivery.  
&#62; And, then he had the gall to later say that &#34;I&#34; did it.  God, 
&#62; we can't have that.
&#62; 
&#62; I am not mad at him for blaming me, but I believe non of us have to 
&#62; listen to that.  Calling someone &#34;gay&#34; is one 
&#62; thing...actually describing a person being raped in detail is in 
&#62; poor, poor taste.
&#62; 
&#62; And, then, The Godly Soul had the gall to post that &#34;raping women 
&#62; is okay&#34; and added some details.  That was uncalled for!!
&#62; 
&#62; For all the people on Battle.net who read that, and the little kids, 
&#62; I am sorry you had to read that, if you did.  But, I want to make 
&#62; those two pay.
&#62; 
&#62; I want like to have a petition to have them banned from the forum for 
&#62; their conduct.  I talked to several people on B.net.  One of them, a 
&#62; thirteen year old boy named &#34;EricTheRed&#34; was appalled and was 
&#62; angry at them.  FireBrand told me his ten year old sister read it.  
&#62; Other people from various parts of B.net called it trashy and a few 
&#62; of the female players were appalled, all for good reason.  The posts 
&#62; were an insult to B.net, us, players, guilds, and the general public.
&#62; 
&#62; You DON'T post about rape and such in a public forum, and The Godly 
&#62; Soul and Talon posted for it, Talon making a joke of it, The Godly 
&#62; Soul actually aproving it!  It is a shame some human dregs of society 
&#62; are allowed to have access to the forum and post those obscene 
&#62; messages.  Even Eugene, whom Talon called a lamer, would not post 
&#62; like THAT! (Eugene, if you even think you are under these lowlifes, 
&#62; don't think so.  Even though we are not on good terms, you are still 
&#62; MUCH better than them.)
&#62; 
&#62; So, I would like to start a petition (not like I need to, Talon and 
&#62; The Godly Soul may be banned anyhow, now that I think of it.)  But, 
&#62; this is a matter of principle.
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to state that The Godly Soul and Talon need to be banned 
&#62; from the forum for posting this sick, twisted, disgusting drivel in 
&#62; the presence of players of all ages, and they did it not as an attack 
&#62; on a guild, but as a way to really offend some people, and it was 
&#62; just terrible.  Then, The Godly Soul said rape of women was okay, and 
&#62; made several other comments.  Read posts #74924 and #74937 if you are 
&#62; old enough and have the stomach to view it. I would recommend not, 
&#62; they are trash and not worth your time.
&#62; 
&#62; But, I would like to state this....they need to be banned.  I ask all 
&#62; players and posters on B.net and the forum to sign this petition, 
&#62; which simply states The Godly Soul and Talon need to be banned for 
&#62; their conduct.  What they posted was wrong for everyone, and none of 
&#62; us deserve to hear it.  
&#62; 
&#62; So, please, waste one post and sign the petition and say you want 
&#62; them banned for posting such terrible and disgusting trash in the 
&#62; forum against other people and women.
&#62; 
&#62; We would all appreciate it.
&#62; 
&#62; Thank you, and God Bless if you sign this petition.
&#62; 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  Talon and The Godly Soul...I did not care who you guys posted 
&#62; as...but what you have done is a mockery to everyone in this place.  
&#62; I am not angry at you two...just disgusted members of the human race 
&#62; can act this way.
&#62; </pre>
