<blockquote>
<pre>           From 'Arthur Rex' by Thomas Berger        

          ...and Arthur took one of the burning torches from its 
      bracket upon the wall and hurling aside a great tapesrty of
      Arras he thereby discovered a little doorway giving onto a
      spiral staircase that connected the throne room with 
      the lower regions of the castle.  Thrusting his torch ahead he
      led the lady through the doorway into the cellars, where there
      was a great chill of dampness and the odor of mold, and beyond
      the reach of the light the noise of scurryings could be heard.
      &#34;We have reached the treasury. It is guarded by a 
dwarf,&#34; King
      Arthur said smiling. &#34;Come let us rouse him, for he is a 
droll
      little fellow.&#34;
      At length a voice of high pitch came in answer: &#34;Which rogue
      doth disturb me?&#34;
      King Arthur cried, &#34;The King!&#34;
      There came the sound of bolts being withdrawn and at length the
      door opened so that a small face could be seen, and it was the
      height from the floor of a normal man at kneel.
      &#34;With a wench,&#34; said the dwarf disagreeably, and the 
lady did
      gasp at his impudence.  &#34;Come in or go away, the draught is
      chilling my tea.&#34;
      &#34;Whilst thou eateth thy tea,&#34; said Arthur, &#34;we 
shall just peek
      at my treasure.&#34;
      The dwarf clasped an iron ring on the floor, the which he
      raised, bringing a trap-door along with it. &#34;There's the 
      bleeding lode then,&#34; he huffed.
      The lady looked into the opening and saw gold and gems in a
      great heap the summit of which was so close that she could have
      knelt and with two hands gathered sufficient of it to buy a 
      kingdom.
      The dwarf found a pail with a rope attached, the which he
      carried to the hole and lowered thereinto. Fetching it up it
      brimmed over with golden coins and glittering jewels, some of 
      which fell out and clattered on the floor. A fat emerald bounced
      near the lady, who unobtrusively covered it with the instep of
      her slipper.
      Now King Arthur said to the lady, &#34;Choose a bauble for 
thyself.
      Take a winking sapphire or crystalline diamond, a carbuncle red
      as blood...&#34;
      &#34;Or the greenie she has got her hoof on,&#34; said the 
dwarf.
      She said uncovering the emerald, &#34;Ah, I did never know 'twas
      there.&#34;
      And she colored, not in shame but rather from hatred for the
      dwarf, whom she determined to have put to death when the castle
      was hers.
      &#34;A pretty thing it is,&#34; she said holding it so the 
light did
      flash verdantly through it. Then all at once she pitched the
      emerald into the vault.
      &#34;If a woman don't take one jewel,&#34; said the dwarf, 
&#34;then it's 
      that she doth want two.&#34;
          
          
          Later that night, as the castle slept, an armed party in the
      service of the lady gained entrance through a door giving onto
      the moat.  Being greedy men they looked immediately for the 
      treasury, with the idea of sacking it first and going afterwards
      to kill the sleeping population.
      Thus they sought and found the door behind which the dwarf slept
      over the treasure vault, and they knocked him up.  And when with
      even more bad humor than usual he opened the door and peeped
      out, these men, all great stout fellows, burst within, the
      foremost seizing the dwarf by the neck with the purpose to wring
      it like a goose.
      But the little neck swelled and burst from the grasp, becoming a
      serpentine throat covered with golden scales, surmounted by a
      great dragon's head with red eyes and enormous fangs and a snout
      from which came two bursts of flame which burned the brigand 
      into a cinder, and then the tail swung around collecting the
      entire party and they where likewise consumed by the flame.
      When this was done the fearsome beast transformed himself into a
      dwarf once again, who swept up the ashes with a little broom and
      dustpan and deposited them in the fireplace.

      For these rogues had forgotten that by tradition a dragon guards
      all royal lodes...
