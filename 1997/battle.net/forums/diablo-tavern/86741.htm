                     &#34;Ahhh...'The Old 
Days'.....&#34;.........when a PKr could backstab to h/is/er heart's 
content without having to ID themself for some wierdo's idea of a 
'fair' duel; when &#34;cheating&#34; had REAL meaning instead of some 
trivial addititonal idea of lying about what your intentions are in a 
game with another; when a PKr could backstab a 'co-player' (and maybe 
with a helper or two) and didn't have to worry about whether or not 
the stolen...pardon...'won'... items were cheaply gotten 
dupes/trades/hacks/whatever; when a backstabber who considers 
themself 'honorable' 'cause they don't 'dupe' could hold their head 
high over their accomplishments...ignoring their hypocitical and 
undeservedly extremely rude arrogance and contempt to anyone who 
disgreed with them in action...or even words; when one didn't HAVE to 
go into Private games to backstab but coulld go into ANY  Public game 
and have one's pick of Any relative newbie who, definitionally coming 
into the game after those who were here first, just didn't Really 
know 'the score'...yet; when a backstabber didn't HAVE to worry about 
others having 'god'-(and-knows-what-else) mode; when one didn't HAVE 
to think about whether any 'won', ergo 'possibly-duped/hacked' items 
one sold to Griswold, via the 'practically-duped '  extra money,  
gives one a 'dis-honorable'/unfair advantage over others...ergo 
making one a 'cheater'.........ah, yes, 'the good old days'...when 
one didn't HAVE to actually THINK about what 
'honor'/'cheating'/'legitimacy' REALLY means; when one could 
Scapegoat those who take 'the Easy Way' (even though one helped chase 
them to that direction...but, that's  to be ignored)  as the 'ruin of 
B-Net'...though all they ruined was Purists Demands that they play 
with the Purists  ONLY on the Purists  terms (which allowed some 
Purists to ruin the 'Easy-way'rs game, but not vice-versa).------
&#60;- Had the Purists and 'Easy-Way'rs AVOIDED each other....how 
could who 'ruin' whose game?&#62;-------- Ah, yes...'The Old 
Days'...when you could play m-p Diablo 'the way it was intended to be 
played': NOT 'co-operating' with each other to 'get Mr. D'...but to 
push the new PK abilitiy TO THE HILT and Pretend, Decieve, 
Lie...honorably, of course... that you're 'co-op'ing while you wait 
until your 'partner''s back's turned, and then...PK'em; THAT'S the 
way it 'was intended to be played', right?....Ah, 'The Good Old 
Days'...when Newbies paid obsequieous (get the dictionary 'big-word' 
disliker) attention to insults, name-calling and any kind of personal 
attacks to disagreers...they're not really gone, but they ARE  on 
their way out.ya know, Bob, I REALLY intended to not respond to 
anything you said after our last...discussion... on 'cheating';  but 
this....Nostalgiia...for 5-card-stud that's SO filled with resentment 
that some wish to play Draw-with-dueces-wild...and are capable of 
defending themselves from PK (your?) attacks [I'll bet you're an 
'anti-gun'r, right?]....well, you inadvertently pushed my button. 
I'll try to exert more self-control in the future. Really, though, 
you're whole piece absolutely smacks of condescending arrogance of a 
know-it-all (your stated disclaimers notwithstanding) who absolutely 
RESENTS disagreement.         Have a nice day.         ---------------

grapevine&#34;____know anything about gardening, Bob?
