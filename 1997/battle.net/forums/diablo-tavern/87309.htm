&#62; actors when they do not have any script to act from? 
&#62; The body count in the pilot is about 100. The entertainment value of 
&#62; this is same as the mass newbie killing - 0. Do not expect any gross 
&#62; violence: they use maybe one bottle of ketchup in the whole episode. 
&#62; The movie is full of bloated public speeches that TheMan would be 
&#62; proud of, and the only likeable character is that black-haired evil 
&#62; woman (Tracy, is that what you look like?). 
&#62; So my point is: you can't get anything for your millions anymore. All 
&#62; that FOX got was some bad script, 4 bad actors, 100 extras, one 
&#62; bottle of ketchup and a few shacks.
&#62; Don't let this series interrupt your Monday routine.

	I heard from a few people a while back on the Tavern that this show 
was a rip off of Braveheart. No kidding. I agree. The acting leaves a 
lot to be desired. The writting is incredibly predictable. The make 
up is pathetic. In the era this show takes palce in people did not 
walk around with clean fluffy hair. The props were not too bad but 
they could have been alot better. Call me blood thirsty but this show 
needs much more gore. A bottle of ketchup? More like a tiny packet! I 
would love to know where the 3 million went to because it certainly 
does not show up in the show. Throughout the entire episode I 
couldn't help but be reminded of Herculese and Xena (yes, I watch 
those shows from time to time and beleive me they are a hell of alot 
more entertaining.) I am willing to watch the next four episodes (too 
generous I know). Maybe (and this is a HUGE maybe), the show might 
improve enough to be just barable. I know I sound a tad harsh but I 
had high hopes for this show and I was given an extreme let down.
