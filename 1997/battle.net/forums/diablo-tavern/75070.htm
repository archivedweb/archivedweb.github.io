[munch post asking for ban co-petitioners]

While I agree that some posts here are tasteless, offensive and 
should be removed asap you miss the point...

Blizzard does not have the technology nor manpower to fulfill the 
request you are petitioning for.

To have a &#34;gated community&#34; one must first pay for a fence, a 
gate, and a fulltime security guard. Blizzard did not believe that 
building such would be profitable so they didn't.

Perhaps you should first petition them with $ pledges to help 
convince them they were wrong? In the meantime, however well 
intentioned you request may be, it's just a waste of time.

As you should be able to tell from the recurrent ghosts clogging bnet 
on weekends, Blizzard doesn't even have an effective fulltime 
operator monitoring battlenet. Surely you see that the forums are 
even lower on their priority list? Many online services/games have a 
model whereby well-behaved concerned citizens such as yourself [hmm, 
am I completely oblivous to the fact that you are a member of a PK 
guild or am I being ever so slightly facetious?] can volunteer your 
time to help support and/or police the community. Diablo/battlenet 
isn't among them. Your petition may cause them to rethink things more 
than they already have prior to the Starcraft launch, so perhaps it's 
not all for nought.


I should be delighted to have Blizzard post that I'm wrong, that help 
is on the way.  Then again, I've been waiting for an acknowledged bug 
list and release date for v1.04 for many many weeks too. I'll believe 
it when I see it.

In the meantime, to brighten an otherwise sour post, I'd like to say 
how much I appreciate those who are *still* hanging out on the forum 
and bnet psuedo-public rooms trying to stem the tide. Online 
communities are here to stay, and you will eventually triumph 
(remember that the wild wild west [hmm, that spells www, doesn't it?] 
was once a pretty rough place but now everyone peacefully stays at 
home and watches TV or surfs the internet ;-)

Life goes on,
Crystalion</pre>
