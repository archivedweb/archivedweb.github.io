&#62; What PatN. wrote...
&#62; &#62; The Reason battle.net has been having problems today is this:  We
&#62;  &#62; have been the target of malicious attacks by those trying to 
&#62; bring 
&#62; &#62; the servers down.  We are currently gathering information regarding 
&#62; &#62; these attacks and expect to have the servers up and running later 
&#62; &#62; this evening.
&#62; &#62;
&#62; &#62; We appreciate your patience in this matter, and apologize for the 
&#62; &#62; downtime.
&#62; &#62;
&#62; &#62; Regards,
&#62; &#62; Pat N.
&#62; 
&#62; And you know who the losers behind these attacks probably are? Think 
&#62; about it... what guild wants to destroy bnet? Isn't it obvious? It 
&#62; must be that guild we all know as (P)Lague...
&#62; Their motto is: 
&#62; &#34;Diablo was a failure. So let's destroy battle.net.&#34;
&#62; At least that's how I remember that lamer sayin' it...
&#62; Now you get the idea?
&#62; 
&#62;                   -$9.95 Supreme Overlord PK
&#62;                    Bows to Fluffy_Bunny
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;The major evil is within us, invisible to thy eyes, but always 
&#62; there. It consumes, it grows...&#34;

You are right $9.99,

(P)Lague could be the cause or the other cheating guilds too. Diablo 
is a great game, I love this game. I hate to see Battle.net go down 
because of a few LITTLE cheaters. I can't wait til the patch is out 
and then all NON-CHEATERS will take over Battle.net again. I miss the 
old days, PKers that doesn't cheat kills Legit players, Then The 
Bounty-Hunters Legit Kills the legit PKers and so on and so on. Take 
care Friend. My ICQ nickname is Darkwing.

Darkwing (AAF)

&#34;See a cheater, kill a cheaters, see a monster, lure a monster to 
the body, res the cheater, and let the moster kill a cheater.&#34; My 
tactics to hunt down a cheater for the victium.</pre>
