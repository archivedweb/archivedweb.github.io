<pre>Yup. here it is. This post deals with several issues: Proving that 
TheMan is powerthirsty bastard, Proving that he is a coward, proving 
that he is a cheater and finally proving that he is a traitor.. but 
let us begin:
Why is TheMan powerthirsty bastard? Simple, because first thing he 
did when came back in Inferno is made himself and his lapdog Haplo 
TO's, I doubt there was ANY election of any kind whatsoever, anyway 
they both now TO and they made flux something like a bar maid and 
pretty much ready to kick her out... something REAL TO in OLD Inferno 
would NEVER do... All Theman ever wanted was an imaginatory power.... 
now he thinks he has it... I would love to hear from as many Inferno 
as possible HOW many of you really think TheMan and Haplo should lead 
Inferno... btw.. flux? I warned you what a piece of crap TheMan is..

TheMan is sure a coward... today he spent in chat nearly several 
hours chatting with his asskidders Tracy who wanted to duel (TheMan 
obviously had time) Was banned on sight.. I guess he doesn't like to 
be challenged....

Yes TheMan is a cheater! Player who has level 50 warrior and many 
level 40+ characters should of already know that Shields of harmony 
do not exist and that rings WERE NEVER POSSIBLE TO BUY in Multyplayer 
game... Yup.. today TheMan said that before you could buy a ring in 
multyplayer..... he he eh.. I was on B.net since day 1.... well.. 
things could be wrong when 0.00 version of Diablo was on.... 

Yes TheMan is a traitor.. flux got him back into Inferno and first 
thing TheMan does is kicking flux out... Flux? Didn't I tell you what 
a piece of crap he was? Didn't I tell you that ALL he wanted is to 
sit in chat and order his little doggies around? Yes.. all TheMan and 
Haplo can do is sit in chat and Ban... they both ARE complete 
losers...trust me on that one....</pre>
