<pre>I finally got my life into slightly more order than the previous chaos
and hooked my computer up to the internet. I watched X-files (file 8)
with a friend and then hopped on top the b.net for a game. First game
was a bit of a washout and I was dropped from the net. Second game
I meet a rouge calling herself Shayde. Shayde, thanks a lot for the 
game. You were a great start to a nights play. (What happened by the
way ? One minute I'm in the game, next I'm out in the chat area and
I wasn't disconnected. kicked?) Next I play through a few levels with 
someone else and have some fun until he has to go too. Then THE 
BASTARDLY DEED. I pick a game at random and join. The creator
was a level 5 dude so I think &#34;I'm on level 5, should be 
legit&#34; when i
get a message: &#34;come down my portal&#34; from some 14th level 
bast. I
switch weapons to spare sword and shield and go down. Two seconds
later I'm kissing dirt, When all of a sudden a new player zips down 
and
procedes to kick pk butt. I was lured by these 2 with promises of 
legit
play and they wiped the floor with me. the new player (Maydene, I 
think) was a pk hunter thank god. We played a few levels when 
HELLRAISER pops on and starts whining for a portal. I ask if he's 
legit and the reply is &#34;what's that mean?&#34; and 
&#34;legit?&#34; so I think 1st
time player who hasn't been to ogden's tavern and hasn't learnt the
lingo so I use my only town portal scroll (Thanks Shayde) to fetch 
this
guy in hopes of a fun game. I get up there and this severl hacked,
overarmoured, rude git looks at me and says &#34;where's your armour? 
I'm going to kick the shit out U.&#34; so i say &#34;why?&#34; to 
which he replies
&#34;Because you don't cheat.&#34; so i whisper to my pk hunting 
friend what
is going on. I run down to level 5 to find my friend when BAM dead PK.
All the upper levels were cleared though so we ended up quiting.
All I can say about tonight (its 3 am here now) is :
                   PKers -&#62; you suck esp. when u cheat.
                   Legit co-op -&#62; keep the b.net alive
                   Shayde -&#62; women do make the best companions i 
suppose.

Thanks to the legits & co-ops I played with. Hellraiser and co. Why 
don't
you p!$$ off?
