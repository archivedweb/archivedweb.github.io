&#62; I am not going to apologize to quitters.
&#62; PoC, I am growing tired.
&#62; Tracy, we can duel, arrange a time sometime Friday, I am busy the 
&#62; rest of the week.  That is, if you don't chicken out. :)  I mean, 
&#62; you are PoC...how good can you be?
&#62; 

As far as I know, it is not TL who is the chicken.  You seem to be 
the one always avoiding everything.  Maybe Friday we can finally see 
what you're all about.

Just in case you're wondering who the hell I am (and you don't have 
to post that you don't care, trust me, I already know that):  There 
are only a few people that I have played with that will know of me.  
I have no affiliation with INFERNO, PoC, or any other Diablo/UO 
guild.  I only played Diablo for a little while and I haven't even 
played in a few months, but I've been keeping up with Ogden's on a 
fairly regular basis.  And it seems to me that you're causing more 
trouble than you're worth.  (Because it seems to me you're not worth 
jack s**t.)  Maybe if everyone would just ignore you you would go 
away...

&#62; And, to PoC....
&#62; NO offense, but I am angry at quitters who quit and then expect the 
&#62; guild they left to be friendly.
&#62; 
Let's say you leave a job to take a better job somewhere else, I 
guess you would expect all your former co-workers to hate you?  What 
kind of logic is this?  (Of course, you probably would have had no 
friends to begin with, so why would anyone even care?)

&#62; And, I am requesting to INFERNO to have you guys banned from the 
&#62; channel.  Because of one person.
&#62; 
Damn, I really hope they don't listen to your bulls**t in there.  Of 
course, it's mostly newbies now, so they may actually think you are 
someone!!  Wouldn't that be a laugh!!!

&#62; Pyro forced Fusion to quit.  And Pyro?  I may duel you..when you get 
&#62; good, and when you can talk without sounding like white trash in 
&#62; every word you say.  
&#62; 
&#62; So, I say this for PoC...
&#62; You guys can act all tough and big, but I still see right through 
&#62; you. You are all 13-17 year old kids trying to be big.
&#62; 
Actually, not everyone that plays is 13-17, I know this for a fact, 
as I know one of them personally.  Maybe you are, but not everyone 
is.  Sorry to spoil your little beliefs.  I guess you're not as 
psychic as you think &#34;I still see right through you...&#34; What 
a bunch of bulls**t.

&#62; So, PoC, you guys can stay out of INFERNO's way, period.  
&#62; 
&#60;heavy sarcasm&#62;Listen up, PoC!  The high master has 
spoken!!!&#60;/heavy sarcasm&#62;

&#62; But, TO make decisions in INFERNO, so they are the ones to decide.
&#62; 
And luckily that's not you!!

&#62; 
&#62; And to the PoC who call me a pussy, I may have cared, but you guys 
&#62; are just chopped liver also rans.  Shlonglor's Barbarians could beat 
&#62; you guys.
&#62; 
What the hell is &#34;chopped liver also rans&#34;??  Sorry, I don't 
speak idiot.

&#62; And Tracy?  Duel me on Friday. No ref.  If there is a ref, then just 
&#62; forget about it.  That way, we can settle it between us.
&#62; 
Scared to show your true self to more than one at a time?  Why is 
that?  So that if you lose, you can tell everyone that you won and 
say that Tracy's cheating?  Sounds like you've got your plans down, 
huh?  As long as you're only with one person at a time, you can 
accuse everyone of being a cheater!
&#60;heavy sarcasm&#62;You're so smart!&#60;/heavy sarcasm&#62;

&#62; And to Elijah and the other ilk, you guys can TRY and get me in UO. 
&#62; I just hope for your sakes I don't have some &#34;advantage,&#34; 
&#62; like stones. :)
&#62; Because this is not a threat to PoC.  Nor a Warning.
&#62; This is a promise.
&#62; You stay away from INFERNO, and get lost.  And if you do not....
&#62; Then I may need to stop being as kind to you as I have been.
&#62; 
&#34;This is a promise.&#34;  I'm sure they are scared.
And if this is being kind, I'd love to see you at your worst.

&#62; And SnowRabbit?  When you officially stop being a coward and come 
&#62; back, we can talk.
&#62; And now, I am off to gain the last two million experience and become 
&#62; level 50.
&#62; 
Well, have fun!  Like another level will help you win duels when all 
you ever do is chat!!

&#62; See you gentlemen later...and you too, PoC members.
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
Hopefully they'll learn and kick you out for good.

&#62; P.S.  Flux?  Say one word about this....I dare you.
Go ahead, Flux...I'd love to hear the response!!

Now that I've put in my $.02, I'll be going...
