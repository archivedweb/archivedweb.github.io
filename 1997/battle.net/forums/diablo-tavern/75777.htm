<pre>*Sigh*,

    It seems that no matter how bad someone offends you, Blizzard, 
there's no way you can truly keep them out.  If you ban their server 
(K-line or G-line them) from posting on the Tavern, they could just 
fire up an IP Spoofer and ~~~Poof!~~~ they're someone else.
    If it's inside of B.net (haven't been on in awhile... don't know 
how it's doing), you can't stop them either.  There are three 
different (and working!?!!) programs that change the account #.  You 
know you can't stop them if they really want to stay on, no matter 
how many patches you put on.  Good luck, but I doubt you'll ever 
truly 
keep unwanted people out.
    As I said before, I haven't been on in awhile, but I'm sure there 
are still cheats all over.  As long as someone can comb over Diablo 
and your patches with a Hex editor or more advanced program such as 
Softice, people will cheat Diablo.  It's kind of depressing if you 
think about it... Blizzard (you) and Blizzard North (uh... 
subdivision of you) create a great game, and the first thing people 
look to do is find a way to cheat.  Oh well, you can't stop human 
nature either.
