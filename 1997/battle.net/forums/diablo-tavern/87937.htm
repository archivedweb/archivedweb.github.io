Part IV

	&#34;Halt! Advance no further or you shall feel my wrath!&#34;, 
commanded the sorcerer. Stonehaven's eyes burned with a crimson 
flame. &#34;Who is this pathetic old man to be telling me what to 
do?&#34;, Stonehaven thought to himself. Stonehaven ignored the 
sorcerer's warnings and released a volley of electrical blue bolts 
towards the old one. The sorcerer stood his ground and did not even 
so much as flinch when the lightning struck him. Stonehaven stared in 
astonishment at his enemy and then his hands from which the lightning 
was emitted. Without a word the sorcerer swung his oaken staff in a 
wide arc before him and sent the glowing form of a small violet 
dragon at Stonehaven who was unprepared. The incantation struck 
Stonehaven with such a cruel unforgiving force that he was knocked 
many meters through the air and then against a massive spruce tree. 
Stonehaven's semi conscious body slid down the impenatrable trunk and 
came to rest on the mossy ground. Blood slowly oozed from his 
nostrils and the corners of his mouth. He felt as though the inside 
of his head had been set a blaze. The green-robed sorcerer walked 
over to his stunned opponent and with a smile reached out his hand 
and said, &#34;did you really think you could banish me to some far 
off realm and never have to face me again? I know of the fire that 
burns within your soul and if you wish I can aid you in it's 
tempering.&#34; &#34;...if.....I...refuse?&#34;, asked Stonehaven who 
could barely speak. His eyes could bearely stand the bright summer 
sun shining down upon him. &#34;Death is your only alternate 
option.&#34;, the sorcerer stated grimly. Stonehaven nodded and took 
the sorcerer's hand in an effort to make it back to his feet but as 
he took hold of the hand his vision became twisted and distorted. 

	As his eyes regained their keen focus Stonehaven found himself 
standing on a rocky platform just large enough to hold him only. The 
platform was floating in mid air. The throbbing pain inside his mind 
was now gone as was the sorcerer also. As he slowly became aware of 
his new hellish surroundings he sheilded his face from the scalding 
heat. Stonehaven was in what appeared to be a boundless cavern. 
Molten rock flowed freely beneath the platform. Brimstone and sparks 
fell from high above like tiny shooting stars but never struck him 
although he could feel their heat as they passed him by. Even the 
winds in this unholy place were of an incredible degree. Stonehaven 
found it almost completely impossible to breath. He could feel his 
legs weaken and shake from the extreme temperatures but he did not 
buckle. &#34;Aaaahhh! At long last my brother has returned 
home!&#34;, growled a echoing maliscious voice. Stonehaven lowered 
his arm just enough to look upon the imposing form of some blazing 
creature that was now filling the entire cavern in front of 
Stonehaven. &#34;Half brother!&#34;, roared Stonehaven, &#34;and I am 
gravely ashamed to call myself even that!&#34; The creature laughed 
so hard that the walls shook causing rocky chunks to plumet to their 
demise in the burning river below. &#34;Stonehaven, I am hurt&#34;, 
mocked the creature, &#34;what would mother and father say?&#34; The 
creature laughed again with similiar results. &#34;You have no 
parents! You were created out of unholy darkness. You were bred by 
greed, lust, hatred, and envy!&#34;, was Stonehaven's abrupt reply. 
The creature ceased it's jubilent activities and glared down at his 
younger brother. &#34;Why are you here?&#34;, it asked in a deadly 
curious voice, &#34;Is it because of that pathetic human who took her 
own life?&#34; Stonehaven could feel a terrible rage brewing in his 
soul at the creature's mocking of the woman he was forced to watch as 
she ended her life. &#34;Wonderfully horrilbe, don't you agree?&#34;, 
asked the creature who chuckled to himself, &#34;she turned her back 
on her own guild, her own guildmistress, and even her friends and 
then put herself out of her own misery with a simple blade.&#34;, the 
creature let loose with another roar, even more powerful than the 
last, which knocked Stonehaven to his knees. Stonehaven strained to 
return to his feet but he was too overcome with the searing 
temperature. &#34;Leave this place!&#34;, roared once again the 
flaming beast, &#34;let the humans deal with their own petty 
problems!&#34; The creature stopped as he pondered a wicked thought. 
&#34;Or&#34;, the creature continued, &#34;you could join with me! We 
would rule this world as we were meant to. As brothers!&#34; As soon 
as the creature's proposal reached Stonehaven's ringing ears he could 
feel the darkness within him that he had kept restrained all these 
years begin to stir and weaken his defences. His eyes began to 
flicker between a glowing hue of blue and a terrilbe blood red. 
&#34;No&#34;, hissed Stonehaven. His building rage finally reached 
it's boiling point and once again he confined his dark soul. He then 
sprange to his feet, ignoring the heat and pain, and glared at his 
brother. &#34;Never!&#34;, screamed Stonehaven, &#34;you have no 
power over me! You forget that draconians are not as susceptable to 
your mind tricks as humans tend to be. Stay alert, demon! As long as 
air still fills my lungs and blood rushes through my veins I will 
continue to hunt you!&#34; &#34;So be it!&#34;, said the demon as he 
swung a massive fist at Stonehaven. The blow knocked Stonehaven clear 
off his platform and he plummeted into the angry river below.

	&#34;Hey! Dark one! Wake up&#34;, said a voice from above. 
Stonehaven's eyes poped open and he jumped to his feet half expecting 
see his brother standing before him. Stonehaven looked around him and 
his heart slowly returned to it's normal rythym. He was in the 
village next to a stone well. Standing beside him was Tech-Deamon who 
had a worried look on her face. &#34;For a moment I thought you might 
have died on us there&#34;, she said with a slight smile. Stonehaven 
smiled back but only lightly. He was still disturbed by his recent 
dreams. &#34;Wouldn't that have been a shame&#34;, growled Cohen as 
he walked by; a fellow warrior slung over his shoulder. Snakegod and 
Ordo Rosea Moriatur were now just returning from their rescue 
mission. Not one member was uninjured. Some posessed only minor 
scratches while others grasped at bloody stumps that used to support 
various limbs. Stephen was helping a sorcerer who had lost an eye to 
an arrow. Salmissra limped by carrying the body of a fallen rogue. 
She gave Stonehaven a hostile look. He then noticed that it was not 
just Salmissra who held his gaze with contempt. Almost all of the 
brave souls who had ventured deep down into the earth to rescue their 
friend would have loved nothing more than to run a blade through 
Stonehaven. 

	&#34;Did you find your friend?&#34;, asked Stonehaven who felt a 
terrible guilt at his actions. Tech-Deamon's smile was replaced by a 
forlorn expression as she hung her head in sorrow. &#34;Yes&#34;, she 
replied quietly. Stonehaven did not have to ask any more. He knew of 
what fate Morteleux had fallen prey to. Just then Wiseman, Whisper, 
and two members of Snakegod lumbered past carrying a stretcher. On 
the stretcher were the mutilated remains of the sorcerer Morteleux. 
&#34;He was torn apart&#34;, said Tech-Deamon, &#34;there was nothing 
anyone could have done. Not even magic could save him.&#34; She 
stared blankly at the broken crowd of people. 

	Stonehaven walked over to the stretcher and had it's carriers stop 
and let it rest on the dry dusty earth. Stephen let a mage tend to 
his sorcerer friend and joined Stonehaven by Morteleux's almost 
unrecognizable body. &#34;Therre's Noothin yoou caan doo foor hem. 
Let hem be.&#34; Stephen placed a hand on Stonehaven's shoulder and 
then got up and walked away. Stonehaven looked down again at the 
remains. He placed his hands on what was left of the chest area. 
&#34;Move back!&#34;, yelled Stonehaven. Everyone gave eachother 
quick glances of curiousity. The earth began to tremble and then a 
deep rumble shook the village. Morteleux's remains slowly began to 
emit an amber glow and soon that glow surrounded Stonehaven as well. 
The glare became unbearable and the two guilds rushed to find some 
sheild from the incredible energy. The whole village was shaking 
violently. Slowly Morteluex's remains began to heal. His severed 
limbs re-attached to his body, split bone became whole, and muscle 
and flesh quickly spread over his restored frame. The light quickly 
vanished and Stonehaven returned to his feet; his hands shaking 
terribly. Morteleux's eyes slowly opened as he carefully stood up. 
The members of Snakegod and Ordo Rosea Moriatur abandoned their 
shelters and cautiously approached Morteluex who was smiling and 
looking and feeling quite splendid considering he had been dead for 
many days. He looked around at his friends and the dark one standing 
next to him who appeared to be dazed. &#34;Morteleux!!&#34;, yelled 
Cohen as he rushed up and gave his friend an enormous bear hug which 
lifted him off the ground. &#34;Cohen&#34;, said Morteluex with a 
still fatigued voice, &#34;if you do not put me down my insides are 
going to be all over your armour.&#34; Cohen laughed and returned his 
friend to the ground. 

	Everyone then turned to Stonehaven including Morteleux, who still 
had no idea of what had happened. Stonehaven turned to the crowd. 
&#34;If you all will excuse me, I think I will lay down for a 
while&#34;, said Stonehaven weakly. He then collapsed to the ground.
