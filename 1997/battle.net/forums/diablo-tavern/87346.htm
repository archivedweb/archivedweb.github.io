I am a level 42 mage, and my friend who is a level 41 tested nova a 
while ago when we bought a AA of NOVA. All my spells are maxed 
nornmally, don't know if that meansd anything, but with full 
lightning res my friend standing next to me took 18 dmage per hit. so 
mult times 4 and get 76 damge per nova bolt. Against a room full of 
people thsi is an efficient way to deliver damge but against a single 
target. Rediculous.  Even when we tested with mana shield down the 
effects weren't that much better. Nova could not have killed an 
experienced dueler if fireballs didn't thats a fact.



&#62; You are wrong Pyro, it's ot nova, nova is fairly weak spell. In fact 
&#62; I was using aa of nova with my mage Sarcomastigof. and Once I was 
&#62; dumb enough to try it against warrior... Buy Nova staff for yourself 
&#62; and see.. it's NOT nova.. it's autokill... YES my friend flux 
&#62; demonstrated me this trick, she says that she casts nova and then she 
&#62; casts nova and autokill(I don't accuse flux of cheating, she was 
&#62; trying to figure if my warrior was legit) anyway, since no one has 
&#62; slightest idea what Damage Nova does, it's impossible to complain! 
&#62; next time I buy AA of nova I will demonstrate it to you... believe 
&#62; me.. nova sucks.. especially in duel! Or I would already use it ... 
&#62; :) By the way... I joined many games with Godmoded jerks and let me 
&#62; assure you Nova does NOT cause lag! Autokill does....
&#62; P.S. haplo was a member of KoR and was kicked out of Inferno (OLD) 
&#62; for cheating... what U expect?</pre>
