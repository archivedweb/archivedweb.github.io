<pre>Hiya People,
        I just went to the Lohlander site, and went to the radio 
station.  There were some great songs there, and this one was forming 
itself in my head. Hope you like reading it as much as I liked 
writing it.

Diablo's been good to me so far.
Parody of : Life's been good to me.
Apologies go out to Joe Walsh, for this cut up version of his song.



I got a stormshield… forget the price.
I never use it, they tell me it's nice.
I play diablo, kill all the cheaters,
I have a psycologist, she tells me I'm fine.

They say I'm Crazy but I have a good time.
I'm just looking for clues like a G-P-O-W.
Diablo's been good to me so far.

My kings sword of slaying does over 85.
 I lost it to lag, now I don't fight.
I play a sorcerer, fight in the back.
 I use a mana shield in case I'm attacked.

I'm writing stories, my fans they can't wait.
They write me e-mail, tell me I'm great.
So I got me ICQ #1258909.
Just send a message, maybe I'll reply.

Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through.
Killed by gods more than a time or two.
I can't complain but sometimes I still do.
Diablo's been good to me so far.

I go to chat rooms sometimes until 7.
It's hard to leave when you can't find alt-F4.
It's hard to handle this reputation of evil.
Everybody's so different I haven't changed.

They say I'm lazy, but Diablo takes all my time.
I keep on playing and I think I know why.
Diablo's been good to me so far.
