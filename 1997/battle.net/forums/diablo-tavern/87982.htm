&#62; &#62; like, &#34;255/0&#34; or &#34;Indestructible(The most 
&#62; &#62; common)&#34;.... How do you get a legit and how much does it cost? I 
&#62; &#62; would like to know....

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Easy, they are BSing.  No one has legit GPOW.  Even a Holy Plate of 
&#62; Whale.  I doubt even Holy Plate exists anymore.  BLZ found some from 
&#62; version 1.0, but things were different back then.  Ok, recently I 
&#62; bought Holy Armor of Whale from Wirt.  It was base armor 12, 
&#62; +164&#37;, and +100 hit points.  Not bad.  It would have been 
&#62; worthwhile if it was Splint Mail.  However, it just Leather.  Price: 
&#62; 64K.  Now, that makes me believe that Splint mail like that does 
&#62; exist, Breastplate, too.  I doubt any other kinds.  Seeing how there 
&#62; are so many combos, I doubt that if it even existed odds are one in 
&#62; billion Wirt would sell it, and if you would even have the gold to 
&#62; buy it.  What some believe is that this stuff came from Single 
&#62; Player.  A lot of hacks/dupes come from there, like butcher cleaver 
&#62; stuff.  If this stuff DID come from single player, I wish Blizzard 
&#62; could make it in the next patch to null that stuff out.  Otherwise, 
&#62; imagine how the game would be if there was no single player to pull 
&#62; that stuff out of...
&#62; 
&#62; Later.
&#62; 
&#62; TL
Tracy et al,
    I have a LEGIT godly plate of whale. You must find it...you cant 
buy it. Stats are 72 AC, 80 DUR, +186 to AC, +96 hitpoints. Found in 
nightmare hell from a laz run. I dont wear it much because its kind 
of like having an APOC staff for a mage....makes the games a tad to 
easy.
I keep it as  more of a trophy than anything else. 

Later
SAM HAIN

P.S. It is very good against ROUGES and WARRIORS in duels.....if 
someone can hit me with a weapon while wearing GPOW than there is 
something going on...MUHAHAHA.</pre>
