<pre>I declare INFERNO officially dead, today, on all days a Friday.

Look around...no one exists except ONE person..flux-babe.

Well, flux, you were right..you would be INFERNO to the bitter end.

INFERNO did not get killed, it did not get slaughtered, it just....it 
did not even die....it basically was dissolved.

I really have nothing to say, but I think tonight of all nights 
should be a night to pay our respects to INFERNO, for once and for 
all.

Because no matter WHAT guild was on the forum, they always were 
involved with INFERNO to some degree.  Many were intrigued, many 
hated, yet all felt INFERNO whether it was good or bad.

INFERNO, I bid you a goodbye...UO is coming out, and INFERNO in 
Diablo and UO does not exist.

Flux-babe, WHAT list?  There IS no list, never WAS a list, and you 
&#34;just took email addresses off my in box.&#34;  Sorry, flux, do 
not try and deny this now...NOTHING can be done.

INFERNO was, of all things, a nice thing....some hated it, some loved 
it...it is kind of like seeing a friend die out of nowhere.....

Well, things are over.  INFERNO, I will miss you.

So, I dedicate this post to you....to your whole being.

Nevermind history, cheaters in side, lost duels, wins, good times, 
INFERNO was INFERNO.  It will always be in memory.

So, INFERNO, I basically say goodbye to you officially.

Maybe all of us should pay our respects.

Of all comments I ever heard of INFERNO, there were so many I heard 
that were just bad, just good, nice, sweet, terrible, and just all 
that...but of all the comments, the best one I ever heard came from 
some little known warrior I met.

&#34;You have to admit, INFERNO has problems, but you guys are the 
spirit of B.net.&#34;

To that level 6 warrior named Nathan, thanks, little guy.  You summed 
of INFERNO to a ever-loving T.

See ya, INFERNO.  Gonna miss you. :)

&#34;A legend is born...and then it dies.  Yet life goes on.&#34;

P.S.  Fee free to add tidbits about INFERNO...input is nice :)</pre>
