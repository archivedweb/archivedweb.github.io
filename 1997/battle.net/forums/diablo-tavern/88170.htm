&#62; Something I've been noticing lately, is a steady waning of popularity 
&#62; for this familiar character.
&#62; I used to come here, and notice his posts.  And notice that other 
&#62; people had too, from the number of flames and responses.  But ya 
&#62; know, seems to me that less people care about what he has to say.  
&#62; Maybe he should find a new forum.  Or leave and comeback after a 
&#62; while with a less annoying personality.
&#62; 
&#62; So you made 50.  Yeehaa, I made lvl 37.  And playing 8 hours a day 
&#62; (yes I did read his last post), well that is definately lame.
&#62; I dont usually play even 4 hours in a week.
&#62; 
&#62; The 20's and 30's are more fun anyway.  Fun to kill, fun to pk, fun 
&#62; to play coop and actually have a hard time getting by Laz.
&#62; 
&#62; So you made 50.  I could care less.  If its as legit as you say, good 
&#62; for you.  If it ain't: well, you know the way out.
&#62; 
&#62; Okay so this is sort of to The Man, but he don't need, get, or 
&#62; deserve no more attention.  Not from here atleast.

&#62; 
&#62;  ... for now, that's enough.  Besides, what kind of guild needs 
&#62; people who play coop one game, and then shoot a dozen fireballs at 
&#62; your back the next?  Be unpredictable.
&#62; 
&#62; Boush - 37 sorc.
&#62; Axis - 26 rogue.


You are 100&#37; correct.  TheBoy has been putting his foot in his 
mouth for months now.  He never really was *popular*, just a person 
who posted every day like 3-4 times.  People are begining to see him 
as he truly is, a big BSer, big talker, a man of no actions.  When 
people first began to question if he was a fool, he began his 'movie' 
posts. That got him a lot of attention.  Now, he has once again 
fallen below, and now he tries this 'I made level 50 for real!' crap. 
 People just don't buy it.  I know this: Surviving Hell/Hell for a 
warrior or rogue ALONE is almost impossible.  Seeing how TheBoy must 
do this OFFLINE, I find it impossible.  With limited mana, poor 
magic, and no range attack, the warrior is the toughest of all to 
battle witches and mages.  From personal experience I also know this: 
 There are times when you can come across 20-25 witches in one area.  
This is almost instant death, especially if they HellSpawn or 
SoulBurners.  I did a hell/hell run once alone with my mage.  Level 
14, there were 20 witches and about 10 Balrogs directly north of the 
stairs.  With Mana shield up I had like 800-900 mana, and max resist. 
 Guess what, I died.  It was impossible.  See, the odds are you will 
run into this, and a warrior of all people is the least prepared!  I 
did a hell/hell run with either Fist or Eugene stoning monsters for 
rogue, and it took a good hour and a half or more to clear!  Now, 
with the many, many, many, trips a warrior would need to go to town, 
with his limited mana, his crappy stone curse, it would take the 
longest time EVER for someone to do this...well, if they had Godmode, 
I image 8 hours a day, every day would help greatly.  Yawn.

Personally I am very bored with it all, and I am sure you are, too.

Later.
