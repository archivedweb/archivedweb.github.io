<pre>I found this forum back in late Feb/ early March. Back then, there 
was nothing but INFERNO posts and people who flamed INFERNO. That was 
the entire content of Ogden's tavern (with a few very notable 
exceptions). They slacked off a lot as many of the old-guard members 
left Diablo, and as people got tired of flaming them and thus they 
stopped flaming back. Sure, it's true that between Snakegod, INFERNO, 
ORM, and Tarot, we probably account for well more than half the posts 
here. But that's just because we all read this tavern every day, and 
have formed a sort of &#34;Ogden's community&#34;, as I like to think 
of it, in our own little corner of b.net. If you want to post here, 
go ahead. You have that privilidge... but so do we. No need to make 
INFERNO stop posting... they get two posts an hour each, the same as 
you, and at least their content is a lot better than some of the 
stuff this forum sees. 

Truthfully,

Lepthana
Ogden's Guardian of Truth</pre>
