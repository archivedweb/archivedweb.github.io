&#62; &#62;     About MKing...it has come to my attention that if your computer 
&#62; &#62; is not fast enough, for some people avoiding an MK can be truly 
&#62; &#62; impossible, unless they simply never go down stairs in bnet. This is 
&#62; &#62; because for some people, their computer lag is great enough that they 
&#62; &#62; die before having any chance whatsoever to take any action at all, 
&#62; &#62; whether that be teleporting, casting mana shield or escaping the 
&#62; &#62; game; they die before any action is possible. Now, a person can 
&#62; &#62; decide to never take anothers portal, but if you want to play on 
&#62; &#62; bnet, sooner or later you have to take the stairs...I guess the only 
&#62; &#62; way to truly 100&#37; make sure you don't get MK'd if you have a slow 
&#62; &#62; computer is to create bnet games yourself and be the first one down. 
&#62; &#62; This to me is another reason not to MK legits.. what say the 
&#62; &#62; battlenet public?
&#62;  
&#62; Hi there
&#62; My computer is a P120 with a 10x Cd Rom and i do have a 2 second 
&#62; delay where i can ear monsters hiting me but i cant see them or do 
&#62; anything when i arrive from another level, in my experience the most 
&#62; important thing that slow down the loading time of level is the Ram 
&#62; you have :I only have 16 and im always the last to arrive if the 
&#62; others have 32 no matter what type of computer they have.

I agree with the WisdomSeeker, RAM has a lot to do with the lag.  I 
have played with some friends and they all have different system 
configurations. I have a P100, 32 MB of RAM, 8x CD, and 52K Modem.

My freind with a P150, 32 MB RAM and a T1 Line (plays from work)and 
has a 4x CD.  I still beat him down portals because of his CD ROM.  

But the RAM your computer has plays a great part.  Have you ever 
played with someone with 64 MB of RAM, they fly!!!  They beat me down 
in half the time I take.

So my advice get your RAM updraded if you can there are some great 
deals out there, and most of all have fun playing!!!
