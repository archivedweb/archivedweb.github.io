<pre>So, I'm in channels advertising my new guild  
<a href="http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html">http://www.eecs.uic.edu/~pzakrzew/Free.html</a> when this guy called 
&#34;Blade&#34;  invites any guild leader to talk to him.  Seeing as 
I didn't have much luck in my campain (it seems that channel people 
don't really want to play much less join guilds) I went ahead and 
joined the channel that he created.  I was the only one there btw.  
So I ask him what is this all about and he starts telling me this bs 
story about how he made a web page for a clan and because of him the 
clan had more then 4000 members (or some such ridiculous number) and 
how he left it because he became a non cheater and the whole guild 
fell apart.  Then he tells me that the guild (of which I have never 
heard of and I've been lurking in Ogdent's since the Beta) had over 
25000 ears.  Bla bla bla and finally he said that he could help me 
make a web page that would make everyone want to join and then he 
asked me if I wanted this.  So I go &#34;Why don't you look at mine 
page and then give me some feed back&#34; or something like that.  So 
he goes off and after about 5 mins he comes back and goes &#34;Maybe 
you should include how to kill godmoders in your guild page&#34;.  I 
go (being an optimist) &#34;Wow&#34; in my thoughts. So then I ask 
him if its the heal other on the neg god moders that he is talking  
about.  He says no and that there is an easier way.  I go &#34;What 
is it?&#34; And he goes completley off topic and starts telling me 
that if I give him $500 he can get a server (Ha!) with 1000 email 
adresses and that he will only let legits in it. So I go &#34;Where 
the hell did you find a server for only $500?&#34; (at this point I'm 
getting a bit miffed). And he goes that he found a place that has 
them (what kind of an answer is that).  So I go &#34;I don't have 
500&#34; (and even if I did...). So the he responds &#34;well how 
much do you have?&#34;.   I go &#34;0&#34;.  And then I ask him to 
tell me how to kill godmoders.  He goes &#34;you have to get the god 
sword, with it you can kill anyone with one hit&#34;.  God sword? 
yeah right.  &#34;So where do I get this god sword?&#34; I ask. He 
responds you have to buy it at a shop (JcPenny?) but the shop keeper 
doesn't sell it anymore.&#34; &#34;So how does this help me?&#34; 
&#34;I have one and I could dupe it.&#34; So then I go &#34;but then 
the cheaters would dupe it and kill all the legits&#34; (I was 
arguing this although I didn't believe it).  Then I go &#34;are lying 
to me?&#34; or something like that.  He goes yes.  And I ask again 
about how to kill god moders and again he starts with the bs about 
casting bone spirit at a god moder and when your hit points reach 
zero (no the enemy's your hit points (don't ask me to explain this)) 
then you teleport exactly 5 paces and cast mana shield and &#34;they 
burn&#34;. Man was I getting mad now so I said &#34;bs and cya&#34; 
and I left.

To any other guild recruiters: Channels don't work and neither does 
this place, so the only place that does work is inside the actual 
game . I made a game called Recruiting Legits for clan that killes 
dupers and pk (although I had to abrieviate it). Two cheaters joined 
and one legit (not too bad odds) and the one legit is considering 
joining :)

Ps. Please join my clan I'm lonely :(</pre>
