<pre>Just what the subject says ... I expected some reaction, but didn’t 
realize it would be so upsetting to so many people. I felt the 
general slant of the post mirrored what I had seen in UO so far. I 
have never seen a single highway bandit type role-play killer, just 
bands occasionally at crossroads yelling and laughing and killing 
anything that moved. I guess I simply don’t understand the motivation 
behind , or &#34;fun factor&#34; in that. I also don’t understand 
references (in a post below) to how people can say one player is 
&#34;better&#34; then another in UO. Is a high profile warrior a 
&#34;better&#34; player then an animal trainer living alone in the 
wilderness? Put another way, if a role-playing warrior-murderer kills 
the role-playing animal trainer, is the murderer a better player? I 
don’t see any connection or relevance in that way of thinking, and 
having fun playing a game like UO. 

Statistics are funny things and highly prone to error and subjective 
interpretation. I highly doubt that survey was conducted with very 
much control or scientific method. Foxglove’s survey of Snakegod 
members was much better … and much funnier. And no, it wasn’t a slam 
to PoC. I only know one (barely) member of PoC. I understand there is 
bad blood between PoC and Snakegod … oh well, we’ll have to let those 
chips fall where they may. And no, the post wasn’t meant to be a slam 
on teenagers. I spent most of my Diablo time playing IPX with my two 
teenage sons who I respect very much. I also share computer time in 
UO with one of my teenage sons and I see he handles himself very well 
in that virtual world. 

How do I treat a killer in UO attacking me? I treat them as I do any 
other monster … fight back or flee, whatever the circumstance 
dictates. I’ve been dispatched before by a killer in UO and I wasn’t 
any &#34;deader&#34; then if I had been nailed by a Troll. 

Long and windy, I’ll not post on this subject again.

Take care, respect the other players, and have fun! 
Serina (Snakegod)

PS If ya have to be a killer, please have a little style … any of you 
remember Rev. Lovejoy? </pre>
