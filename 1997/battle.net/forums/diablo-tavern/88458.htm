<pre>Hello! If you see your name in here it's because I was picking out 
names out of Ogden's baised on what the posts said about you :)

      Arch, Arch!! Did you hear about the story of Tristram?? 
&#34;What story?&#34; Arch-Angel said. His little companion dragon 
named Riff started to explain,&#34;There's a town in the mortal world 
named Tristram in the kingdom of Khanduras, It is the city of the 
damned- or so i've herd.&#34; Arch-Angel curious of his friends tale 
asked him for more. &#34;It was a mighty town, even a city once! But 
it has fallen into the hands of evil.&#34; Arch was intersted in what 
Riff had to say. Arch in search of another adventure after the raid 
on the Hellforge with Izual The High Arch-Angel which proved fatel 
for him. &#34;What else have you heard about the Town??&#34; Arch-
Angel asked with interest. &#34;They say that the prime evils are 
dwelling in there but there's no proof, except the attacks on the 
noblemen and the children. One of the children was kidnapped and he 
had his leg amputaited by a beast.&#34; Arch feeling disgust for the 
beast had to come to Tristram to investagate. He went to the Arch-
Angel Tyrael and asked for his permission to go to the mortal relm to 
go to the town on Tristram. Tyrael stated &#34;You can only go under 
one condition, you will have all mortal attributes, no power from 
Heaven can aid you on your quest.&#34; Quickly agreing he was beamed 
to the out skirts on the Town. 

      He looked around and a sign caught his eye, It said 
&#34;Ogden's Tavern&#34; He decided to go in. Riff folowed him in. 
Therre was a few people standing in the doorway, but he managed to go 
through. As he entered the Tavern many people eyed him and sheithed 
their swords at the sight of Riff. &#34;Please leave the Dragon alone 
he means no harm.&#34; Few were sure if what Arch said was true but 
some put away their swords and daggers. Others kept them on the table 
ready to fight. Arch sat down at a table and waited for the waitress. 
The waitress came to his table and asked what drinks they would like 
Arch-Angel asked for ale and Riff asked for wine. Startled and uneasy 
by the sight of the dragon She quickly got their drinks and served 
someone else. Sa the two were drinking a shadowey figure cane to the 
table and asked if he could sit too. They said he could. He 
interduced him self, &#34;welcome new travellers my name is The 
Man.&#34; Arch-Angel introduced himself and Riff to The Man. &#34;Ah 
whats been happining here??&#34; Arch-Angel asked, The Man told them 
about the evils that dwell in the &#34;Labyrinth&#34; and a few of 
his adventures. He invited to show Arch his way around the Labyrinth 
if he wanted to. Arch accepted. 

      Inside of the Labyrinth Arch-Angel has never seen in his whole 
life of 50,000 years seen so much blood shead, with exception for the 
raid on the Hellforge. The smell was putrid but he was getting used 
to it. The Man wandered off into the shadows and dissappered. &#34;Oh 
well for him, lets have a look around.&#34; Arch and Riff started to 
explore the halls of the once church and started to put up crosses 
for those dead on the ground. Arch-Angel also said a prayer for them. 
YYeeaahhhh!! Startled from the left a monster jabbed him in the head, 
and Riff Fireballed him and the monster roasted in front of them. The 
shadows were moving behind him, whils Arch and Riff were busy The 
shadow attacked them. Riff got one of his hands burned off by the 
Fire wall, Arch-Angel jumped out of the way and stabbed the shadow 
untill he was down for the count. Riff was on the floor holding his 
charred hand. Arch tookout a Healing Potion out of his pack and 
poured it on Riff's hand. That soothed the burning and it releved the 
Dragon. Arch_then checked the attacker and found it to be The Man! 
Feeling tricked he Drgged him out into the light and then took off 
the top of a sarcophagus and wrote on it in blood &#34;DO NOT 
RESURRECT THIS MAN.&#34; Tacking Riff out of the Labyrinth and 
looking for the towns healer He came across a man that seemed very 
familer to him, it was the town's leader. He went to the healer and 
asked him if he could leave his Little friend there and the healer 
OK'd it. Arch-Angel paid peppin and  went off in search of someone 
trust worthey...

      In the Tavern he stayed and drank all he could. Then a Mage 
came up to him to offer assistance, &#34;Hello new one! Woulg you 
like to buy some spell books??&#34; Arch asked him what books did he 
have, and his reply was &#34;3 books of FireWall 4 Books of Healing, 
2 Books of Mana shield and 3 Books of Resurrect.&#34; Remembering 
about the man he bought half of the books that the mage was selling 
and Arch paid him 34,000 gold for his servises. In the corner of the 
tavern there was a group of people  sitting there cheering and 
jeering out of thier drunkness and they had no idea what they were 
talking about. Arch sat there thinking about the monster that 
encountered in the labyrinth...
