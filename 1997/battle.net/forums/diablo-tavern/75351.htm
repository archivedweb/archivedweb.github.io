<pre>Sigh.  If anyone wants to know, Acidic left INFERNO because he didn't 
have a &#34;unit&#34; under his control.  He felt that he was being 
left out.  I told him on SEVERAL occasions that we are going to wait 
until the beta before we do anything else.  For some reason he thinks 
there is actually power involved in being a unit commander, when all 
they do is help get people organized.  Why make plans for a game that 
isn't going to be out until the fall?  Yes, the full version of 
Ultima isn't going to be out until August or September.  Why make 
plans for a game that NONE of them have even played?  Sure, we can 
get ourselves organized, recruit people, but that is really all.  
Now, seeing how you have formed this guild for over a month, I have 
no choice but to declare you an enemy.  Your Power Hungry ways has 
corrupted other fools who wish to follow you.  You were a cheater in 
Diablo, someone who needed an edge in pking.  You were kicked out of 
INFERNO because of this cheating.  Then you started grasping for 
imaginary power.  You have failed to realize  that all INFERNO are 
just a band of PK.  Now, you try to stab us in the back.  
Congratulations, you are our first declared enemy for UO, and you are 
going to have to die.  Too anyone who follows him, acidic is a power 
hungry fool.  Now he has all the power he wanted, his own leader.  
Watch yourselfs.  It is good we you are coming  forward, we don't 
want people like you in INFERNO.  We only want dedicated people, who 
understand that INFERNO is nothing more than a bunch of PKs who are 
friends.  You are nothing more than a 15 year old kid who cheated in 
Diablo.  Good ridance.


Code Myster:  you are a fool.  I won't even go into how you use god 
mode to kill pks, however MK is monster kill.  There is no cheating 
involved, it is when you res someone you pked when their corpse is 
surrounded by monsters, or you 'help' damage them when they are in 
combat with monsters to 'assist' in their death.  Thus, they drop all 
their stuff when dead.  Blah, go away now.
