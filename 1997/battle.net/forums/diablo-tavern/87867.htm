&#62; I am a legit PKiller. I'm a leader of a antigod guild.
&#62; 
&#62; And thats why I can't pkill anymore.
&#62; I don't hate cheating PKillers, but what about cheating co-opers? PK 
&#62; cheaters are not ruining the game but cheat co-opers are. And why? 
&#62; Let me tell:
&#62; 
&#62; You godmode co-opers are slowly killing the playing style called 
&#62; &#34;PKilling&#34;. And what is bnet without pkillers? Are there 
&#62; anything left then? What are we going to do then!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; Last night when I was PKilling in private games I didn't got any 
&#62; ears. And I'm sure that you know why. So I am asking other pkillers:
&#62; Are you getting ears anymore? Is there are chance that you are 
&#62; playing with a nongod co-oper? Is it possible?
&#62; 
&#62; PK's may use cheats because they are not ruining the co-op playing 
&#62; style.
&#62; But cheating co-opers are!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; Do I, the PKiller, have to change the playing style? Is co-oping fun?
&#62; 
&#62; And by the way, is WYND the GREAT alive anymore?
&#62; In real life?
&#62; Is he?

&#62; Necrolyte((BB)) the Sorcerer, the one and only legit PKiller
&#62; Holder of the Medallion of great ear.
&#62; Holder of the Gold Eagle of PKilling.
&#62; Wearing 30 Gold Ribbons of Newbiekilling.
&#62; PKiller General of 5 stars.
&#62; Leader of the anti-co-op movement

&#62; CO OPERS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Legit co-oper's are not yet dead. there are still some of us out 
there for you to pkill. We are those who realize it IS just a game, 
and who-hoo! we lose an ear and some gold and have to restart in town 
after you pkill us. Big Hairy Deal. We didn't get God mode to keep 
from being pk'ed, heck, it's part of the game. I don't mind pk'ers, 
it's the cheaters that are the bane of our existances. Pk or co-op, 
they DO ruin the game for everyone. Even themselves (although most 
would deny it). Funny thing, there at the end of your post-Co-op'ers 
will never die. We are in it for the great fun and interaction of 
others, and we ALWAYS have a blast. I should say legit co-op'ers 
always have a blast. All the &#34;I'm bored with Diablo&#34; posts I 
have seen, have been written by cheaters, self proclaimed cheaters. 
Go ahead and kill us, We will always be back.
