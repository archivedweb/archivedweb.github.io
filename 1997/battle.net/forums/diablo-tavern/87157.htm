<pre>Hi,

I have gotten some complaints lately about my rather &#34;rude&#34; 
posts regarding The Man.  To those people that i have offended i am 
sorry.  To those that look at me strangely and say &#34;that is very 
uncharateristic of Snow&#34; i am also sorry.  If i have lost any 
respect from fellow guild members or old INFERNO friends i can 
understand that.  My lasts posts were totally out of whack.

However, let me show you some of the reasoning behind my actions.  A 
few days ago, i recieved some rather &#34;offending&#34; e-mail from 
The Man. In it he called me all the usual stuff plus some new insults 
that i didn't really appreciate.  Mostly low blows and cheap shots he 
was too afraid to post at ogden's because he knew the he would get 
run outta town.

So, maybe a few people can relate to why i am so angry.  Still, if, 
like The Man says, i am totally hated by INFERNO now.  I can 
understand.  If my fellow PoC members are ticked because i keep on 
violating are &#34;agreement&#34;, then i can understand their 
feelings too.  My posts insulting The Man haven't really helped the 
situation get better.

I promise i will stay away from The Man from now on.  He is not worth 
my time.

Also, flux?  Are you gonne sit around and let The Man screw your 
diplomatic relations with PoC.  Like Eugene said, if i were you i 
would kick his ass.

Later,
Tibbar-Wons
Animal of Acceptance

P.S.  Like BLZ said, no matter how much &#34;skill&#34; The Man has 
he still can't hack through GPOW.  What a lame reason.
