<pre>This is a short story with a good point intertwined within it.  Have 
fun.



     Once upon a time....long long ago....in a land far, far 
away....&#60;ahem, ahem&#62;....there were three brothers.  These 
three brothers were all famous for their various abilities.  Some 
said that they could kill dragons bare handed...others said  that the 
could kill One-Eyed giants with no more than a club.  Throughout the 
land it was agreed that these brothers were great in strength.  Yet 
no  one knew who was the better of the three...

     Until one day a competition was announced.  The town council of 
the town of which these three brothers were native decided that a 
trial of strength and endurance be proposed.  It was to be held at 
the mountain of Iandolis...a mountain which had never been climbed 
before.  Needless to say, word of this competition spread, until 
finally word got to the brothers.  They all agreed to this 
competition, and within a fort-nights time these brothers were at the 
base of the mountain.

     They were friendly with one another, and they all believed that 
this was simply a friendly competition with one another, and that 
they didn't feel the need to prove themselves to anyone for their 
legends have been spread throughout the land.  No, no one had 
anything to prove...except maybe to themselves.

     And in the evening at the base of the mountain, a wraith 
appeared before the three brothers.  It said that the gods had 
decided to intervine into this competition...and that the gods have 
declared it so these brothers will die on tomorrows eve.  The wraith 
told them that they only had one day to do whatever it was that they 
wished...then just as suddenly as the wraith appeared,it vanished.  
The brothers were stunned.  An eerie silence fell over their 
campfire...until the first brother spoke.

&#34;I have no wish to die tomorrow.  But if it is to be that Death 
will come for me tomorrow, then so be it.  I will go and find the 
most beautiful maidens in the town and bed them.  Yes, that is what I 
shall do.&#34;  So the first brother left the camp.

And then the second brother spoke...

&#34;And if it is to be that I too shall die tomorrow...I shall go 
gamble, and try to win a fortune in one day's time.&#34;  And so the 
second brother left the camp.

     The third brother was left at the camp...and he was silent with 
thought for a while.  And then, to no one but himself, he said...

&#34;I will climb the mountain.  Yes, that is what I shall do.&#34;

And with that, the third brother left the camp.


----And thus concludes my story, I hope you liked it.  Please post 
ANY feedback.

I know who the greatest of the three brothers was.....</pre>
