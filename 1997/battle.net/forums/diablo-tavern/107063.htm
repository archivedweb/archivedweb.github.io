&#62; &#62; &#62; This was posted on LaWizards Chatzone by a person named SF. I found 
&#62; &#62; &#62; it very interesting. Maybe you will too.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Not me.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 97&#37; were male
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Yep.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Hmmm, define social life.  I have friends and we go to concerts and 
&#62; &#62; see movies and stuff, so I guess I have one.  Girlfriend, no, but 
&#62; &#62; only by choice, not for lack of willing candidates :)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
&#62; &#62; &#62; cards taken from parents wallets.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Hell no.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
&#62; &#62; &#62; paranoia.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Paranoia?  Who wants to know?  Why are you asking, huh??  You're 
&#62; &#62; from the CIA aren't you?  WELL I'M NOT TELLING YOU IF I'M PARANOID 
&#62; &#62; YOU GOVERNMENT SPOOK!  (hehe)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 80&#37; leaned towards depression. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Yeah, so?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Er, speeding ticket?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
&#62; &#62; &#62; instability, even to the point of needing
&#62; &#62; &#62; mental treatment. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   SO WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM??  You wanna make something of it 
&#62; &#62; man?  Why are you looking at me that way?  SPOON!!!  No I won't take 
&#62; &#62; you to my leader alien scum!  I DON'T HAVE A LEADER!  Just, just, 
&#62; &#62; just, leave me alone man.....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62;Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
&#62; &#62; &#62; feelings through this use of virtual killing.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   I'm sure I have feelings somewhere around here.  Now where did I 
&#62; &#62; put those damn feelings?  HERE FEELINGS, COME HERE! *whistles*
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
&#62; &#62; &#62; they feel this release from real life. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   That's the whole point of computer games, isn't it????
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62;If they die.. it
&#62; &#62; &#62; means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
&#62; &#62; &#62; again.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Not true in UO.  It's a serious setback and one that I would very 
&#62; &#62; much like to avoid.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
&#62; &#62; &#62; makes it more costly to perform PK, the
&#62; &#62; &#62; problem will just become greater. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Who says it's a &#34;problem&#34;?  Is role-playing an evil 
&#62; &#62; character a problem?  Oh, sorry.  I thought this was a role-playing 
&#62; &#62; game.  My mistake.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Maverick
&#62; &#62; Who says I'm unstable?
&#62; 
&#62; HELLO, STUPID,  if your too ignorant to figure out what the article 
&#62; is saying, then do the online gaming world a favor and cancel your 
&#62; ISP and sell your computer so that someone who can grasp concepts 
&#62; will understand what the article was saying.  For you dipsh!t I will 
&#62; spell it out.  Read carefully, read 2 times if it helps.
&#62; 
&#62; A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY UO AS A PK'R ARE NOT ROLEPLAYING.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm not sure, I'm not as allknowingly smart as you, but I don't 
&#62; believe the article said &#34;Maverick is a PK, so he is a under 16, 
&#62; stealing, misfit.&#34;  Do yourself a favor and quit taking all these 
&#62; things so personal.... Or is it that because some of these things are 
&#62; hitting so close to home that it really bothers you.....   Makes one 
&#62; wonder....
&#62; 
&#62; Novotny(Snakegod)
&#62; 
&#62; I included the snide remarks as a way to relate to the way 
&#62; &#34;SOME&#34; of the pk types respond in their messages to people 
&#62; who make a mistake.  It's pretty easy to do when you don't think of 
&#62; what your going to say before you say it....</pre>
