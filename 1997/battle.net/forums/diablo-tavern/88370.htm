&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I gained 1.25 million by....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Killing about 130 enemies or so.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; That is 1.25, maybe closer to 1.26, million experience points.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You gain 10K (1000*10=10000) experience per enemy.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Gosh, people, do the math.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Man
&#62; 
&#62; Here you say you get 10K per kill.  NOW Earlier you said:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;&#62;&#62;Ask Blizzard.  You DO get to level 50 legitly.
&#62; 
&#62;               When you hit level 49, you gain about 10 Experience 
&#62; from monsters.  
&#62;               No joke.  Anyone who is legit level 48+ knows you 
&#62; actually gain 10K 
&#62;               experience or so Level 13 to Level 16 on Hell Mode.
&#62; 
&#62;               You can think I cheated all you want, like YOUR opinion 
&#62; matters, PoC. 
&#62;               If it did, you would be working for Blizzard and not 
&#62; playing a game.
&#62; 
&#62;               I talked to Blizzard, you CAN get to Level 50 
&#62; Legitly....those Level 
&#62;               48 or above, try it.  Playing 8 hours a day you can 
&#62; easily reach it.
&#62; 
&#62;               The Man
&#62; 
&#62;               &#34;People doubt me....should I care?&#34;
&#62; 
&#62;               P.S.  Great, BLZ, Curunir, you don't like me....I wish 
&#62; I cared.  And 
&#62;               Morte?  Good..proves you have guts, even for a 
&#62; spineless twit. 
&#62; :)&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;
&#62; 
&#62; WHO is the Moron The Man?  In your originl post your stupid foot went 
&#62; right into your mouth of BS.  Fact of the matter is you got NO 
&#62; FRICKING CLUE how much exp a legit level 49 gets, cause you were 
&#62; NEVER there.  In your original post you said 10 exp PER MONSTER 10K 
&#62; PER HELL RUN LEVEL 13-16.  Now, I knew this would be your defense.  
&#62; This is called a classic covering of one's ass.  However, I got more 
&#62; news for ya all.  Lets just say that The Man 'made a mistake'.  Wahh. 
&#62;  Ok, now, lets say that in one hour time The Man could get about 1 
&#62; million exp.  To go from level 49-50 you need how much?  Roughly 225 
&#62; million exp.  That is about 225 Hours.  Or Roughly 10 days.  HOWEVER, 
&#62; that is playing straight.  If the man played 8 hours straight a day, 
&#62; every day, it would take him about 28 days to get that EXP.  28 days 
&#62; at 1 million exp per hour, 8 hours a day, 28 days straight.  Now, it 
&#62; took the man no more than 10-14 days.  YOU are the fool the man.  
&#62; Back to playing my game.
&#62; 
&#62; TL
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;When you hit level 49 you gin about 10 experience from monsters. 
&#62;  No joke&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;It is 10K, not 10.  Do the math.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; -------The Man.

Please Tracy..he made a error in the text..I could sit there and tell 
you at level 49 you gain about 10k..if you didn't know that then its 
sad....</pre>
