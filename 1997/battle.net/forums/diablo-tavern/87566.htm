Laz Run, Behind the Scenes

	&#34;Oh damn, not again!! We just finished a set! Don't these clowns 
ever get tired?&#34; sighed Blackjade as she moved off  toward her 
dressing area. &#34;I haven't even had time to eat my lunch yet!&#34;
	&#34;Stop complaining and get dressed! These are all Level 35 and 
above characters so they shouldn't take to long to get here. I 
recognize a couple of them. They usually just come directly down if 
they can find the stairs.&#34; Lazarus spoke from experience.
	Just then Bloodlust walked in carrying a milkshake in one hand and a 
cheeseburger in the other. A slight drip of catsup trickled down from 
her lips. Her hair was up in curlers and her robe was slightly 
disheveled. &#34;Couldn't I just not be there, they usually don't 
find me anyway. All they want is to find your room Laz and then 
leave. Jeez, they could just create Level 15 and skip all of the 
others, most of them would be just as happy!!&#34; She proceeded to 
take a big bite from her burger and slouched into a chair by the door.
	&#34;Lusty, they quite often hunt you down. You're almost as popular 
as Jade and Red Vex!&#34;
	&#34;That Vex can be such a slu....&#34;  her sentence was cut short 
by Red Vex sauntering into the room from her dressing room.
	&#34;Hi guys. I hear we have another run starting. Well I just can't 
do it. I just put my g-string in the dryer and I didn't bring my 
extra one with me today.&#34; Red Vex said flatly.
	&#34;Vex, you have to go on. We can't do the gig without you. How 
would that look?&#34; Lazarus was trying to make his point.
	&#34;Well, exactly how do you expect me to do it, in my robe?&#34; 
came the sharp retort from Red Vex.
	&#34;Can't you borrow one from one of the other girls, just for this 
 show?&#34; Laz asked trying to settle the overwrought witch down. 
&#34;Surely one of the others has a spare they can loan you&#34;
	&#34;I'm not wearing a g-string from any of them&#34; Vex stated. 
&#34;They are all a bunch of cows&#34; she thought to herself.
	Lazarus threw his hands in the air and headed for his dressing room. 
&#34;Working with this bunch is enough to kill a guy!!&#34; he 
thought.
	The monitor at the head of the large room was now filling with the 
names of all of the cast and where their beginning marks would be. 
The sign flashed &#34;3 Minutes until show time&#34;.
	&#34;That's our cue gang, let's hit it!&#34; shouted Lazarus as he 
exited his dressing room, fully clad in his ornate robes and carrying 
the large carved staff of the Archbishop. He could see all of the 
extras moving down the hall outside the bosses room. &#34;Quite a big 
crowd, maybe it will take a while to get to us&#34; he mused.
	&#34;I'm not going on!&#34; Red Vex was very adamant about it. 
&#34;I refuse to the do the show naked and no one else has my 
figure.&#34;
	&#34;I beg you pardon, Vexie!&#34; the response came from Bloodlust, 
&#34;I have every bit as good a figure as you, maybe even better!&#34;
	&#34;Dream on Lust. They chase me all over the dungeon, bet they 
don't do that to you!&#34; Red Vex taunted.
	&#34;Yes they do!!&#34;
	The two locked stares in the middle of the room, neither backing 
down.
	A claxon sounded signaling that they only had one minute to take 
their places.
	&#34;Move it girls!&#34; shouted Lazarus as he headed out the door 
into the hall that led to the Level 15 elevator. He could still hear 
the two witches arguing as he reached the elevator doors.
	There beside the doors as always was a large box containing weapons, 
books, armor, rings, amulet, anything one of the adventuring fools 
might want. Most of the time they were provided with trashy stuff to 
carry on the gig, but occasionally management would actually drop 
something nice in the box.
	&#34;Not very often&#34; mumbled Lazarus as he reached into the box 
and pulled out an old weathered book. &#34;This will teach them to 
come down so often!!&#34; there was a  gleam in his eyes as he said 
that.
	He looked back down the hall and saw the three witch bosses coming 
toward him, all three shouting at the same time, none listening to 
the others. He couldn't make out what Red Vex  was wearing, but 
Bloodlust still had the milkshake and burger in her hands.
	&#34;Lose the food, Lusty. You know there is no food allowed in the 
dungeon. It's a safety violation. I've heard of adventurers slipping 
on wrappers and filing suit against Diablo over it. I still think the 
wrapper was dropped by another gamer. I've seen at least one bringing 
Twinkies into the dungeon!&#34;
	&#34;I have to finish my lunch.&#34; said Bloodlust, &#34;Anyway 
they won't find me for a few minutes. I'll put the trash in a barrel. 
No one will find it there. Laz, baby, could you just slip a little 
old ring into my sash here and don't get fresh!!!&#34;
	&#34;I have to find another job, that's all there is to it!&#34; Laz 
thought as he picked a ring from the box and slipped it carefully 
into Bloodlust's belt.
	Red Vex reached for a bastard sword from the box at the same instant 
as Blackjade.
	&#34;I got it first!&#34; sneered Blackjade.
	&#34;No, I did!&#34; shouted Red Vex back at her.
	The claxon sounded again signifying that the adventurers had enter 
Level 13.
	&#34;We have to be getting in place , Now!&#34; he shouted the word 
‘now', trying to stop the two witches from arguing and get them in 
place. The way things were going he might kill the witches himself 
before the gamers arrived. &#34;You two stop fighting over that 
stupid sword. Vex take something else and let's move!&#34;
	Red Vex shot first Blackjade and then Lazarus a filthy glance and 
grabbed a robe from the box. &#34;This is a real piece of trash.&#34; 
she smiled to herself, &#34;if they want to mess with me, I'll fix 
them!&#34;
	The monitor mounted on the wall next to the elevator showed the band 
of four gamers had already found the stairs to Level 14 and were not 
far from the Level 15 stairs.
	&#34;Move it, move it&#34; screamed Lazarus at the bickering witches.
	A loud slurping sound came from Bloodlust as she had nearly finished 
her milk shake. For the first time Lazarus noticed that she still had 
the curlers in her hair.
	&#34;Lusty, the curlers!!&#34;
	&#34;Oh, yeah, I forgot about them. Here Laz hold my burger for me, 
I'll get them out&#34; Bloodlust said as she pulled the curlers from 
her hair and stashed them in her belt. She fluffed her hair a little 
.&#34;There, better?&#34; she asked as she retrieved the burger from 
Laz's hand.
	&#34;Sure&#34;
	The elevator doors opened and the four stepped in and Laz pressed 
the button for Level 15. Within a few seconds they exited the 
elevator into the Level 15 staging area. There was mass chaos as 
hundreds of extras bustled about trying to find their initial 
location. A number of directors were trying to organize the 
confusion, but were having little success.
	&#34;Boy am I glad I'm a boss. At least we get special hoists that 
put us in place each game, none of this running about to find your 
mark&#34; Lazarus mused as he strapped himself into his hoist seat.
	He could see Red Vex and Blackjade were still arguing as they sat 
into their hoist chairs and were gently lifted up to be placed on the 
set. His eyes moved to the large progress monitor mounted on one wall 
and noted that the group had just begun to descend the stairs to 
Level 15. They would be cutting it close. He could see that Bloodlust 
still had a few bites of her burger left as they hovered over the 
room that they always inhabited. 
	It had been cleaned up since the last show, but he could still see 
bits of debris around the alter. He would have to complain to 
housekeeping about that.
	&#34;What difficulty is this?&#34; asked Red Vex.
	&#34;Hell&#34; replied Lazarus as they set the spell level on their 
equipment to ‘Hell'. At least they could pelt these fools with a 
powerful jolt, not that whimpy stuff they had to use at normal 
difficulty seting.
	He could hear the sounds of battle, grunts from warriors, fireballs 
exploding and that little scream that the witches make when slain. 
They were just going to make it.
	The hoists began to lower them into position.
	As their feet touched the floor, Bloodlust looked about for a barrel 
into which to place the wrapper from her burger. There were no 
barrels in the alter room, never had been. She quickly tossed it 
behind the alter and ran to take her place elsewhere in the dungeon.
	&#34;No one will look there.&#34; she said.
	Laz just shook his head.
	&#34;Places!&#34; he shouted, just as a plate clad warrior peered 
around the corner of the doorway.
	Action!!!

              ....................................

	The cast was laughing hard as they returned to the bosses lounge 
after the gig.
	&#34;Did you see the look on that warrior's face when Lusty dropped 
those ‘Godly Curlers of the Ages'&#34; laughed Laz as they all 
grabbed a beer and flopped onto the couches laughing hardily. 
	Suddenly there was the loud sound of a claxon.
	&#34;NO!!!!!!!!&#34;</pre>
