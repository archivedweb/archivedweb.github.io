<pre>well, his is my post from earlier, i think i made some
good points, and would like to know what you think
about this theory about what really happened

&#62; notice that before i posted to defend you, yesterday,
&#62; people were signing the petition like crazy, afterwards,
&#62; only about 10 people replied to it, and half were against
&#62; the banning.  i personally put a stop to this damn witchhunt,
&#62; and i better be getting my lawyer's fee in the mail soon.
&#62; mail it to :
&#62; 
&#62; Johnny Cochran
&#62; dgjdsjf st.
&#62; kusgf California slkghl
&#62; 
&#62; hehe
&#62; 
&#62; well, i still don't think you did it.  why would talon
&#62; post this crap, deny it, apologized, and then deny it 
&#62; again?  it just doesn't make sense.  
&#62; 
&#62; i think that a third party was involved.  i think that this is 
&#62; what really happened:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  some lamer, neither theman nor talon, decided
&#62; to play a stupid little joke make theman look bad,
&#62; and posted the offending post.
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  theman let's his hatred for talon cloud his judgement,
&#62; and without thinking, blames talon.  

isn't that like him?
 
&#62; 3.  everyone let's their hatred for talon cloud their judgement,
&#62; and almost everyone blames talon, even though they
&#62; saw absolutely no evidence.  everyone simply said, &#34;me
&#62; too, don't leave me out!&#34;

bnet seems to be full of followers these days, people
who just follow other people's lead.
 
&#62; 4.  the imposter, still trying to cause trouble, posted
&#62; as talon, and blamed theman.


 
&#62; 5.  theman, denies it, and blames the real talon, again.
&#62; 
&#62; 6.  the petition get's started, everyone  (except a few
&#62; people) get tricked, and signs it. 
&#62; 
&#62; 7.  the imposter, knowing he can no longer trick anyone 
&#62; get people to think theman did it, gets another idea-- go 
&#62; along with this and get talon in trouble.  how did he
&#62; play along?  he posted as talon this time, and
&#62; apologized, knowing no one would accept the apology.
&#62; this way, it would seem like talon admitted it, without
&#62; flat-out giving away the imposter's secret.

this is pretty smart.  if i were in the same situation, i
would have done the same thing as the imposter.  
at this point, he is trying to save his efforts to cause trouble
in ogdens.
 
&#62; 8.  theman says that since talon said sorry, he must have
&#62; done it.  this was the imposter's intention when he did
&#62; #7.

he fell for #7
 
&#62; 9.  talon returns home, sees all this and denies that it was
&#62; him. 

remember, when the fake talon apologized, he promised
not to post till tuesday.  and a few hours later, the real
talon posted to deny it.  it would not makes sense
if talon apologized, then denied it.  it also wouldn't
make sense if he promised not to make another
post until tuesday, and then posted two hours later.
 
&#62; this was my best theory, given all the evidence.  think about
&#62; it, the writing style of the imposter is nothing like
&#62; that of talon.  if you want an example, look at some of
&#62; my posts from yesterday, i think there is ample evidence there.
&#62; theman did NOT do this to frame talon.  he could not
&#62; have posted 3 times in two hours.  in conclusion,
&#62; if it was neither of them, it there had to be a third party.
&#62; 
&#62; well, that was my conspiracy theory, tell me what you think.
&#62; the only way i might have missed is if theman has two
&#62; isp's, in which case, he COULD have framed talon.
&#62; 
&#62;                                           URFRIEND
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Save the Juice!&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; please finish this quote:
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;If the glove does not fit, you must ___________&#34;


well, this is THE BEST theory i have heard or come up
with yet, given all the evidence.  please respond and
tell me what you think.  where are the weak/strong points 
to my argument?  i have tried to remain objective about
this, so i think i have made the best possible theory
given the evidence.
