<pre>I would like to thank you guys for hating me.  To quote a movie I 
recently saw &#34;What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.&#34;  
You guys are not pathetic, I guess you have lives.  But in this game, 
you ARE pathetic.

nIGHT:  A washed up Tarot member, with nothing to do.  I don't duel 
cheating Tarot members, nIGHT.  You can relate with that, my dark 
little friend in Christ.  Your insults are about as tough as 
Talon's..those his are funnier.  But you want to be the Official 
INFERNo Toliet Bowl Cleaner...hey, I insist. :)

Anubisan:  I think you know what I think of you, and I know what you 
think of me.  But we are NEVER going away.  Tought luck for us both, 
Andy.

Wolfman:  Good to have fans that are really just &#34;another face in 
the crowd.&#34;  Keep up the negative press.  The more I get, the 
more attention I get, and that fuels the ego problem. :)  But do 
yourself a favor and actuall &#34;post a reply&#34; and not just make 
a headline.  I need to read, not look at posts headlines.  What, 
can't type? :)

Eugene:  I know you are now just a slave to INFERNO and a washed up 
former great yourself, but why be bitter?  You are dead, Eugene.  No, 
I am not saying &#34;You are dead because I am going to kill 
you.&#34;  You died from lack of posts and lack of interest.  I mean, 
give me a break, man, I thought you were cool.  Guess I was wrong. :) 
 Oh well, you know how you are.  Whenever you get over hating people, 
give me a call.  Because I can sense you have too much time on your 
hands, among other things. :)

Fuknsoul:  Hehehehe.  This person, a former INFERNO friend, was 
caught cheating, duping items, using duped items, and hacking his ACC 
number while Tyrael and I were watching, and he also denied it and 
tried to &#34;spy on INFERNO.&#34;  So, I needed to take him down a 
few notches...and it worked.  He retired, but came back.  Oh well, I 
have time to put him back where he belongs...off B.net. :)

The Godly Soul:  This guy kind of hates me.  More of like I accused 
him of cheating, (he does, by the way) and he took offense.  Oh well. 
I need my fans, and he is a good one. :)  He is not even to be on UO, 
so I really do not care with him. :)

Talon:  Sticky Ricky, Sex-Rogue, goes by many names.  The Merchant 
guild...haha.  Isn't it ironic?  Don't you think? :)  Not a bother.  
Just another target.  Nothing to worry about, he could not hurt a 
tickle me elmo. :)

Random:  A high talking person who has almost loss all of his brains. 
 I beat him once while &#34;smurfing&#34; (See Shlonglor's Warcraft 2 
Page for that) and I beat him.  He took offense.  Ever since then, he 
has been found out of cheating, and everyone agrees, and he has 
insults to me that would make the rest of you laugh.  Hehe, oh well.  
You know what they say...some people just want attention. (But I 
should talk, huh? :)

KoR Guild:  They are generally washed up.  Nothing more to say. :)

BLG Guild:  See above. :)

Well, I have several other fans that I cannot quite think of, but you 
know what guys, I love all of you.

Maybe all of you should team up...then maybe you can insult me 
without sounding like five year olds.  Think about it. :)

The Man (UO-INFERNO)

&#34;What can I say?  I'm a jerk.&#34;

P.S.  No matter what you do or say or even try against me, fans...I 
am NEVER going away. :)  So, don't even try.  But you know you want 
to prove me wrong, so go right ahead. :)  I am not going anywhere.</pre>
