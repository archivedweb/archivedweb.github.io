&#62; BLZ, nothing you can say is going to make me let up.  NOTHING.

No one cares if you let up. People are just trying to find out
if you are as bad as you say you are. If you are, simply prove it!
Make all us doubters eat our own words.

&#62; I duel LOTS, and if I don't want to duel a few cheaters and someone 
&#62; trying to say they beat me, then why not just mind your own &#62; 
business?

So you only duel when you know you will win? I am still waiting
for anyone to come forward and say they have seen you in a 
game!

&#62; 
&#62; I mean, I don't hurt anyone, do I? (nevermind that one)

neither does a mosquito, but if it annoys me enough, I kill it.

&#62; I pk, I duel, and when you see me in action, I am pretty damn good.  
&#62; Provoking me does nothing.  I deal with actual &#34;smart&#34; and 
&#62; &#34;important&#34; people in real life and I do quite well, in fact, 
&#62; I do damn well.

Umm, saying you are good and being good are 2 different things.
The problem is nobody has &#34;seen you in action&#34;. All I am 
asking
for is a little demonstration.

&#62; And through this anti-pk, anti-INFERNO, anti-TheMan stuff, I ALWAYS 
&#62; stay and hold my ground.

You change your stance more than the wind changes! You started your
bnet life, flaming/cloning inferno members. Now you wanna be the
leader. There are many cases where you were caught publicly
in a lie, and you simply changed ground!
 
&#62; So, if you just cannot handle me attacking your precious guild of 
&#62; Quitters (By invitation only, I might add), then maybe you should 
&#62; quit posting on the forum.

Umm... hello?? BLZ was not even in inferno. How can he be a quitter?
And if you cant handle being poked fun at because you are all talk,
than maybe you should just stick to chat.

&#62; You can try and tear ANYTHING I say apart, but it does no good.

It does make you look funny ;)
 
&#62; No one can ever get rid of me.  Especially not a quitter's guild, a 
&#62; few cheaters who like to post, a guild of three friends who are a 
&#62; &#34;tad&#34; bit to close, if you know what I mean, lots of two-bit 
&#62; pks (SnowRabbit rings a bell), a cloning rocker name, a wise-ass fat 
&#62; kid, and someone who thinks they can post whatever they want and it 
&#62; is law.

Man, that list is getting long. Everyone who wants
to see what you are made of is some type of loser huh?
You are running out of excuses theman. 

&#62; 
&#62; When you guys get good, give me a call.  I guess I have some time, 
&#62; then. :)

How about now. Duel me. Name the time. 

&#62; And Silencer, Curunir, and all of the other associated ilk can flame 
&#62; me, spam me, and do whatever they want....I am not leaving.

I could care less if you leave or stay. I just want to see if you
are a liar. prove me wrong. Meet me in a duel.

&#62; Because if I actually CARED what you people said, I would maybe 
&#62; actually &#34;listen&#34; to you.  I don't.

Haha, If you did not care, you would not post about it.

&#62; BLZ, I like you, we had some fun times, so be smart, stay the hell 
&#62; out of my way.

OR ELSE WHAT!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!

you'll give him another verbal thrashing like this one! &#60;heavy 
sarcasm&#62;
 
&#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;What can I say?  I'm a jerk.&#34;

No, you are a coward and a liar.
