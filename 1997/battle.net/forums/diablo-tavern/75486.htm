<pre>I have just quit Inferno but I have been recruiting for my clan for 
the last month. Hysteria is the new Clan for active members.
We have 25 member so far, only just finished the web site.  
I have heard the Hell Knights of Inferno will been disbanded, there 
site is still up.
Inferno doesn't have 400 members, that is a JOKE!
They have about 50-60 members, and lie about there numbers so they 
can try and recruit more members.
And without the Hell Knights they won't have even have over 100 
members. 
 

If you thought Inferno was boring, slugish, inactive.  Then you were 
correct, they have no means of communication, they don't even list 
there members for crying out loud!...That is how much they care about 
there members I presume.

You can't play Ultima Online the same way as you played Diablo.  You 
need the whole clan to work as one.
They have no backup for when division leaders are not online, which 
will be very common I'm sure.

If you would like to join Inferno a clan that is not planing anything 
specific for UO, that is sitting back and waiting for the final 
release before they organize some way of communication.  Then be it 
on your Head, when you can't find you fellow members because you 
don't even know there names.   Its a JOKE! 
And if by chance you know there names, then you can start your search 
of UO for them, might only take you a few hours or so if your lucky.


If you have read all this and want something better.
Cut and Paste this URL and visit Hysteria's Clan page, I promise you 
this clan is going places.
