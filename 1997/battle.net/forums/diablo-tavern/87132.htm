<pre>Ok TheMan,

I've been watching enough of your crap to plainly see why
you were kicked from INFERNO in the first place. You got taken
back after TL and others left, and you are attempting to
run the show. You have just proven beyond all shadow of
doubt that the reasons given for your expulsion were factual.

Second, you speak of loyalty. Loyalty to your guild. What 
about loyalty to your friends? Hello?? This is still a game
after all. And I would rather belong to a group of friends
who have fun, than to a guild with a familiar (although now tainted) 
name.

Now as of right now, I am completely unbiased. I have friends in 
both INFERNO and in PoC. But you are making INFERNO look like a 
very bad joke. You talk so much, but you never back anything up.
It makes you look ridiculous. Now IMHO, Eugene talks a lot
of trash too. The BIG difference is, he'll back it up in
the dungeons. It gives him a little more credibility than
someone who sits in a chat channel, and posts messages
to imaginary friends.

Now, you wanna get some respect. You want to be taken seriously,
duel someone. Anyone other than your imaginary friends. Duel me.
Duel my lvl 24 warrior, should be a cakewalk for a lvl 49. He doesn't
even have teleport yet. I just want to see if you will actually
leave the channel for a couple minutes to duel. Or are you gonna
call me a cheater too?

Silencer</pre>
