<blockquote>
<pre>I often think I am the only person whose mind works the way mine 
does, but here goes an attempt to translate my inner thoughts into 
something coherent.

The world is going in the right direction.  Despite what you might 
read in the paper, see on TV, or hear from others, the world is going 
in the right direction.  I see corporate advertising, but don't pay 
attention to the things that don't interest me.  I see damage to the 
environment, but realize that the world is more flexible than we tend 
to believe.  I see world culture appearing to dissolve into evil and 
wickedness, but know that there are still good people out there.

I'm not saying that things are perfect, but I am saying that there's 
no reason to lose heart.  When I see ads I see the jobs that people 
have making those ads and earning money to take care of themselves 
and their families.  When I see automobiles on the road, I think how 
much cleaner they are than horses were a hundred years ago (believe 
me on this, but if you don't read up on how bad things were back then 
with the problems that horses presented).  I especially think about 
how much cleaner autos are now than they were fifty years ago.

When I see a strong military, I see a well-defended country that 
cares about protecting its citizens from external threats.  I see an 
institution that can serve a purpose for good as well as evil, but 
depends upon the aims of those who hold the reigns of power.

I also see the problems you worry about, but I view them as problems 
with a solution as opposed to irreparable fissures in our culture.  
Our country, and the rest of the Western world, has done a damn fine 
job of trying to destroy itself through stupidity, hedonism, and a 
lack of morals.  But there are plenty of people who still live their 
lives the way they should.  And it's the example they lead by just 
doing things right in whatever little way they can that will make the 
difference in the long run.

You see, there is a guiding force out there behind the apparent loss 
orf morality and decline in our world.  That force, evil, has been 
with us since the beginning of time.  Call it whatever you want, 
depending on your beliefs it has different names.  However, though it 
occasionally holds sway, evil never wins forever.  There are too many 
good people to fight it.  As long as enough of us care, as long as 
enough of us do what we can, what is good and righteous will triumph 
in the end.

But there certainly are those who live immoral lives, who are selfish 
and greedy, who look out only for themselves and no one else.  Sadly, 
there are many of them, but they are by no means the majority.  The 
best way they can be fought is for the rest of us to live the best 
lives we can.  Even if you only do a very small thing to help, it's 
not really what you do or even how much of it.  The little things are 
what count in this instance.  If your life consists of merely 
watching TV, playing computer games, and working, that is enough 
provided you live a good and moral life.  We can't all be super-
volunteer....

I, for one, am glad to be alive in this day and age.  Disease is a 
small hindrance as opposed to a daily threat, with medicine being so 
advanced that our average lifespan is over twice what it was when the 
United States became a country.  Computers and telephones add great 
entertainment and convenience to life.  Automobiles make for a mobile 
and more free society.  Air conditioning and heating keep 
temperatures at bearable levels in both freezing winter and burning 
summer.  It's easier than ever before to travel and see the wonders 
the world has to offer.

My hopes are that this made at least some sense and didn't ramble too 
much.  I tend to get a little chaotic when putting down my thoughts 
on this type of topic (hey, look at the name I chose).  Heck, in my 
life I don't contribute tons of hours of community service or spend 
weekends helping out at the local Rescue Mission.  But I do what I 
can where I think it helps the most.  Just don't lose hope becuase 
you are only shown the bad side of life.  The flip side is usually 
there if you look for it, and almost always better than you'd think.  
I once was very pessimistic as well, but after really spending time 
and thinking about it, I realized that I could give up hope and spend 
the rest of my life already dead and waiting for it to be confirmed, 
or choose to find the good in life and really LIVE.  

To make a long post short (too late!), life is what you make of it.  
The earth isn't going to melt into a puddle of trash and goo anytime 
soon, but neither is it going to be a wonderful place to live unless 
we choose to and constantly work to make it that way.
