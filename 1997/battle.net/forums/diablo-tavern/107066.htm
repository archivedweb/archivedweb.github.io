<pre>This was posted on the Snakegod Message Board by a person named 
Foxglove. I found it very interesting. Maybe you will too.

Well.. I was not going to post about this, but it seems I have to. 

A close clan member is a well established accountant, and also a 
former player of UO. The character in the game fit the real
person to a T - he went around knitting skullcaps, searching the 
ground for spawning reagents, and interviewing fellow
Snakegods (after the dungeon crawl, but since this character never 
had much swordplay skill it didn't really matter).

These are the results, and I might mention, you should take them 
seriously.

70&#37; of the SG'ers interviewed were over the age of 21 (but nearly 
80&#37; had a &#34;4th Grade Sense of Humor&#34;).
97&#37; were male (or appeared to be - at least one had switched 
genders recently).
75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
85&#37; were playing without their childrens' knowledge, using credit 
cards taken from their spouses' wallets/purses.

Those are hard facts, gleaned from the SG'ers themselves, from 3 
different servers. These are deductions made from an
established CPA. 

ALL of the SG'ers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
foolishness.
80&#37; leaned towards complete lunacy.
75&#37; exhibited a peculiar fetish (leather chaps in particular). 
70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the Queen. 
There are other catagories covered, but most fall under the 40 to 20 
percentage, so I won't show them.

What the outcome of this was, that SG'ers, as a breed, are making up 
for serious, real life shortcomings by
acting out cooperative actions in a fantasy world where there is no 
fear of real life retribution. These shortcomings could stem
from anything from failing computer systems, to nonexistent asses, to 
unexpected hormone surges. Some of the SG'ers,
however, leaned towards dangerous levels of sleep depravation, even 
to the point of needing megadoses of caffeine (thanks,
Jimi). Most of the SG'ers have feelings, but are hiding their true 
feelings through this use of virtual cooperation.

It matters very much to them what the other people are feeling - just 
that they feel this release from real life. If they die.. it
means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to co-op 
again. 

The Internet itself has always tended to be a haven for people with 
severe problems. People can act out
whatever they wish because they feel safe behind the keyboard. That 
is, unless Lohlander is on their tail.

One thing is certain, unless game makers, (Blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
makes it more costly to co-op, the
problem will just become greater. 

There are exeptions, however; we did meet a few people who were 
actually &#34;roleplaying&#34; the kind, helping warrior, but most
of the people who were SG'ing did it without thinking.

Also, important to note, about 15&#37; were SG'ing because in their 
opinion, it was the best way to get more
on-line friends. When asked why they needed more on-line friends, we 
were told, to meet more people to get more on-line
friends. When asked why again, we were told, because, its the only 
way to &#34;catch a spanking from Petunia.&#34;

Go figure.

And before you flame me, take a moment to think about it. if you 
still want to flame me, you must be a SG'er who felt this hit a
little to close to home.

Good day.

Now I don't know how many people this individual actually sampled, 
but I don't find anything above to be all that surprising.
Do you?

Take care,
Lepthana (Snakegod)

&#62; Well.. I was not going to post about this. but it seems I have to. 
&#62; 
&#62; A close family member is a well established psychologist, and also a 
&#62; part-time player of UO. The character in the game
&#62; fits the real person to a T. Goes around and &#34;Intervues&#34; 
&#62; Pkers. (after the killing spree, but since this character never
&#62; carries anything it doesnt matter.)
&#62; 
&#62; This is the results, and I might mention, you should take it 
&#62; seriously.
&#62; 
&#62; 80&#37; of the pkers intervued were under the age of 16.
&#62; 97&#37; were male
&#62; 75&#37; had no girlfriend or social life.
&#62; 85&#37; were playing without their parents knowledge, using credit 
&#62; cards taken from parents wallets.
&#62; those are hard facts, Gleaned from the PKers themselfs, From 3 
&#62; different servers.
&#62; These are deductions made from an established psychologist.
&#62; ALL of the PKers talked to showed tendencies of minor to severe 
&#62; paranoia.
&#62; 80&#37; leaned towards depression. 
&#62; 70&#37; showed signs of previous trouble with the law. 
&#62; there are other catagories covered, but most fall under the 40 to 20 
&#62; percentage, so I wont show them.
&#62; 
&#62; What the outcome of this was, That Pkers, as a breed, are making up 
&#62; for serious, real life shortcomings by
&#62; acting out violent actions in a fantasy world where there is no fear 
&#62; of real life retribution. These shortcomings could
&#62; stem from anything from a death in the familly to a low self esteem. 
&#62; Some of the Pkers. however, leaned towards dangerous levels of 
&#62; instability, even to the point of needing
&#62; mental treatment. Most of the Pkers have no feelings, or are hiding 
&#62; feelings through this use of virtual killing.
&#62; It doesnt matter to them what the other people are feeling. Just that 
&#62; they feel this release from real life. If they die.. it
&#62; means nothing, they have developed a way to rebound so as to kill 
&#62; again. 
&#62; 
&#62; The Internet itself has always tended to be a haven for people with

&#62; whatever they wish because they feel safe behind the keyboard. 
&#62; 
&#62; One thing is certain, unless game makers, (blizzard, OSI, etc..) 
&#62; makes it more costly to perform PK, the
&#62; problem will just become greater. 
&#62; 
&#62; There are exeptions, however, we did meet a few people who were 
&#62; actually &#34;roleplaying&#34; the evil, highway
&#62; robber, but most of the people who were pking did it without thinking.
&#62; 
&#62; also, important to note, about 15&#37; were pking because in their 
&#62; opinion, it was the best way to get more
&#62; reagents, when asked why they needed more reagents we were told, to 
&#62; cast more spells to get more
&#62; reagents. When asked why again, we were told, because, its the only 
&#62; way to &#34;win the game&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; go figure.
&#62; 
&#62; And before you flame me, take a moment to think about it. if you 
&#62; still want to flame me, you must be a PKer who felt
&#62; this hit a little to close to home.
&#62; 
&#62; Good day
