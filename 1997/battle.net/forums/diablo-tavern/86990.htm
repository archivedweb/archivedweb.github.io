&#62; use of nicknames I can't even copy to squelch due to their incessant 
&#62; use of 
&#62; symbols.  I think if Blizzard is going to offer a chat as a way to 
&#62; hook up with 
&#62; others to play their product, then they should have the insight to 
&#62; know that 
&#62; there has to be some standards of decorum and some way of enforcing 
&#62; them.  Perhaps you all should take a look at Westwood chat for an 
&#62; example.  
&#62; My suggestion to you all is to make the chat where a channel op is 
&#62; present in 
&#62; every channel and to take some of the profits from the 13 million you 
&#62; boast 
&#62; so proudly about, and hire some system operators.  Many of my friends 
&#62; no 
&#62; longer play the game because of these unruly infantile adolescents, 
&#62; and have 
&#62; sworn off Blizzard products all together.  Since, most of these 
&#62; children can 
&#62; not afford your price for a CD, whereas my friends, and the other 
&#62; adults on 
&#62; bnet can, it seems like a bad business strategy to allow this to 
&#62; continue.

Dear, Reader

The statements made in this post were going to come from somewhere but
im glad it came now instead of later.  I have great respect for the 
&#34;legit&#34; players and hope that I my slef am one ( but alas I 
have an AAA 255 charges) but these people the &#34;Teeny Bobbers&#34; 
as they are named with the right words are using battle.net for 
anoying other players, lets take the SPAM™ for one the people that 
look at it don't care the guilds have been worn out the A#&#37; and 
no one can keep one up for longer than a couple of months then the 
players end up with a great char. with a really bad name ex. 
Spoon(SN) then after SN goes up in smoke the players a crapy name no 
one trusts because most guilds are cheating guilds.  The spam is 
worthless anoying and making every D#&N one of us mad at those little 
punks called the &#34;Teeny Bobbers&#34; and all I have said is not 
even counting the number of loop holes those hacker wana-be's found 
there has to be someone watching us those damn kids are making the 
game pointless please figure a way to get those dweebs out of 
Battle.net and let it be what it should a great FREE (the part I like 
best) and safe place to be. Thank you for your time.

From,
Lestat</pre>
