&#62;this wasn't about you.  This is just cause you are snakegod.  If 
I 
&#62;      had acted like a PK from the start, there is no way I would    
&#62;       have been 
&#62;      able to get Lep into a game later.  Oh, and he is level 40, any 
&#62;       my 
&#62;      lvl 34 mage killed him.  See, this was a game to me.  One I 
&#62;      played 
&#62;      very well.  I pked you and Lord while acting nice, which later 
&#62;      allowed me to get Lep into a game to get another prize.

You're bragging about killing Lepthana? With your lil ol mage? Know 
something Tracy, 'I' could kill Lepthana if he thought I was playing 
co-op. So could Lord Judicator, so could about anyone else. You don't 
expect your 'trusted' partner to attack you, so you figure he's 
shooting at something else, until you crumple. That's what I thought 
when I came down the steps to Faust's fireballs a few nights ago. Do 
you think you could've beat Lept in a duel? Maybe. Could you have 
beaten me in a duel? Probably. Jud? Definitely. I'm not talking about 
how you have 3 shiny new ears now, Tracy, you're missing the point. 
I'm talking about honor, respect, and all that crap. I've seen your 
clan page (no rules for diablo, but no cheats!) but still. Wouldnt 
you have been prouder of those ears if you had dueled me and won, 
dueled Jud and won, dueled Lept and won? I can't figure out why 
you're so happy about those ears, even Lept's. They don't prove 
anything, except that you're deceitful, and a very good liar. Oh, and 
kudos to you on being able to manipulate good-hearted people. Think 
about that a little, before posting another longwinded post that 
doesn't really mean anything.

P.S. I'm not going to argue anymore about my 'duped' items, because 
neither one of us will win, and because I'm already much more 
trustworthy. Think what you want, readers.</pre>
