&#62; &#62; BUT, due to the fact that &#34;There is no honor among thieves&#34;, 
&#62; &#62; you will see a constant turnover in the &#34;membership&#34; as the 
&#62; &#62; political backstabbing and BS goes on.  It is inevitable, just look 
&#62; &#62; at the history of the &#34;federation&#34;.  This group doesn't 
&#62; &#62; attract the type of person who wants to play nice with the other 
&#62; &#62; children, so of course they won't be able to get along for any 
&#62; &#62; extended period of time.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; There ya go trying to play psychologist again...

Actually I have a degree in psychology, but you are right... I am 
just playing around with it here.  I love watching the interactions 
on this message board.

&#62; I have been INFERNO for over 3 months. I have never had a personal
&#62; conflict with anyone in INFERNO. Sure, some people bug me, but thats 
&#62; no reason to start raising all hell and quitting. As far as the 
&#62; &#34;political backstabbing&#34;, in any group as large as INFERNO, 
&#62; there are always a number of people who want control. I personally 
&#62; dont, but I can understand the inclination. 

I totally agree, and you're taking some of my statements too 
personally.  I'm looking at this from a &#34;group dynamics&#34; 
standpoint, and just making observations.  

&#62; As for your initial comment about using INFERNO to puff my ego, the
&#62; same could be said about those who attack us. I personally am in
&#62; it for the fun, and fellowship. 
&#62; 

Now, I admit that I was generalizing here... but you should admit 
that a lot (if not most) of the &#34;new&#34; Inferno members are not 
exactly elite Pkers.  They're coming in, or trying to join because 
they think Inferno is cool.  I'm not debating about whether Inferno 
is cool or not.. :)  I'm glad you enjoy the company you frequent.

&#62; It must be very comfortable for you to just sit on the sidelines and 
&#62; judge everyone.
&#62; 
&#62; Silencer (INFERNO)


Gee, I didn't realize I was judging anyone.  I'm just making 
observations and stating my humble opinions.  I regret that you are 
taking them as personal affronts.  Unfortunately, I enjoy observing 
you all too much to stop, so I'll try to be more careful not to 
bruise any Inferno egos in the future.
