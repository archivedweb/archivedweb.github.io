&#62; I'm very dissapointed in y'all.  I decide to leave our Federation and 
&#62; u call me names?  I &#34;WAS&#34; as in past tense, a cheater.  I 
&#62; didn't know the meaning of legit and i never learned my lesson until 
&#62; morte set me straight.  I now have a legit character and noone needs 
&#62; to call me a cheater.  I quit inferno because u guys feel that im a 
&#62; &#34;15 yr old&#34; who doesnt know anything.  I'm not power crazed,

We always take our members seriously, and listen to what they have to 
 say.  I wonder if you understand the complications it takes in 
setting this all up.  You will find out sooner or later.  You lacked 
patience.  You basically gave up.  We are not disorganized, and 
again, you will see soon enough how much time we have put into this.  
We  don't want people in who don't understand this.  We don't want 
people who quit when things get tough.  We only want dedicated 
people.  I guess you were not dedicated enough.  This is ok, it is 
sad, but ok.

 
&#62; (well maybe just a little) and u guys shouldnt be mad at me for 
&#62; wanting to lead.  I was sick of the Inferno vs. Inferno bickering 


We are not mad at you for wanting a shot at leadership.  At this time 
we are not forming any more units until the beta comes out.

&#62; that constantly takes place.  U continually say how there is no need 
&#62; to plan for a game that is not coming out for months yet u still are 
&#62; making plans.  I'm very surprised that u would immediatly declare 

We are not really making plans.  We are running ideas around, and 
anyone can participate.  The bickering has been ended by Fist and I, 
and we have zero tolerance for it anymore.

war 
&#62; on a Clan of one of your former loyal members just because their 
&#62; leader believes ur dissorganized.  I for one am looking for a clan


No, he just doesn't think we are disorganized.  He thinks we suck and 
we lie.  Well, you guys will find out soon enough.  We  may not 
really wage war, but if  anyone wants to kill them because they said 
we suck, it is fine with me.

 
&#62; that will respect me not talk sh*t behind their members backs.  I'm 
&#62; sorry if some of u are hurt that i would like to move on, i thought 
u 
&#62; guys would understand.
