<pre>Tired of reading these posts and not having a mental picture of what 
this crazed mage looks like?  Do you actually HAVE a mental picture 
of what you think Discordia looks like and wish everyone else would 
accept it as the One True Image?

Well, NOW YOU CAN!

Today I am inaugurating the Pic of Discordia contest!  Submit your 
pics to me at ksonnier@netxpress.com and the winner will be used on 
my web site:
<a href="http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/">http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/</a> as the official pic of my Diablo 
avatar, Discordia.  Both GIF and JPEG files will be accepted, but no 
animated GIFs.

So turn that creative talent loose!  I will be the sole judge, and 
pretty impartial since I actually can't think of a good image for 
Discordia (if I could, would I be doing this?).

To the winner goes the notoriety of getting a pic on my site:
<a href="http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/">http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/</a> and credit listed there (I always 
shamelessly plug my supporters as well as myself), and also the 
feeling of a job well done.  Oh, you want more?  Well, I'll think of 
something eventually, I guess.  Maybe even a contest to decide the 
reward for winning the Pic of Discordia contest!  Yeah!

Or maybe not....

And in case I didn't mention it, check out my site at:
<a href="http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/">http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/</a>  It has links to just about every 
other Snakegod web site, so I guess this is an indirect plug for them 
too!  And I even used frames correctly so they don't carry over to 
the other sites when you use the links.  Awww, isn't Discordia so 
kind and considerate?  What a guy!  I think I'll go to his site right 
now and check it out....

At <a href="http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/">http://www.netxpress.com/~ksonnier/</a> !!!!!!!

Note that I don't have ANY images on the site that are actually there 
except for the bar under the page titles.  I'm still working on 
creating/finding them, so any assistance on those would also be 
appreciated (and I always go in for that mutual gratification thing, 
so I'll return the favor in whatever way I can).

PS - Order today your copy of How To Shamelessly Plug A Web Site, 
from Queen Salmissra.  Soon available at a bookstore near you for a 
mere $4.95, though I got a hold of an advance copy :)</pre>
