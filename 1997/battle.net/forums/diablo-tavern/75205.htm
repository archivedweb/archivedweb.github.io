<pre>  Hello Ishap....
  I would like to take this post to ask Ishap some questions and 
clarify a few points.

 1st:    I hope this is the LAST time I have to explain this to you   
         morons...The Order of the Lost is an Anti-PK guild. We kill  
         PKers. If you think that makes us PKers, fine. You are all   
         entitled to your opinions, lame as they may be.

  - Well Ish, I will be the last time. Lets see now...&#34;OL is an 
anti-pk guild&#34; yet &#34;We kill Pkers&#34;.hmmmm
    Well that does make you a PKer. You see, you said &#34;we&#34; 
meaning your guild....&#34;kill&#34;..to end life(dictionary..u know 
the big book you pointed out in an earlier 
post)...&#34;PKers&#34;..those would be players who kill other 
players..just like your guild. This is not a lame oppinion. It's just 
simple fact. PLAYER KILLER(PK) is anyone who kills another player. 
SIMPLE. Read it again if you are having problems.

2nd:  But if you PK innocents and newbies,  you are a target.

  -Define innocents. Is it anyone who is not a pk? is it kids under 
12?can you cheat and be one? What exactly is the definition,for your 
guild, of innocents? Newbies will always be killed, its a fact of 
life. I don't think its nice to kill them with any character other 
than another newbie though.

3rd :    Does everyone in the Order cheat? No
         Does anyone in the Order cheat? Yes some do. What is the     
         Order's official position on cheating? Well if you are a     
         cheating PKer i will come into your game and kill you with   
         cheats. If you are a non-cheating PKer i will come into      
         your game and kill you without cheats. 
         We do NOT use cheats against non-cheaters. Simple enough     
         for ya????

        -Ok so you all don't cheat. fine. But some do and you allow   
         it..heck you encourage it.
       - How do you decide if someone is a cheating pk or not?
       - Once again, if you kill a cheating pk with cheats you become 
         a cheating pk.
         BTW what do you do? Put Godmode on and go in chopping? What  
        do you do if they have godmode? 
      -Do you think that you could kill a non-cheat pk without        
       cheats.If you can survive as a non-cheat pk in high level 
games        on Bnet now. You have to be good. I mean I would put
       my bets on  Morte or Tracy_Lords against almost anyone in a    
       fair fight. (except maybe FLUFFY_BUNNY.one tough little mage   
     there.)
      -What do you define as cheats? Are items such as KSOH and GPOW  
      cheating? these are common dupes. OR are Thinking Cap Rings and 
       the like cheating?Please Define.
      - By using and allowing cheats in your guild you DO condone     
    cheating. 

4th:  I hope you morons realize that because of your idiotic posts    
    here today we signed up around 50 new members today. I guess 
there     is no better recruiting tool than flames from opposing 
retards.     And thanks to inferno, there is no shortage of opposing 
retards. 

  -I am sure you did. 50 more godmode cheaters who now can cheat with 
   a big fat excuse. No guilt for them. They can kill and not be      
 called a Pkiller. How nice.

5th:    So if you think you can best the Order's leaders, Lord Havok, 
       Lady Mishaela,Myrik, Cool2, Erin, and I would be happy to take 
       your ears, no cheats involved.I call you out, Puzzleboy,       
       Elijah, TracyLords, Eugene, 
&#62;      fuzzy rabbit thing, bob the llama??? what the hell kind of name  
      is that? Are you some kind of mentally challenged mascot for a  
      mentally challenged guild?

     -Well that depends on how you define cheating?&#60;see above&#62;
      If you are one hundred percent legit. I would love to fry you
      with my fireball, or be fried, yup I might not win. Other wise. 
      I don't duel cheaters.
    - I would put my bets on all of them..even Sarco..over you Ishap 
      or the rest of your guild.
    - FLUFFY_BUNNY...well he is one tough cookie.
 
lastly...my name is BLZ_BOB..and I am the Llama King...long 
story..its a playful twist on Beelzebub...nothing special but atleast 
its original, not taken from a Ray Fiest novel.

    Now I took some time reply to your post with atleast some     
politeness, so please just answer the questions. Thanx.
                    -BLZ_BOB&#34;LLAMA KING&#34;
ps. &#34;Insomnia is lovely.&#34;</pre>
