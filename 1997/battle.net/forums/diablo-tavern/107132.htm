<pre>Today was particularly hard to get through. It was one of those slow, 
uninspired, you can feel each footstep as you drag your self to your 
next remedial task kinda days. 

Do we build things anymore?
do we invent things anymore?

Im so confused and out of touch with the illusion of the 
&#34;real&#34; world that sometimes I sit in awe of the madness.
Even greater is my confusion,considering that I am a college student, 
and am supposedly learning the skills I need to succeed.

When I was in kindergarden we had nap time
why?
why not now?
Doesn't it seem rational that the adults who are pulling the 9 hour 
work shifts need an hour of sleep somewhere in the mix.
Was a day of playing with blocks,drinking cookies, and learning the 
fine art of bladder control so overwhelmingly difficult, and 
overbearingly exhausting that an hour of napping was needed?
Me thinks not

On top of ever growing pile of doo-doo , I am making a half hearted 
attempt to quit smoking,down to about three a day and feeling great 
........well........ feeling something nonetheless

I am just thankful that I am not a paranoid delusional, with a 
serious Diablo addiction
&#34;You want me to go for a walk?????.....but there might be pk's 
out there!!!&#34;

That kinda thing...........

Well here are some words of advice for everyone before I call this 
post quits........

If ever life is getting overwhelming,......if all the problems you 
could imagine are coming at you at once, .........you find your self 
terrified , alone , and ever so vulnerable..............head for a 
doorway.............and deal with those problems one at a time. :)</pre>
