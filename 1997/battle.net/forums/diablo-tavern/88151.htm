&#62; Most of you may recognise at least one of my names; Wiseman. Many of 
&#62; you, of course, may not. Of course, we can forget the name thing. It 
&#62; does not really matter who I am, or indeed who any of us are. Well, 
&#62; it seems that way. Just a warning - anyone who'll be offended if this 
&#62; post isn't really about Diablo better leave now.
&#62; 
&#62; Has anyone else ever looked around them while driving through town, 
&#62; and seen all the advertising that surrounds us? Has anyone ever 
&#62; thought about how much money is spent to ensure that we buy one brand 
&#62; of soft drink over another? And how comparitively little we spend on 
&#62; education, health care and social security? How much is spent 
&#62; researching better ways to kill ourselves?
&#62; 
&#62; Why are there great and powerful empires built around things that 
&#62; really dont matter? Has anyone looked at the number of cars passing 
&#62; on the street and thought about exactly how much of the worlds 
&#62; resources are being wasted on transport? And of course, the 
&#62; multinational corporations who strive to ensure that we continue to 
&#62; do so, because it is their income at stake?
&#62; 
&#62; Am I the only person out of all the people I know that worries about 
&#62; the world and the direction the human race is heading? How can I 
&#62; presume to say it? What gives me the right to speak?
&#62; 
&#62; I feel like I am standing at the bottom of an enormous hole, and Im 
&#62; being told that the sun is shining and its a wonderful day. I step 
&#62; back and take an objective look at the world, and see that we are 
&#62; going to hell. Mankind has ceased to care about each other, and 
&#62; ceased to care about our environment. We choose to escape from our 
&#62; responsibilities by watching television, or spending endless hours 
&#62; attempting to realign electrons in our character information files, 
&#62; trying to prove our worth by attaining something that does not really 
&#62; exist.
&#62; 
&#62; People who think like this can have all their problems solved, and it 
&#62; is so easy. You can go to someone, and they will tell you that you 
&#62; dont need to worry about it - that it isnt your problem. Get some 
&#62; rest, take two of these and call me in the morning. And thatll be 
&#62; fifty dollars please.
&#62; 
&#62; I have a question though. If it isnt our problem, then whose problem 
&#62; is it?
&#62; 
&#62; I guess I am about done. Out of the billions of people in this world, 
&#62; you are one of perhaps half a dozen who have read all the way to this 
&#62; point. I suppose you are reading this because you logged on today, 
&#62; looking for a good time, searching for fun. I am sorry to have 
&#62; disappointed you.
&#62; 
&#62; You know what the funniest thing is? I am going to finish writing 
&#62; this message, and post it up here, and go home tonight, and waste 
&#62; another hour or two of my four score years on realigning electrons in 
&#62; my character file. Because while I may be concerned, society has 
&#62; taught me I can do nothing about it. Im only twenty, after all. And 
&#62; that makes me a hypocrite in your eyes, because I whine about a 
&#62; problem and then choose to ignore it - and so then, once I am safely 
&#62; classified in your mind as someone not to listen to, youll ignore it 
&#62; too, and scroll on to the next post. And well all be happy.
&#62; 
&#62; Just a thought. It wont actually achieve anything except to make me 
&#62; feel a little better, but I would appreciate it; if you read this 
&#62; entire message, and thought even for a moment about anything I have 
&#62; said - waste a post on replying. Lets see who cares.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Wiseman.


i know how you feel wiseman, not a day goes by that i dont spend at 
least a few minutes wondering about the exact same things as you 
mentioned.  i dont know what to say...
