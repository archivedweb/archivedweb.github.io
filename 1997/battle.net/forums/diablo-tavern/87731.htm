&#62;  Original Survey posted by -=/ CodeMyster /=-
&#62;   I thought it would be nice to see answers
&#62;    from regular tavern-goers and such since
&#62; cheating is a big issue in the tavern nowadays
&#62; **********************************************

Hmmm. I think some of the above questions are obvious, and yet in 
just browsing some of the replies you have gotten, I already have 
seen contradictory answers. For instance: Teleporting in town. This 
is obvious cheating to me, since YOU CAN'T DO IT without some form of 
cheat program..AND it is part of the game play itself. You are 
getting an advantage over everyone on bnet in a relative fashion in 
that you can do things faster than someone teleporting..
   Whether something can be done naturally in the course of game play 
is my general guide for whether something is cheating, with the 
exception of something such as duping, which Blizzard has said is a 
bug in the game that it would like to fix...also common sense can 
show you that duping gives a VAST advantage to those who do it..
   Now things like letting a lower level character portal into hell 
before he would otherwise be able to do so...this may be 
&#34;cheesy&#34; but I would say it is absolutely not cheating...it 
is something that can quite naturally be done in the course of the 
game and even makes perfect sense if you look at the game in its 
fantasy role..could this happen in Tristram? Of course! Same with 
giving gold, giving items to lower level players, etc.. HOWEVER: 
accepting ANY items from people you really do not know is in my mind, 
very unadvisable on bnet, because the simple fact of the matter is 
that there are so many dupes out there that you cannot be sure if 
something given to you is a dupe. 
This is especially true in the case of difficult to find unique items 
and of course the standard Ob rings of zod, etc. You have to be a 
knucklehead to think that any Ob ring of zod given to you over bnet 
is actually legit, rather than duped..
   Monster killimg, portal killing, etc. is quite simply part of the 
game. Debate its ethics (I personally, have never MK'd someone and 
taken any of the stuff dropped, and for that matter, if I did ever MK 
a legit, I would make sure he/she got his stuff back if at all 
possible...now cheaters, heheheh, u can forget it),but both are 
legitimate parts of the game...
   Using characters as storage and transferring items between 
characters...again, this to me, is obviously a legit part of the 
game.  Could it be done in the fantasy world of Tristram? Of course. 
Can it be done in the real world game without the use of external 
aids/cheats. Obviously. Again, you might call it cheesy, but every 
single person who has the game of Diablo has the ability to do this, 
and I venture to say that the VAST majority of experienced players 
do. 
I have never played single player, but my first answer to whether 
transferring a single player character to multiplayer is that it is 
cheating, at least in general...this is because, to the best of my 
understanding, the worlds of single player and multiplayer are quite 
different...there are items unique to the single player game(bringing 
these to multiplayer is blatantly cheating),etc. And of course, it 
requires going outside the intended bounds of the game to do so. If 
anyone does do it though, they should make damn sure they don't bring 
single player stuff with them (like &#34;the Butcher's cleaver, 
etc.). 
  I think changing account numbers intentionally is very weak..the 
only reason to really do so is to hide from others or to avoid chat 
bans..now, I do know that some people have had there acct numbers 
changed unitentionally because they reinstalled the game for one 
reason or another...my Triad brother Mnadrake had this happen to 
him..for some reason, whenever he crreated a dungeon, hell was always 
EXACTLY the same..and I mean exactly. Same monsters, same stuff 
dropped, and in the same places. So he deleted everything Diablo that 
he could find on his computer and reinstalled(of course his old 
characters were gone...this is before &#34;Mandrake&#34; had been 
created). Didn't fix the problem. Turned out that the date on his 
computer had somehow gotten messed up, saying year 2000 something, 
and this was what was causing the problem (don't ask me why..Blizzard 
support told him how to fix..apparently it is a common problem).
   Now some of the external programs that can be used become 
debatable..Deye? hmmm. Tough question...if used, it should only be 
used to discover obvious cheats in my opinion, not to find out 
tactical info..it is probably best NOT to use though...that ghost see 
stuff though...if that is REALLY all it does, then maybe..but 
anything used to offensively combat cheats is just responding to 
cheats with cheating..you are just becoming part of the problem..
 As SAM HAIN likes to say, &#34;If you cheat then you are 
irrelevant.&#34; If a cheat kills you, don't sweat it..they cheated 
to do it...and just remember, if dead, restart in town,don't wait to 
be resd by someone you don't know...you'll regret it if you are MK'd 
when resd.</pre>
