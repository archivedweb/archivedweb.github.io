&#62; &#62; &#62; I read about Tracy_lords's post about THEMAN.
&#62; &#62; &#62; I was disgusted.  Tracy_lords is evil (as always been).  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I'm evil but I am one of the less likely people to create some far 
&#62; &#62; out plot scheme, let alone think of one.  Personally I can care less.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I tell you some of Tracy's little plots.
&#62; &#62; &#62; You see, many people in INFERNO --HATE-- THEMAN, so if Tracy say 
&#62; &#62; &#62; THEMAN is the LEADER of INFERNO, some people will run out and JOIN 
&#62; &#62; &#62; PoC.  That is Tracy's first plot
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Uhh, we have pretty much accepted everyone we want.  We are gonna 
&#62; &#62; vote on 2 more people, and then we prolly be chilled out.  You are 
&#62; &#62; forgetting that we are invitation only, and we vote on who we want, 
&#62; &#62; with 75&#37; needed.  I'm saying that because The Man himself is the 
&#62; &#62; one running off at the mouth acting like he owns INFERNO.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Second Plot is that:
&#62; &#62; &#62; Many people in B.net are --ENEMY-- of THEMAN, so if Tracy say 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#34;THEMAN&#34; is the leader of INFERNO, bunch of us will try to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; flame INFERNO.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Hahahahhaha.  First off I think most of B.net don't know the man 
&#62; &#62; exists, and don't care.  People have always flamed INFERNO, including 
&#62; &#62; yourself.  You don't need anyones help.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Third Plot:  
&#62; &#62; &#62; I guess that Tracy want INFERNO to Fall PERMANTLY.  Tracy want to be 
&#62; &#62; &#62; a Leader of PoC, and she want to take over INFERNO at the same time. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; No, I would like to see INFERNO succeed.  Trying to get PoC to go to 
&#62; &#62; war is not the way to do it though.  Stick with destroying good.  
&#62; &#62; Also, there are no leaders of PoC, and there never will be.  We all 
&#62; &#62; have equal vote.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;  
&#62; &#62; &#60;snip entire Eugene thing&#62;
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Really, your conspiracy stuff is pretty lame.  Sounds almost like the 
&#62; &#62; man.  All we are out to do is have fun.  Later.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; TL
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Tracy, every time one of your precious Quitters of Chaos enters 
&#62; INFERNO chat, (Pyro STICKS right in my mind for this one), a couple 
&#62; INFERNO end of leaving.
&#62; 
&#62; If that continues, I may need to take &#34;action.&#34;
