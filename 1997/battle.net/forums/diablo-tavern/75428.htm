&#62; To everyone,

&#62; Please post messages to bring back The Ironman Contest. I heard it

&#62; Please bring back Ironman.

I agree! But you gotta understand that it's not easy setting it up... 
hmmm.... what do you think of this idea... what if there was like, 
&#34;Ironman Friday&#34;, where just a bunch of Ironmanists got 
together in the ironman channel on Friday nights and started 
playing... if it was to be a competition, there'd still have to be 
someone running it, but maybe we could work out a system where the 
moderator rotated, one from a different guild each week... hmm... 
just a thought. I put a lot of effort into the original one, and 
don't really feel like getting too involved with it, but I will if 
someone wants to pick up the ball and run with it on this. There 
certainly is enough interest for such a thing- my competition had 
more than 20 teams, and I understand Deemon's did too (too bad in 
both cases many of them ended up losing out to lag and server 
splits). 

Anyway, just a running thought...
