<pre>Hello all readers,

I was just thinking about all the dumb things posted here at Ogden's. 
The trash, the flaming, etc., and then this post came to mind.  I 
don't know what to categorize the below message under.  It is just 
UNDESCRIBABLY STUPID.  I nominate the precedding post as the dumbest 
post ever written on b.net.  (A special thanks to Sexy-Rogue/Talon 
for donating this.)

Read on.........
(You'll laugh, you'll cry from laughter, you'll die from laughter.)

Title: Sexy-Rogue's realtions 1.04 (patch released)


Well some people don't understand my true self...
So i tell you again.

Sexy-Rogue = no conflict with INFERNO what so ever.
Talon = Major conflict with INFERNO what so ever.

See, i have two WHOLE DIFFERENT characters...he he he..
Well, actually i don't hate INFERNO so much, I just don't like some 
people in their group.


I had no sexual relations, yet.....(that is true!)


My relations with THEMAN:
When i seen him way back in April, i seen him with billions of hits.  
Well he IS a cheat, till now.  I still dislike him, he might be one 
of b.net's worst nightmare to me.
&#60;theman&#62; Who cares about that SEX-rogue?&#34;
(  I heard that you moron!....)

My relations with Eugene, the sarco:
I seen him with back to Feb, he was cool then, but now his attitude 
suck.  I think Eugene think himself as like a god, too much self-
confident.

My relations with PegLegBoy, leader of INFERNO:
Well, he killed me several times.  I still think he cheated but who 
cares.  I just hate peggy because he cheat and kill others, and that 
is it.

My relations with Flux-Babe, the cool:
Ahhhh.!!!  Well actually i seen her like thousand of times, she is 
still power mad woman...he he he..  She is nice, almost (98&#37;).
But do not underestimate her darkside........

My relations with SnowRabit, EasterBunny:
Well, i happen to know this fella in INFERNO channel.  This guy's 
name was originated from Easter Bunny...Well, i think he is still 
okey to eat.  Just say, I want my bunny!

My relations with Salmissra, the mighty queen:
Well, I just sort of talked with her for a few seconds, and that was 
it.  She is quite kind.. A OK.

My relations with Tarot:
Well, they are not visible anymore...where are they???

My relations with The:Godly:Soul :
Well, i just met him a few times, i can't really judge him.  But i 
think he is alright.  I don't like to offend anyone even before i 
know them.

My relations with Random:
uh...you tell me guys...

My Relations with Tracy_lords and fist:
I actually searched those two in whole of b.net, because everyone 
said those two are the best pkiller.  I met Tracy and fist, they 
don't cheat, but they are kind a wimp.  They attacked one helpless 
guy ...How courageous...  Anyway  i sort of avoid an accidents with 
those two, not because they are tough but they are cool.

My relations with mgP:
I think i met this guy before on b.net...but i can't remember...I 
just can think of mgP and that's it...Anyway i would give him some 
hands for his works on INFERNO website (need sounds...need 
sound...need sound..).
I like fellow programmers.  :)  (but i am not gay)

My relations with Students at school:
I actually beat up anyone who denies me, even girls.  I don't care if 
i were called woman beater or coward, they couldn't do a thing about 
me.  I will just punch the guy in his ass.  I treat everyone equally, 
no one's special in my eyes.
&#34; Comeon, hit me man, hit&#34;  (I actually hit him, he had some 
pain...)

My relations with my school/teachers:
I get A's, and if someone calls me &#34;Teacher's pet&#34; the guy is 
dead.  I just beat the guy until he get blood on his mouth.  Don't 
even try.
I'm kind of cooperative with teachers, obey or die....

My relations with parents:
I always (80&#37;) obey my parents...he he he..

My relations with other B.net's players:
I usually be co-op with other players, but i am always about 8-10 
squares away from them.  I'm always ready to press, &#34;phase&#34;...

(Sexy-Rogue level 30)
I'm busy buying elixirs, bye now!
