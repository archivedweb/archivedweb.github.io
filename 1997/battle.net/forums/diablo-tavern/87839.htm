<pre>To all those who are legit, I have something to say.  Do not let 
these cheating fools rid us of bnet.  Their reign is not complete, 
nor will their presence last.  I am a pk, however legit no matter 
what some people will say.  I hate cheating and I have realized that 
now is not the time to fight among oursevles, but to fight these 
cheaters.  

Some say that everyone cheats now, but many of us do not. Many of us 
who are left still carry on the fight, no matter how hopeless it 
seems sometimes.  Some of us are developing anti-cheats out of those 
twisted trainer programs.  These new weapons cancel out those stupid 
trainers and give us the edge we need. After a cheater is stripped of 
his cheats, he can no longer fight.  

Of course, they are not the main problem, the latest increase in 
cheating is due to the fact the software companies are getting into 
selling their own trainers and item editors.  Please find as many as 
you can and tell it to the people at blizzard.  This will hopefully 
reduce cheating for now.  Then we will concentrate on the individuals.

Don't give up and keep on the fight, the fight for the right to play 
diablo how it was made to be played.</pre>
