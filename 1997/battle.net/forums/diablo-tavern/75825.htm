<pre>Dear Hysteria members ...

First, I completely respect the decision made by SpiritWalker, 
acidic, and Tigerclaw to leave and set up their own shop. There comes 
a time in almost everyone's life when they dream of going into 
business for themselves. Believe me, I know it's a lot more fun 
calling the shots yourself rather than having to work in a group and 
compromise. 

However, I find very unfortunate is that you feel the need to flame 
your former guild-mates in order to get attention for yourselves. 
There is absolutely no objective reason why Hysteria and Inferno 
cannot work together, so long as the desire is there.

Second, I would advise inviting both Anu and TheMan into your ranks 
only if I had a Machiavellian bent. They both have their plusses, but 
I don’t think you want to see your new guild tear itself apart from 
within.

Third, I think it's rather sad that you have welcomed Cryptorchild 
into your ranks. This is someone who flamed Inferno and then got all 
mad when we wouldn’t let him in. Now he’s full of childish taunts 
towards Morte, who I think is one of the fairest and most reasonable 
people around. Cryptor's recent spam posts aren't doing wonders for 
you image either. You might want to reconsider these personnel 
decisions, since I’d hate for you to become known as the Inferno 
&#34;B&#34; team.

Finally, guilds come and go every day. Inferno has been around for 
months and has survived every previous prediction of its demise. You 
might want to keep that in mind before you start burning any bridges 
behind you.
