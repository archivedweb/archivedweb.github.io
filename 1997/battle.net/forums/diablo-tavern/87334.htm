<pre>  Heheheheh....That's right folks. There's a power struggle going on 
in Inferno. That is why the old TO's left. They wanted to have fun 
not play politics.

&#62; Look flux...  I was nice, I was nice to you, I was nice to PoC.  But 
&#62; you know, for a woman, you have alot of balls.  Your doing things, 
&#62; that god said you shouldnt be doing.  Flux, your so full of it, its 
&#62; flowing out of your eye sockets.  Now, I know people are gonna say, 
&#62; &#34;Hey, why is flux, saying shit like she is running Inferno?&#34;  
&#62; And frankly flux, I dont like that one bit.
&#62; 
&#62; Now...  You and pyro, met in a game, and started discussing things, 
&#62; behind the backs of the TO's.  Tisk tisk tisk, very bad girl.  Flux, 
&#62; you see.  You are the advisor, not the leader.  Lets compare and 
&#62; contrast shall we?
&#62; 
&#62; Advisor:  ADVISES the TO on whether things should be in their best 
&#62; interests.
&#62; Leader:  TELLS the TO's that it IS their best interests.
&#62; 
&#62; You arnt the leader.  And I am putting you in your place RIGHT now 
&#62; flux.  If you dont cut this _ _ _ _ out.  Start crawling to Hysteria, 
&#62; or PoC, cause if your gonna start causing dissention in the ranks.  
&#62; We dont want you in our federation.
&#62; 
&#62; It seems to me, that Sarco did basicly the same thing your doing.  Is 
&#62; that simply coincidental, or...  Never mind.  Just a thought.  Back 
&#62; to what I was saying.  Dont put your head above ours Tracy, cause Ill 
&#62; push it right back down to where it belongs.  And you know I will, 
&#62; cause there is a nova with your name on it flux.  And NO, I do not 
&#62; use that auto-kill shit, and NO I was not kicked out of Inferno for 
&#62; cheating, I quit.  BECAUSE, I didnt like the way people were treating 
&#62; my friend, and now that I have some backup in this situation, I can 
&#62; take a stand, and I can say, &#34;HEY!!  You cant do that.&#34;  Not, 
&#62; &#34;If you do that, Im quitting.&#34;  Just like Fist and Tracy did 
&#62; when they were confronted with TheMan.  Fist and Tracy said to 
&#62; PegLeg,&#34;If you let TheMan back into Inferno, WE QUIT!!&#34;  Well 
&#62; it turns out the Quitters of Chaos quit anyway.  But that is beside 
&#62; the point.  Im getting a lot of $h*t off my chest in this post, but 
&#62; the most important thing to remember flux.  Is that you are not 
&#62; leading, you are following.  You are following me, Wager, and Kharn.  
&#62; Why?  You ask.  Cause thats why god put you here flux.  To follow!
&#62;
