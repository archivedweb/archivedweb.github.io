<pre>I have KSOB on my warrior..and I didn't even found it.. how do I know 
it's not duped??? simple! t's 3-7 version!!! I saw GHOW at wirt and I 
bought several Kings swords... I bought about 3 awesome shields of 
tiger ac range from 16-20 and guess what? None of those shields were 
indestructible! I also found two Diamond rings of Zodiac on one level 
of nightmare hell.. and both of them were +20 to all.. but one was 52 
resist magic(foxglove has it) and other was 55(I kept this one for 
myself) I also found awesome plate of sorcery... and many other kewl 
things... and let me assure you.. they CAN be found... however 
OBS.Zodiac rings are too well known by stats... either old version 
+19to all or new one +20 to all +37 resist all.. same with jade 
jewelry of zodiac.. and GPOW.. which still can be found NOT 
indestructible in foreign channels.. however... Awesome shield of 
tiger and KSOwhatever except for ages may not be indestructible.. I 
duelled a snakegod member today... he obviously had a godmode at the 
beginning... Expirienced warriors know that moment when opponent 
starts to take hits... well his HP never dropped down... I accused 
him of godmode... other member of snakegod was present.. so he 
decided to test it... after about 45 seconds another member was 
finally given a full mana... and yeah.. godmode was gone.. har har 
har but now I could deliver a swing and I chased bastard all over 
dungeon taking 100 hp with each hit!!!He finally exited the game... 
when he was asked about his ac he said it was 352... now I know guy 
who uses dupes... he has GPOW and GSOA and Royal circlet... but he 
still cannot reach same ac and same hp... note.. guy I chased had 
600+hp as a warrior.... I think SG need a good clean up.. as of now I 
suspect most of members using dupes... even salmissra using obs. 
zodiac.... which she &#34;FOUND&#34; har har har.....let me find OLD 
version of obs.zodiac ring one with +19 to all and we can compare 
them.... har har har.. by the way.. in one of her posts Salmissra 
called her obs. zodiac &#34;First and only trade&#34;.... har har har 
har har</pre>
