<blockquote>
<pre>  For weeks now TheMan has been bragging about how great a dueler and 
Pk he is. If I remember correctly, in one of his posts he stated that 
he has killed over 2000 people. We all laughed at this because no one 
here has ever seen TheMan in a public or private game. The only place 
we've seen him is in chat. Several people on this forum also 
challenged him to a duel. TheMan responded by calling them cheaters 
and that he doesn't duel cheaters. Well, if you can call someone a 
cheater with absolutely no proof, you better be able to take it when 
someone does the same to you. Also, when you say you are one of the 
best pk's and duelers on Bnet, you better be damn ready to back that 
up also. TheMan has also been constantly flaming PoC. Once again, if 
you can dish it out then you better be ready to take it. TheMan is a 
deceptive manipulative coward, and oh yeah, a cheater also.  



PS. We're not questioning whether someone can legitly atttain level 
50, but whether TheMan did it legit. As you can see, most people 
don't think he did. 



&#62; Say two people both LEGITLY get to level 50, no matter how long it 
&#62; takes them to do it. Ok, now, say one guys name is The Man, and the 
&#62; other is Ske.  My question is, why do all of you indirectly attack 
&#62; The Man for no reason, when you know that level 50 IS possible?  I 
&#62; see no threats thrown at Ske (i'm using my name to explain the story 
&#62; I saw in the forums), and Ske walks away peaceful.  Yet, The Man 
&#62; gets insults and what-have-you thrown left and right.  I've read all 
&#62; of PoC's, Inferno's, and The Man's posts, and I really don't see 
&#62; what's to hate about The Man, and notice that people who don't even 
&#62; know him come to 'back up' their friends.  What causes this?  I think 
&#62; the word I'm looking for is Jealousy.  Some may disagree, but that's 
&#62; what I see here.
&#62; 
&#62; Any comments, flames, or whatever welcome.
&#62; Ske</pre>
