<pre>Well, Zamp, I considered your suggestion on that I retire this char 
if I get killed. Well, first of all, it does add more suspence to my 
game play. But, it is pretty unfair because I would be the only one 
restricted my this rule.

Cuda and I are having a little friendly rivalry, if we both put our 
character on the line, then it would get pretty nasty. I don't want 
Cuda to quit his char if I somehow managed to beat him, yet I don't 
want to quit my char just because Cuda beat me. To tell you the 
truth, I am not sure I can beat Cuda, and a smart Pk don't put 
himself on the line if the odds are too great against him. Cuda is 
reputed to be one of the best &#34;PKers&#34; on b.net, and judging 
from the posts here and what I heard, I believe it 120&#37;!

This IS a very interesting idea though. So I will tell you this, if I 
ever get Pked by legit character(s) or I died in an attempt to Pk 
legit character(s), I WILL quit this char. Hehe, hopefully this will 
make me the hunted for a while. =)  

*** Notice I said LEGIT characters ***

Well, this DOES add a little more concequence for me.. hehe. I hope 
you guys are a little bit happy. But, it's still a bit unfair for me 
to be the ONLY one being restricted. Do you(co-opers) care to join 
me? That is to say, if you ever get PKed by a legit character, you 
would quit your char? Hehe, this is purely a restriction I put on 
myself, not a challenge nor a bet, just wondering what you will do.

INFERNO + UO-INFERNO

&#34;Well Cuda, seems our showdown is comming forever closer... hehe. 
I still hope to get a few levels before the fight... by the way, what 
level are you? THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!&#34;</pre>
