<pre>K, so I started a new guy last night. Lag was really bad, 3 steps and 
it would lag. The guys name was hook hand jimmy, and I decided to 
start in Vesper. Who knows, maybe I would see BLZ. I started walking 
around the town, and this b***ch called Syria kille me. I got 
&#34;Why the hell did you do that?&#34; She goes &#34;Uhh, I wanted 
to see if I could kill someone.&#34; ******* stupid ******, she can 
***** all the way to ******* hell....
Well, I made a really bad mistake and decided to be a ghost. Why was 
this a bad idea, you ask? Cause, being the newbie I am, I have no 
idea where to get resurrected. But it does get worse...
Now, I should of gone northe of Vesper to the Shrine of Sacrifice, 
but I decided to go a little water walking. BAD IDEA.
I got hopelessly lost, and the only land I ever saw was this little 
island. I also saw a sea serpent, but I was dead so I couldn't do 
anything. Now this is where it gets REALLY bad-
I fell through the map. Yes, I fell through the map. Out in the 
middle of the ocean, half of my body was stuck in the map. Couldn't 
move anywhere, and to boot that annoying sea serpent kept popping by. 
So, I go &#34;Hey, no problem, the GM's will help me out 
(gamemasters)&#34;. So I start paging them. Half an hour later, I'm 
still stuck there, paging like crazy.
The moral to this story-  DO NOT BE A GHOST!! BAD THINGS HAPPEN!!
Then the servers went down, and I went to bed.

This morning I logged on as Hook again, and I was still there and 
GM's would not come. Screw this I said, I'm going on as Tyrael.
So, I log on as Tyrael and find myself in Britain. Britan really 
sucks, it's loser capital of Britannia. So I decided to venture 
outside the safe haven of Britain and to go to Trinsic, the cool 
walled city to the south. There I met with a guy that told me how to 
copy things to my spellbook and do some other stuff. He then took off 
for Skarae Brae while I stayed in Trinsic. I then met up with some 
guy called Ratailin or something like that and MJack. We decided to 
go and hunt for wolves or rats in the forest. MJack quickly lagged 
out, but me and whats-his-name went off. The only monster we saw was 
a sleeping reaper, and we ran off like little girls when I woke it up 
with my magic bolt. You should of seen it, when I woke it up it 
started talking to me!! It seems the Reaper and mushroom are closely 
related.
We then ventured west until we came to a mountain range. We then 
tried to look for Destard, but all we found was some Ore. That was 
good though, we could sell it later. Going further north, we heard 
someone talking. He kept saying &#34;One second has passed&#34; and 
stuff like that. We then tried to find the source and we found the 
Talking embers of Wonder. Well, it wasn't exactly called that, but 
the embers kept telling us what time it was. We then looked over to 
his buddy O Log. Not A LOG, it was called O Log. This started making 
UO look like ALice in Wonderland, so me and whats-his-name split. I 
then crashed when we came upon a wondering shopkeeper. 
That's about it so far, stay tuned for more Adventures in UO.

Take it easy,
Tyrael
I AM THE TIGER</pre>
