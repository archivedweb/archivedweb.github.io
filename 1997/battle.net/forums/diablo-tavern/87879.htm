&#62; 
&#62; Pkers suck because what they do is pointless and ruins the game, 
&#62; although LEGIT DUELING is good, beacause all players agree to kill 
&#62; eachother in fair combat, and ussually ress the guy once he's dead. 
&#62; But pkers only skitter around, the most recent one, Necare, with 
&#62; godmode senlessly ruining the game for the other players.  Their too 
&#62; chicken sh*t to even turn off their damn god mode and play a fair 
&#62; fight, and this one was too stupid to even take the ear, now i know 
&#62; pk'ing is bad enough, but when you don't take the ear!? thats just 
&#62; stupid senless crap,(he didn't even take my gold.) and whats worse, 
&#62; they just vanish off into thin air once they have eradicated all the 
&#62; other non-pk players who didn't have a chance to attempt to turn co-
&#62; op off adn fight off the little bastard as he stabs them in the back.
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, just a hint, if u don't want pkers in your game, one thing to 
&#62; do is never call your game NO PKERS or NON PKERS ONLY, that's the 
&#62; first ones they target.  And if you ever run into Necare out there, 
&#62; kill the little mf and save yourself a little agrivation.
&#62; 
&#62; And thats NECARE so you don't forget, he's a warrior, level 25, 
&#62; cheats, and would be fun to kill for revenge, I OFFER A 5000 GOLD 
&#62; REWARD FOR ANY WHO BRING HIS EAR TO ME!  REPLY HERE AND TELL ME THE 
&#62; NAME OF THE GAME YOU WISH TO MEET ME AT, WE SHALL MEET IN THE TOWN 
&#62; SQUARE WHERE THE TRANSACTION SHALL TAKE PLACE.  this offer void if I 
&#62; already kill him.</pre>
