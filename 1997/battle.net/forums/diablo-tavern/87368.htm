<pre>	To start things off I am INCREDIBLY dissapointed with this part of 
my story. I'm not even sure why I'm posting it. I have re-written 
this part more times than I care to mention. I guess it's just one of 
those times when the creative juices weren't flowing. I also found 
out that my computer is in more serious trouble than I thought so I 
think that affected my creativety some. Oh, well. Thanks to all of 
you who took a glance at my site. I have lightened the colours on it 
so those who reside at Lord Elrick's Home For The 'Experienced' 
Adventurer can now read it. I am planning on adding a guest book as 
soon as I purchase some more server space. What message would be 
complete without a shameless plug for one's site?

If you have any comments about my tale (or criticism), please feel 
free to let me know.

Part VIII

&#34;To Capture A Dragon&#34;

	The towering dragon slowly  got to his feet and glanced around at 
the rocky ledge he had crashed into. Shinnarhra was laying nearby 
unconcious. She had jumped just at the last minute before the crash. 
&#34;Stupid human&#34;, remarked the dragon. He walked over to the 
injured rogue and shook her. &#34;Hey! You! Wake up! I'm the one who 
did all the flying. If anyone should be sleeping now it's me!&#34; 
Shinnarhra's emerald eyes flashed open. The first thing she saw was a 
grinning dragon staring down at her. She screamed. &#34;Get away from 
me!!&#34;, she screamed as she drew her sword. She slowly backed up 
against the mountain side praying that some would come and rescue 
her. &#34;What do you expect to do with that?&#34;, questioned the 
dragon refering to her sword. &#34;Protect myself&#34;, Shinnarhra 
answered between excited breaths. She stared deep into the eyes of 
the dragon trying to guess what his intentions were. As she glanced 
at his left eye she suddenly felt at ease; for running down across 
his left golden eye was a deep scar. &#34;Stonehaven?!&#34;, she 
gasped laying down her sword. &#34;Very good. I was begining to 
wonder when you would catch on&#34;, Stonehaven answered with a grin, 
&#34;very few people have ever been able to calm down and think when 
they meet up with myself in my dragon form. I usually end up eating 
them!&#34; &#34;Eating...them?&#34;, said Shinnarhra rather 
horrified. &#34;Of course not!&#34;, bellowed Stonehaven, &#34;humans 
have an absolutely repulsive after taste.&#34; Shinnarhra let a weak 
smile creep across her enchanting face. She was not sure if 
Stonehaven was serious or joking.

	&#34;Aahh!&#34;, growled a grinning Cohen as he suddenly flopped 
himself onto the ledge, &#34;finally! Morteleux! Hurry up!&#34; Cohen 
watched as his friend, along with Knax who was fluttering about 
Morteleux with great excitement at seeing the dragon, slowly scale 
the mountain side. Cohen laughed to himself, &#34;wait until that 
dragon has a taste of my steel!&#34; Cohen continued to laugh, not 
realizing that only a few meters behind him the very dragon he sought 
was quietly walking up behind him. Morteluex's hands clasped the edge 
of the ledge. &#34;Here, my friend&#34;, said Cohen as he took hold 
of Morteleux's right hand and hauled him up. &#34;Ah, Cohen?&#34;, 
Morteleux said pointing nervously behind his warrior friend who still 
had not turned around. &#34;BERRAPPA!!&#34;, exclaimed Knax 
excitedly. Cohen spun around and bumped noses with the dragon. 
&#34;Good day, sir&#34;, said Stonehaven with a wicked grin. 
&#34;Morteleux now's the time to show off some of that fancy magic of 
yours!&#34;, yelled Cohen as he quicly backed away from Stonehaven 
and almost falling off the ledge. In the blink of an eye Morteluex 
sent two pale yellow balls of fire at the massive beast. Stonehaven 
used one of his wings an a sheild against the spell. Morteleux then 
sent lightning but the dragon only deflected it in the same manner. 
Cohen drew his sword and charged Stonehaven but was knocked back by 
his heavy tail. Stonehaven let out a tremendous roar which surprised 
and stunned Morteleux just long enough for Stonehaven to slam one of 
his feet down onto the sorcerer. Morteleux was not crushed. Instead 
Stonehaven had driven his talons deep into the rocky earth while 
keeping the flat of his foot raised in the shape of a dome, thus 
creating a living cage for which Morteleux could not escape. Cohen 
charged once again and almost caught Stonehaven off his guard but he 
was still too late to do anything. Before Cohen could flex another 
muscle he too was imprisoned in one of Stonehaven's improvised cages. 

	&#34;Go ahead dragon, eat me!&#34;, roared Cohen. &#34;Stonehaven 
don't!&#34;, cried Shinnarhra. &#34;Stonehaven?!&#34;, exclaimed 
Morteleux and Cohen simultaneously. &#34;I wouldn't dream of eating 
these two fine upstanding citizens. Cohen here would most likely get 
stuck in my throat what with his large bones and all, and Morteluex 
is wearing too many robes. It would be like trying to swallow a 
tapestry!&#34;, laughed Stonehaven.

	Stonehaven brought up both feet allowing Cohen and Morteleux to 
return to theirs. Knax was perched on top of Stonehaven's head 
sitting between his two massive horns like some minature king. Cohen 
bent down to pick up his sword. &#34;Stonehaven&#34;, began Morteluex 
smiling, &#34;I cannot beleive it's you! We all thought that you were 
killed by Diablo so many years ago.&#34; &#34;I was&#34;, said 
Stonehaven. &#34;Then what are you doing here?&#34;, asked Cohen who 
was pleased to see his old friend once again. &#34;I cannot say. At 
least not for now&#34;, was the dragon's short reply. &#34;Still the 
draconian of mystery!&#34;, laughed Morteleux. 

	Cohen suddenly noticed the pseudo king seated atop Stonehaven. 
&#34;I wonder why the little bugger has taken such a shine to 
you?&#34;, he wondered. Stonehaven glanced up and could see two 
little legs hanging over his brow. &#34;Gargoyles are closely related 
to dragons as well as draconians.&#34;, Stonehaven gave another short 
reply. &#34;Alright, my little friend&#34;, Stonehaven said to Knax, 
&#34;off you go.&#34; Knax glided down and took up another perch on 
Morteleux's shoulder. 

	&#34;I suppose I should introduce the two of you to my rogish friend 
here&#34;, Stonehaven said to Cohen and Morteleux as he motioned 
towards Shinnarhra, &#34;Shinnarhra these are two old friends of 
mine, Cohen and Morteleux. They were instrumental in bringing about 
the downfall of Diablo. Cohen, Morteleux, this is the beautiful 
Shinnarhra.&#34; Shinnarhra's face turned a deep crimson hue. 
&#34;Well!&#34;, continued Stonehaven, &#34;now that you are all 
aquainted I can leave you alone for a while.&#34; &#34;Where are you 
off to now?&#34;, said Shinnarhra who was still slightly nervous at 
the thought of being left alone with Morteleux and Cohen. &#34;I have 
an urgent erand that must be taken care of. I should be back well 
before the evening.&#34; With those words said Stonehaven took flight 
once more and disappeared into the distance at a fantastic rate. A 
gust of wind blew from his wings as he lifted off the ledge.

Shinnarhra and the others cleared a spot on the ground, seated 
themselves, and exchanged tales of major occurances in their lives.
