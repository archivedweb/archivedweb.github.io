<pre>I have been looking through the Battle.net and you know What I heard 
everyone is talking about Ultima Online so here is my Idea make a 
Game named &#34;Diablo the next step into hell.&#34; and you should 
have these features.

1. Make it so that you can Change your characters features. for 
example I would make my self. Black hair, Brown Eyes and a flat nose 
(thats what I look like.) and be able to pick your Skills ( 2 in the 
beginning). and What Race you wish to be, and let it make it so that 
each race has some special skills to pick from, some limits (I love 
to be elves in the AD&D game.) And more Classes and be able to make 
mixes of some Classes here are some examples (Rangers, Theifs - let 
them get two times more money than all other class, illusionists.) 

2. Take of the town junk (no I don't meen to not have town,  I want 
lots of towns cities and so on.) and battle mode is allowed in town 
its the dreams of a PK to be able to back stab some one in the back 
while he is buy some thing. and make it so there can never be cheats 
for I don't see cheating programs in Warcraft II, If it was because 
the codes then let them use codes its way better than any Hacks and 
people who uses hacks some times get there game disdroyed. and let 
there be a arena where we can place bets on people dueling for its 
cool to have duel. 

3. More than just 4 player in a game for the new Diablo II make it 
like Unlimited or 100 as a limit. and make it all one huge quest or 
you can get small quests from NPCs. and Leave the PKS they are a 
great part of the game. and We should not have 1/7 having a Arena for 
Dueling. And you can go in Inns or Camping for if you want to still 
play when you have to Log of  a game. and be able to tame animals and 
neutral Monsters. and yes more monsters a lot more!!!!!!! and if you 
are playing in one area for a long time you cna build houses or get a 
job to earn some good money and don't make easy money unless you kill 
some one that is very useful or a boss but don't make money so scarce 
that every one have to PK to live. and make it that it has ships etc. 
and a whole World to playing instead of a small town with 5 people 
living (Alot better!!!!!) and let it be that you can chop up a tree 
or a guy you just killed to sell his meat or the wood. and have it so 
we can have money bags I hate to fill my inv with money that I need 
to buy a ax with. and that if we can buy horses or similar we can let 
the horse carry things and also he can die too. We must have bows 
with limited arrows for that  it is way too unRPG like and we should 
be able to refill or a archer loaded with wood can make some by him 
self. 

4. The chat room I have a great Idea for the Chat room. we enter a 
town with rooms and at the beginning we have a place where a Blizzard 
manager is and we can buy houses for our characters. and where we can 
buy Guild Halls so we can talk (Passworded) and we can leave notes to 
each other like some one can enter as a Guest and leave a note about 
he want to join the clan. (and make it take a while to build a Guild 
house ( and let us be able to see it in work and let use be able to 
add stuff to it like a small shop or a trading station would be good. 
and the blacksmith can make a duplicate of something for a charge. 
for example 1/5 of what the price he would buy it for. and we can 
leave items specially for a player and a training place would be cool 
to train your charcater properly. 

5. and make it more like a RPG. Multiple endings would be cool and of 
course we can't forget a lot more good weapons. and instead  of a 
warrior must be a guy you can have him as a woman and a wizard gal 
will be cool. and be able to back up your character not as a cheat 
but as a part of a game. and be able to leave things in your house. 
so you don't loose them and you don't have to throw away things. and 
for the non-Pks will be able to kick Pks out after they land their 
first attack on some one. and here are some suggestions I picked up 
That I like:
A ninja that can jump out of Shadows to kill (Specially made for 
PKS.) 
Allow you to take a special part of the Boss or a Person after you 
kill him (like tooth but not the private Parts AWWWWW)
and make the attractions like this:
-Strength - Physical power
-Dexterity - Nimbleness, agility
-Constitution - Durability, health
-Intelligence - Knowledge, overall smartness
-Wisdom - Common sense, perception
-Charisma - Good looks, personality
Read <a href="http://www.Battle.net/forums/diablo-suggestions/9765.htm">http://www.Battle.net/forums/diablo-suggestions/9765.htm</a> 's post 
on the Classes.

Alot more to come post your sugestions, and cast your votes to 
Blizzard of this happening.</pre>
