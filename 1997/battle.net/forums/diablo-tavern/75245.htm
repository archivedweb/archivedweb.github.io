&#62; Greetings,
&#62; 
&#62; Follwing this post I am reposting Alignment.  The reason is simple.  
&#62; As I stated some posts back, Ordo Rosae Moriatur is a guild with a 
&#62; story and that story has a beginning, middle, and... an end.  The end 
&#62; of the first story of Ordo Rosae Moriatur is on the horizon.
&#62; 
&#62; A large number of veterans (from way back in January and February) as 
&#62; well as others have noted with a sense of concern that Diablo is 
&#62; growing old and wearing thin.  We have had a slight resurgence with 
&#62; increased story telling but it is not enough to stave off the 
&#62; inevitable.  Until the expansion or sequel, alot of us are moving on 
&#62; to either Illusia or Ultima Online.
&#62; 
&#62; I have a proposition for all of you.  A way for us to say goodbye in 
&#62; an extraordinary manner.  A way to leave our mark on B.Net and to 
&#62; show these people what this game COULD be.
&#62; 
&#62; As all of you know Ordo Rosae Moriatur is a roleplaying guild and 
&#62; roleplays online all the time.  A few have even joined us (notably 
&#62; Atropos and Lepthana).  I warned them in Character last night that 
&#62; the guilds must unite to defeat the forces of Diablo and that time is 
&#62; coming soon.
&#62; 
&#62; What I would like to do is to set up a night of a massive inter-
&#62; guild, inter-channel roleplaying session and then game.  We will 
&#62; create the last story &#34;Alignment&#34; (not as it is written but 
&#62; instead as it occurs as we create it) and then proceed into Hell/Hell 
&#62; runs for our last chance to destroy Diablo and his minions.  I have 
&#62; ideas concerning limited ressurrections and ultimately if you die, 
&#62; you die.  It's a bit harsh I know, but Ordo is going to do this and 
&#62; we would like as many interested people as possible to join us.  Now 
&#62; for the kicker.  When all is said and done, we each write the story 
&#62; from our character's point of view and post it to Ogden's, and the 
&#62; Library of the Order and Red Blaze's Tales of Tristram.  It will be 
&#62; our good-bye.  The end of our story so that the new players can then 
&#62; forge ahead with their own tales and their own way to defeat Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; If you are interested please email me.  If you are a guild master 
&#62; please tell me.  
&#62; 
&#62; So far the following have expressed an Interest:
&#62; 
&#62; Ordo Rosae Moriatur veterans
&#62; Atropos and Lepthana of Snakegod
&#62; Shannow of Tarot
&#62; 
&#62; I personally can't think of a better way to go than with an epic tale.
&#62; 
&#62; I hope you can see it.  Remember a few things, Alignment is a vision 
&#62; not fact.  It is a preview as to what the intentions are.  Not what 
&#62; the events will be.  Also, this will be occurring in a couple of 
&#62; weeks.  Be prepared to meet with me and make plans concerning how it 
&#62; will be conducted.  I will set up a special web page for this just so 
&#62; we can keep track of what is going on.
&#62; 
&#62; Take care and please contact me.
&#62; 
&#62; Lady Frylia Wintersbreath
&#62; Mistress of Ordo Rosae Moriatur
Frylia, thank you. Your doing us all a favor by getting out of here. 
When you go, half the anti-cheaters go. You're running because your 
afraid of us. Ok, leave, but we won the war.
