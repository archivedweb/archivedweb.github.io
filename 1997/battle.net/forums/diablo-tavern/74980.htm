&#62; And Snakegod??? These idiots are even confused about who they are? 
&#62; What kind of guild are they? NO ONE KNOWS...!!! Not even them. I read 
&#62; 12 posts in one hours time and they each one changed what this guild 
&#62; is about. Think about it people. Is going through puberty the best 
&#62; time to be a Guildmaster?

It's clear that you haven't been following the many posts about what 
Snakegod is lately. I realize that this could cause confusion for 
you, as every single one of them is untrue, whether it is the flat 
out lies that Nevin/Fenris has been trying to propagate or the 
facetious posts by Ridcully and others which make fun of them. You 
clearly missed the humor involved. If you would like to know what 
Snakegod is all about, I will make it very clear what Snakegod means 
to me. We are simply a group of people who like to play Diablo 
together. We are friends; we are family. Nothing more, and nothing 
less. Pubescence is not something we have a problem with at all: the 
median Snakegod is 27-31 years old. I think you confuse our humor 
with immaturity.

&#62; So what about my Guild you ask...??? Well I am the Lorekeeper for the 
&#62; Order of the Lost. We have but one simple unchanging goal... To 
&#62; destroy PKers. We do not condone cheating, but our members are free 
&#62; to use hacks and cheats in order to accomplish the Goal. I mean 
&#62; jeesh...with all the cheating PKers out there...sometimes it is a 
&#62; must. We may not be the largest guild out there...around 150 
Wait, now I am confused about your guild. You say you have a very 
simple goal, but you continue, &#34;We do not condone cheating, but 
our members are free to use hacks and cheats...&#34;. Seems to me you 
need to take a hard look at that. I mean, you're either anticheating, 
or a cheater. It's really that simple. I wouldn't deign to force my 
moral system on you, but in my opinion, cheating is far worse a crime 
than pking. Pking harms an individual; cheating harms the very fabric 
of creation in this world. Maybe you don't see it that way, but I can 
have little respect for someone who uses evil to fight a lesser evil. 

Truthfully yours,
