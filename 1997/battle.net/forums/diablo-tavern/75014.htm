&#62; &#62; &#62; Name the place and time for the duel. Like I said before I duel 
&#62; &#62; &#62; CHEATERS so I will duel you. You HACKS are no use versus my SKILL.
&#62; &#62; &#62; I will collect you ear and post it on my WEBPAGE for everyone to see.
&#62; &#62; &#62; SAM HAIN
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; P.S. You wont even get the chance to swing your KSOH with its +200 to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; hit and +255 to damage. Add to that your gnarled root ring and that 
&#62; &#62; &#62; amounts to some damage. But it wont even matter because you will be 
&#62; &#62; &#62; dead before you can use it. Oh yeah about your level 15 spells for a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; WARRIOR..MUHAHAHA..thats impossible by the way....you wont get a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; chance to use it!!!!!! Come and find what a true PKILLER can do to a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; cheating no-skilled player like yourself!!!!
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#34;Insert lameo quote here&#34;
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I use a Grandfather, by the way.  But you must know lots about KSOH :)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Hehe, you really do not offend me, Hammy.  I mean, you are just 
&#62; &#62; another Hogger/Paper Tiger/Sticky Ricky.  You CAN'T offend me, I am 
&#62; &#62; above it. :)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Listen, man I DON'T duel cheaters.  So, I can't duel you, by that 
&#62; &#62; chance. Sorry, Hammy, I have heard about the crap you pull and the 
&#62; &#62; cheats you pack.  So do me a favor, Hang Yourself.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Do not worry, Hammy, I do not hate you for this.  One can only hate 
&#62; &#62; one he respects.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Before you can name my equipment, it might be nice to know me a 
&#62; &#62; little better.  I don't cheat.  And if you think otherwise...sucks to 
&#62; &#62; be you.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Take care, Hammy, and remember...I have more clout than you ever will.
&#62; &#62; Chew on that while you are dueling a clone of me. :)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Man (UO-INFERNO)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#34;What can I say?  I am a jerk.&#34;
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; P.S.  That insert lameo quote...I see you are taking your own advice. 
&#62; &#62; Your entire post seemed lame.  Hehe, if you want to mess with me 
&#62; &#62; directly, say so.  If not, don't waste my time, cheat boy. :)
&#62; 
&#62; THEBOY ET AL,
&#62;       Looks like yer buddys are standing tall for ya....but I guess 
&#62; cheaters stay together. In response to FLUX'S post: Yes I do have 
&#62; something against THEBOY and against INFERNO. First INFERNO members 
&#62; get on the tavern and post messages against cheating and being all 
&#62; high and mighty.....but you can throw rocks at glass houses. You need 
&#62; to look at yourselves before you BLAST a cheater because yer only 
&#62; BLASTING yourself.....get the connection????? THEBOY... I want to 
&#62; duel and he can use all the hacks he wants. In response to 
&#62; LIGHTBITER'S Post....who's the child....I called THEBOY out...and if 
&#62; that pisses you off too bad.....Response to THEBOY...you responed 
&#62; just how I thought you would. You are afraid to put your HONOR on the 
&#62; line by dueling me. I don't cheat. use hacks or dupes....unlike 
&#62; yourself....DIABLO'S EYE tells alot..... So until the boys of INFERNO 
&#62; can be MEN then I guess I will still post messages that poke fun at 
&#62; INFERNO. Oh yeah FLUX I am well beyond a &#34;INFERNO SUX&#34; 
&#62; poster....I want THEBOYS ear that is it.  If my parody posts of 
&#62; INFERNO pisses you off then I guess I succeded. If THEBOY will duel I 
&#62; will quit posting funny parodies about INFERNO.......nah....its too 
&#62; easy to make you babies whine...MUHAHAHAHA
&#62; 
&#62; LAter
