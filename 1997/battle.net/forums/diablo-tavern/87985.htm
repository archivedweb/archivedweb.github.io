<pre>Greetings all Legits,
We sure had fun with Silencer yesterday. We made a public game 
(Silencer was playing as his storage character, and I was in my 
baronly form). Two guys join. The 1st one says: &#34;Send a 
portal!&#34; , and the other one's name was &#34;!!!PoopyGuy'!!!&#34; 
or something like that. So I say to the 1st one that I have already 
sent him a port. 
He says: &#34;I can't see it. Send a portal!&#34; 
So answer: &#34;My bad! See I'm on the cow level, and you cannot get 
there thru a portal. I forgot.&#34;
Silencer begins to ROTFL. The portal guy says his famous line like 3 
times, and then he laeaves. However, the poopy guy became really 
excited about that &#34;cow level&#34; thing. So he asks me how to 
get there. 
I tell him: &#34;Start with the Easternmost cow, and move 
counterclockwise clicking on each 4 times.&#34;
You should know, that at the time I had a pretty good look of the 
cowfield, as I was hiding behind the entrance to the cats. The guy 
comes over, and starts clicking on the cows, by which time Silencer 
is giving me all kinds of &#60;muted&#62; ROTFL's. Poopy guy says 
that he cannot get in, so Silencer told him that it was probably 
clockwise, not counterclockwise - meaning the sequence of milking the 
cows. Then we get into this lengthy discussion which we conclude 
saying that it probably depends on where you stand. Poopy guy still 
keeps trying. 
Then I say again: &#34;Poopy guy, you sure you are legit? See, only 
legits can get to the cow level.&#34; Should I mention that the game 
had &#34;legit only&#34; in its name?
&#34;Sure, I'm legit,&#34; says the poopy guy.
&#34;What's your armor?&#34; 
&#34;Dreamflange&#34;
&#34;What's the AC on that?&#34; asks innocently Silencer.
&#34;0&#34; says the guy.
&#34;That's not a very good armor&#34; comments Silencer.
&#34;Hmm...it may be a hack&#34; I throw in.
&#34;Wait, wait,&#34; says the poopy guy. &#34;I'll make a pure 
character, and I'll come back!&#34;
He leaves, and then comes back shortly with level 1 character. 
&#34;I still can't get in!&#34; he says with frustration building up.
&#34;Oh, my bad,&#34; I say again. &#34;See, Blizzard stores info on 
the cheaters for 30 days on their servers. So, you gonna have to put 
off cheating for a month to get to the cow level.&#34;
Poopy guy leaves the game.
&#34;I don't know where I get those ideas from,&#34; I say to 
Silencer.

Ok, so if Silencer was to write his version of the facts, he would 
probably get to say all the cool lines, and I would be stuck with 
&#34;That's not a very good armor.&#34;
But I was first, so there...
