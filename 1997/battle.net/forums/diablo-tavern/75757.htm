&#62; 
&#62; Uh, as near as I can tell, you started spouting neo-Nazist crap, and 
&#62; that's why he accused you of being a racist. I have to agree with 
&#62; Hyleyn, I thought you were pretty cool,
Heh, nobody has, or ever had, any respect for me.
 but of late you seem to be 
&#62; incredibly desparate for attention.
Not really, just woke up to the real world.
 I get attention for my posts and 
&#62; my actions, and people respect me for them. There's no need for it to 
&#62; be otherwise.
I don't get respect anyways, so why bother?
 I doubt you actually believe the things you've been 
&#62; saying, but there's no need to say them, and they are highly 
&#62; offensive and inflammatory.
Like I explained in my post about my views, I said that most of that 
stuff I said in the chat rooms was to piss you people off. Those were 
my true views in the post.
 You have a right to belive that way; you 
&#62; don't have the right to contaminate the chat rooms and this forum 
&#62; with those beliefs. Hyleyn's right: go find a Nazist newsgroup if you 
&#62; want to talk about racism, and come here when you're ready to talk 
&#62; about Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; Truthfully yours, 
&#62;

I wouldn't have even brought this to Ogden's, but like I said, Ishap 
loser had to bring it up.

And ya, I do believe that there can be only one race if we are to 
have peace on this world, no matter how it must be accomplished.
