<pre>Dateline - Tristram - July 18, 1397

Tristram was rocked today with the announcement that Tryon, through 
his wholly-owned conglomerate TryonCo, has launched a multi-million 
gold lawsuit for copyright infringement against the queen of the 
SNAKEGOD clan, SALMISSRA.

In brief, the petition to Cain reads:

From the desk of Goreblatt, Killberg, Maimstein, and Bashbaum, 
attorneys

Our client, known only as Tryon has decided that he can no longer 
stay silent about this obvious and blatent attempt to muscle in on 
the lucrative graphic humour department that he has managed to have a 
virtual lock on up till now.  To whit, that the queen of Snakegod has 
deliberately set out on a course of trying to undermine his monopoly 
by continuing to add more and more humourous pictures to her website. 
Not only that, but she has also been guilty of adding captions to 
these works (which we all know is a trademark of Tryon's award-
winning cartoons.)

While the above-mentioned humoristic attempts by SALMISSRA mostly 
consist of movie and fantasy art images there is an undeniable look-
and feel issue that must be addressed.  SALMISSRA has further 
embarked on a course of deception and deceit, trying to cover her 
tracks by issuing titles like 'Toon Master' and medals to the 
aforementioned Tryon.  All citizens of Tristram must see this for the 
smoke and mirrors that this really is.  While in public this Queen 
puts on a face of benevolent ruler, in reality she is a cold-blooded 
(snake - cold blooded...get it?) assassin who on several occasions 
has ruthlessly hunted down and killed Tryon, just for sport.  We 
intend to call notable Snakegod citizens such as Kariyafan and 
Crystallion who under oath will testify that they were eye-witnesses 
to these muggings.

In the meantime, we are asking that SALMISSRA voluntarily cease and 
desist this activity until this matter can be decided by the courts.  
In order to help us watchdog her activities we would suggest that all 
readers of this post check in regularly to her site and see if 
compliance is being honored.  The URL is:

P.S.  Dave W. - you are next!  This plagerism has to stop! (hehe)

Disclaimer:
I Tryon, hereby disavow all knowlege of these actions perported to 
being taken on my behalf.  I worship my Queen.  Far be it from me to 
ever contemplate such an act of treason.  I am sure that the Queen 
would never deliberately hunt down and kill a loyal subject like me.  
On the approximately 23 occasions that it has happened I am sure that 
I was at fault.  I just must have accidentally blundered into the 
path of the steady stream of arrows.  As as to her graphic humor, how 
could anyone think that this is an attempt to carve out a slice of my 
market.  Why, she even has an image of me!  And she gave me a 
title.....and a medal............I thought I was one of her 
favorites........
