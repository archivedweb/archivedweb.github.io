<pre>BASIC COMMANDS

Any command which takes a username can also take an account number 
instead.  For example, instead of typing &#34;/whois PatN&#34;, you 
can type &#34;/whois #952398&#34;.

/whois &#60;username&#62;
Example: /whois TwainM
Looks up some basic information on a user, including the user's 
current location and account number.  This is a great way to find 
your friends online.
Aliases for this command: /whereis

/whisper &#60;username&#62; &#60;message&#62;
Example: /whisper PatN Hi Pat!
Sends a private message to a user online regardless of which channel 
that user is in.  This is an excellent way to let your friends know 
you are online.
Aliases for this command: /w /msg

/squelch &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /squelch AlenL or /squelch #683989
Ignores any future messages from that user, effectively muting that 
user to you.
Aliases for this command: /ignore

/unsquelch &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /unsquelch AlenL or /unsquelch #683989
Allows a previously squelched user to talk to you normally.
Aliases for this command: /unignore

/join &#60;name&#62;
Examples: /join bar
Joins a different channel without having to use the channel join 
screen.
Aliases for this command: /channel

/who
Displays a list of all the users in the channel.

/users
Displays statistics about the number of users currently connected to 
Battle.net.


OPERATOR COMMANDS

Operator commands only apply to private channels.

The first person to create a private channel becomes the operator of 
that channel.  You can tell who is the operator of a channel by 
looking for the user with the gavel.  When the channel operator 
leaves, he can pass on the gavel to an heir that he designates.

/designate &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /designate AlenL or /designate #673989
Selects a person to become the channel operator when you step down, 
either by resigning or by leaving the channel.

/resign
Step down as channel operator and become a normal user again.
Aliases for this command: /rejoin

/kick &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /kick AdamM or /kick #578369
Kicks a user out of the channel.  This is best used as a warning 
since a kicked user can return at his leisure.

/ban &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /ban AdamM or /ban #578369
Kicks a user out of the channel and prevents them him returning until 
the current operator steps down or leaves the channel.  This is the 
most powerful command at an operator's disposal, so use it wisely.

/unban &#60;username&#62;
Examples: /unban AdamM or /unban #578369
Allows a banned user to return to the channel.</pre>
