<pre>As many of you know, we have been working day and night to get 
Starcraft into your hands by this Christmas. 
This has included 30 hour shifts, sleeping on our office floors, and 
living on stale pizza. The progress on Starcraft 
has been phenomenal, and it is looking like all of our efforts are 
going to be well worth it. Unfortunately, it has become 
clear to us that in order to bring you the best game possible, we are 
not going to be able to release the game before 
the end of January.

In case you don't remember, the original 1996 debut of Starcraft 
looked something like this:
<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/bigpix/oldsc.htm">http://www.blizzard.com/star/bigpix/oldsc.htm</a>
We just had a world premiere at the Wizards of the Coast Game Center 
and you can see how far it has come:

The reaction of everyone there was very positive, but we don't want 
to release Starcraft until it becomes the classic 
that we know it can be. With this extra time we will be, among other 
things, refining the play balance of the game, and 
honing the computer AI.

We read our e-mail, we watch the forums and newsgroups, and we know 
that you want this game to come out NOW. 
We also want to get the game into your hands as soon as possible, but 
we want to make sure that Starcraft is everything 
you expect from Blizzard. Starcraft is a project that has been two 
years in the making. It would be an injustice to you and 
the development team to ship the game before it is truly ready.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in Starcraft. We 
are dedicated to creating the best games in the world 
for the world's best gamers. 

The Starcraft Team</pre>
