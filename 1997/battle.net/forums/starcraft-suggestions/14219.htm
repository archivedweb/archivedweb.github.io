&#62;    Everyone! I am enlightened! From now on, I will NOT be strictly a 
&#62; Zerg player! I plan on playing ALL THREE RACES!!!!! And so, I am 
&#62; going to have a contest. The prize is... (drum roll).... NOTHING!!! 
&#62; However, you could help me, and I'll give you credit, for finding me 
&#62; a name for my Protoss army. Currently, my names are:
&#62; 
&#62; Terrans ... Primarch Aradiel Markus
&#62; Protoss ... ???
&#62; Zerg ... Hive Tyrant
&#62; 
&#62;   So, find a name (something from the Eldar culture. If you don not 
&#62; know what the Eldar are, don't bother) for my Protoss army. It's THAT 
&#62; SIMPLE!!!
&#62;   Now on to Starcraft. The game will rock. However, I have one 
&#62; complaint so far: the lack of REAL strategy! Warcraft II could only 
&#62; have so much strategy. In Warcraft II, you couldn't sneak up on an 
&#62; opponent, because he saw equally in all directions! It's like 
&#62; everything had eyes in the back of their heads, for crying out loud!
&#62;   I remember reading a post in here (albeit quite some time ago) 
&#62; stating that all units should have more sight to their front arc than 
&#62; their back. Why? Think about it! Can you see anything going on behind 
&#62; you? No! Unless you are psychic! Which, by the way, I don't think any 
&#62; of us here are psychic. So basically, make it so that strategy is 
&#62; really a strong issue in Starcraft, more so that it was is Warcraft 
&#62; II.

Well, I don't have any name for your Protoss legion, but I do have 
some response to the idea of the no-rear-sight units.

It's a good idea!

In Warcraft 2, if you noticed, the unit's didn't stand still, when 
standing still; they turned around alot. This would be a neat little 
thingy to add to the game, and would add an extra element of strategy.

Oh, and I just thought of this:
One thing I liked about Warcraft 2 (and nobody else did) was the Fog 
of War. I liked playing with it on, because it added a deeper element 
of strategy to the game. I mean, how the hell can you see those ogres 
coming through a pass three million miles from your base, when none 
of YOUR units are there? It's impossible. I can see from the 
standpoint of Red Alert, where you have GPS, but if there are no 
units in the area, you shouldn't be able to see what's going on there!
The point to all this mindless drivel is that I think that Fog of War 
should be permenant. No option to turn it off. It IS fun, once you 
get used to it, but most people just say &#34;Ohhh... I hate Fog. 
turn it off, or I'm not playing.&#34;
IT IS FUN!!! and I think it should be mandatory in Starcraft, so 
there would be more Strategy.

Gosh darn it! One more thing. About LOS (Line Of Sight): will units 
be able to see over that hill if they have a long sight range? I 
don't think so. I think that Starcraft should impliment TRUE LINE OF 
SIGHT! This would be true for shooting too, you can't shoot over a 
hill, unless you have a weapon that lobs the shell over. This would 
put the Zerg at less of a disadvantage: if there's a hill they can't 
get by, the Zerg are in deep shit. They have dick all for ranged 
attacks. But on the other hand, Protoss and Terrans could clobber 
them if this was the situation. Actually, just thinking now,  maybe 
this should be left. Then walls would add a new element to the game.</pre>
