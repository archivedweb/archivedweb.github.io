&#62; &#62; Wolftrigger's last message&link sends you all straight to the 
&#62; &#62; StarRaiders home page...without bleeding informing you first!  Twats! 
&#62; &#62;  I wish people like this would just take a long walk off a VERY short 
&#62; &#62; pier!!  I have no time for this dipshit trickery.

&#62; 
&#62; are you stupid or just blind.  the starraiders agreed with JOBE to 
&#62; just put a link to our site at the bottom of our postings.  
&#62; Woftrigger says to go to <a href="http://www.netnexus.com.">http://www.netnexus.com.</a>  he said it in the 
&#62; title.  obviously you englishmen cant read.  USAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSAUSA
&#62; hey. (SR)
&#62; join the StarRaiders.  We Don't Spam.

Listen dickhead,

For a start, don't start trying any spontaneous patronising wit with 
me because you're starting it with the wrong one!  I have no IDEA who 
JOBE is!!!  If YOU weren't too blind to read what I was referring to, 
you might have thought before you re-acted.  I wasn't talking about 
putting links to your sites..by all means do so, but when someone 
advertises &#34;Free Starcraft chat at www.netnexus.com&#34;, you 
expect to be taken to a simple chat site, not someone's bloody 
guild/clan in a vain effort to get hits!

The reason I said SR are at it AGAIN is because the first time it was 
over that bloody damn lame effort to get people to join your clan!  
You remember, when you promised people the alleged REAL release date 
of Starcraft when Blizzard hadn't decided upon one themselves?  
Anyway, they're the reasons.  Suck em and see asshole!
