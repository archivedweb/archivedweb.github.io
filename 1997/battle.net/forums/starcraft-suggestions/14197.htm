<blockquote>
<pre>      You have some really good suggestions :)  I agree, each unit 
should have a bigger reaction zone, and not just stand around if 
someone near them is battling for their life.  Still, I think that 
Warcraft 2 did a LOT better job with this then Red Alert.

  The one about the sentry spot could be hard to do at best, create 
lots of lag in multi at worst.  If the computer had to scan each unit 
against another unit, determine which is stronger, and then act, that 
would surely make the computer skip some beats, and lag the game.

   I think patrol for flying units is a good idea, since the whole 
idea of Starcraft is space travel.  This would have been an easy 
option for Warcraft II, because none of the flying units (zeppelin, 
dragon, gnomish flying machine, and gryphon rider) consumed fuel 
while in the air, and they never had to come down.  Starcraft, on the 
other hand, will probably have some set air time (1 minute for 
destroyers, 30 seconds for scouts, etc.), and then the craft would 
have to land and refuel.  This could cause some problems for 
patrolling:  If the patrol route is too long it would crash, if it 
goes mindlessly through an enemy base it would crash, and also  (if 
Blizzard decides to include mid-air collisions, and I hope they 
do[can you say &#34;kamikaze?&#34;]) then there is the possibility of 
running into one of your own planes on the same patrol route! Still, 
I am sure Blizzard could fix these mostly minor problems.


  Unit AI being smart enough to seek medical aid if needed is one of 
the points that Dark Reign makes.  But, Dark Reign took it one step 
farther, letting you manually control the attitudes (testosterone or 
fuel injected, makes no difference :) ) of your troops, by giving you 
two slider bars, labeled &#34;Tenacity&#34; and &#34;Autonomy.&#34;  
I think Tenacity has to do with the gun-ho troops, and if it is used, 
your troops will wade into the frey, and won't stop until every enemy 
(or himself) is killed.  Autonomy is the gentler side, and with this 
set, a unit will actively seek out a medic, and once healed, go back 
into battle.  Both seem cool, and Blizzard would score major points 
for having something like it.


   A bombing zone option would be pretty cool, but could cause some 
problems:  It might behave like the peon in War2, walking straight 
through an enemy camp to get gold (translation:  flying straight 
through one enemies camp just to drop one bomb on another's fort.)  
Also, it could turn out to be as useless as the parabombs in Red 
Alert:  A large cargo plane, very weak and very very slow, would inch 
towards its target (or so they said, the parabombs, weak though they 
were, seemed to hit everthing but the one silo you clicked on :) ), 
and then drop 5 parachute bombs.  THAT only happened if you were 
lucky enough to keep the stupid plane alive, and the bombs were the 
most pathetic weapons I have ever seen.....

   The rally point idea is really cool.  Maybe you had a maximum of 5 
(you could configure the number) flags (each bareing your team 
color/insignia).  You could set one of these flags down in any area 
which you had already explored.  Then, if you ever wanted to send 
troops to that area, you just selected the men, and hit the number 
that corresponds to that flag. (for example:  You have one already 
established base, and then set out to build another.  When your 
second base is well on its way, you decide to put a rally flag there. 
 Soon after that, one of your scout ships discovers the enemies 
largest base.  You put another rally flag down.  You have plenty of 
resources, and are now focusing on troop training.  All goes well, 
until you hear those tell-tale screams of &#34;we're under attack!  
They're destroying our city! I can't feel my legs!  I can't feel his 
legs either! Whatever :) &#34;  So, you immediately select a group of 
goliaths, and hit the number '1'.  The goliaths charge towards the 
second base.  Then, deciding that the time is now,you select a group 
of marines, goliaths, destroyers, etc., and hit the number '2'.  They 
all storm towards the enemies base.)  Cool!

   Another idea I have, taken from the rally flag idea, is this:  
Instead of the flags being like waypoints, they could be like 
security systems:  You have a maximum number of flags.  Each flag you 
put down emits a 10x10 (or whatever you choose, mayber it could be 
upgradable to be bigger) square of purple light, only visible by you. 
 Each flag is labeled with a number (1 through the maximum number.) 
If any enemy steps within the square, every troop that is supposed to 
'guard' that area runs for the flag, and engages the enemy.  This 
sounds kind of vague, so how about another example! OH BOY!! ::::

  Your base is situated in a very large valley, with huge mountains 
enveloping you.  There is just one way to get into your encampment, 
and that is through an opening between two mountains.  You want to 
keep your area secure, so you plant a rally flag in the opening.  The 
flag has a brightly labeled (maybe neon paint or something?) # 1 (or 
whatever number) on it.  You select the troops you want to guard the 
opening, and then, with ALL THE GUARD TROOPS SELECTED, you hit the 
number 1.  Each troop now has a small one somewhere in their picture, 
or stats or something.  NOW, whenever an enemy enters the flag area, 
the troops labeled ONE will engage them.  How 'bout it? Pretty cool, 
eh? haha :)

&#62; Please make the AI better than Warcraft2 and Red Alert.  Here are 
&#62; some things that I didn't like about the Warcraft2 AI, and how to 
&#62; change it.
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Guys wouldn't run to a battle to help out if the unit didn't get 
&#62; attacked.  You should make the units automatically attack enemy units 
&#62; that are a certain distance from your buildings.  Or if there is a 
&#62; big 
&#62; battle and the unit is close enough it should head for the battle.
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  Have something like a &#34;sentry spot.&#34;  What this would do 
&#62; is if a unit saw an enemy unit it would move close to it and attack, 
&#62; but if the enemy is stronger the unit on sentry would run back to the 
&#62; spot you selected.  This would be good for drawing enemy units to 
&#62; places more heavily defended than others.  Also if you have enough 
&#62; units on sentry they might kill the attackers before they set 
&#62; foot(tail) in your city.
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  Patrol was a good option, but this time let all of the flying 
&#62; units have it.
&#62; 
&#62; 4.  If a unit is damaged and is close enough to a repair unit or 
&#62; building, it will go get itself repaired(unless it is in the middle 
&#62; of a battle).
&#62; 
&#62; 5.  I like the idea of something like a bombing zone.  You choose and 
&#62; area with your mouse.  Then the bombing units you assign to the area 
&#62; will keep bombing it.  So if you select and area 5x5 then the bombers 
&#62; would keep droping bombs then turn around and bomb the area again.  
&#62; If you choose an area that is too big the bombers would bomb 
&#62; different portions of it each time they fly by.
&#62; 
&#62; 6.  Have a rally point.  You click on a unit and then a little flag 
&#62; will appear on him.  Then units that are close enough to see it will 
&#62; come and regroup around that unit.  Good option when you're killing 
&#62; enemy units by ganging up on single units at a time and need to get 
&#62; your guys together.
&#62; 
&#62; Most of the improvements on the AI are to make the game more 
&#62; realistic and fun.  For example, in real life I wouldn't think a 
&#62; marine would stay in one spot while is buddy 3 feet from him is being 
&#62; shot.  Also if an enemy is too strong most people would run away and 
&#62; regroup.  
&#62; 
&#62; Maybe you'd want the AI to respond to situations differently for each 
&#62; race which goes with their behaviour.  Also you don't want to over do 
&#62; the AI they it is the computer doing most of the stuff for you.
