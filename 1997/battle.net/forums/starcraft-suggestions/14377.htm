&#62;    Why does everyone want to take credit for a suggestion.  If

&#62; two or three weeks earlier.  My point is:  You're not getting paid 
&#62; for your suggestions, and I highly doubt that your name will be put 
&#62; in the credits of the game or whatever, so stop worrying about who is 
&#62; responsible for certain suggestions.  That's just what they are, 
&#62; suggestions, not inventions that you've patented or anything(though 
&#62; I'm afraid some people might patent their suggestions if they could). 
&#62;  Sorry if I sound rude, but this just bothers me a little bit.  =)

I agree, and I have posted about this before (I'm not taking credit 
for the idea, though!)

The truth of the matter is that most of these suggestions have been 
posted long ago. I posted some over 6 months ago and got told they 
were old news then.

The point of this forum isn't to take credit for ideas. It's to 
discuss them (hence the name FORUM). The forurm is a place to 
suggest, modify, and improve ideas. Many of the best threads on the 
forum were ones with actual debate and discussion.

This forum doesn't just display ideas, it helps create them. Adding 
new perspecitves to old ideas, changing things as more game 
information is released.</pre>
