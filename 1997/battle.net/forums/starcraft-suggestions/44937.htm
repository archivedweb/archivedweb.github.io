&#62; That's why Dos is way better than win95, u do everything(well, ok, 
&#62; not the really advanced stuff, but installing drivers and stuff like 
&#62; that) yourself, and if u know how to do, it will allways be done 
&#62; right, unlike when win95 does it.

     For those of us who learned how to use our computers when MS-DOS 
was the only thing available (and EGA was that new fangled thing, 
much more expensive than something nice quaint like CGA), DOS is much 
simplier than Win'95.  Installing, uninstalling, it was all very 
simple.
     Until we had to explain to our parents how to use the computer 
they bought.  Then DOS began to demonstrate one of it's fundamental 
problems -- the same problem that keeps the pro-Unix types under 
wraps.  The user interface sucks, and requires memorization skills to 
get around in.  Once you learn it, it's fine, but the learning curve 
can be steep, and one little mistake means you accidentally wipe out 
your kids programming directory, making them highly aggravated.  (No 
bitter personal experience there, no sir-ee.)  Point-and-click is so 
much easier to explain, and most anyone can handle most any software 
issue with basic knowledge of how to use a mouse, under Win'95.
     True, installing hardware is still a problem, but it's like your 
car.  Explaining how to operate one is different than explaining how 
to replace a timing belt, and for most people it's best to call a 
mechanic anyway.

&#62; Besides, Dos is WAY faster than win95.

     Well, obviously.  Let's do a Clever Anology.
    Let's say Blizzard put out a DOS Starcraft, which was to the 
normal Starcraft as DOS is to Windows.

     The good points of DOS Starcraft:
     + It loads much faster.
     + Gameplay is smooth and flawless.
     + It only requires a 286, 640k RAM and fits on a floppy disk.

     The bad points of DOS Starcraft:
     - It has no graphics.
     - All user input is through typed commands.
     - All output is in the form of a printed response to the screen.
     - It can only handle one command at a time.
 
     So yes, DOS is much faster than Windows'95.  This tends to 
happen when you reduce the user interface to straight text, provide 
no online help, have no graphics, and limit user input to a selection 
of typed commands with strict parameter requirements.
     Basically, Win'95, for all the faults it does have, is still 
vastly superior to DOS.  If nothing else, the DirectX format has 
certainly made game installation (and, I imagine, programming) a lot 
easier.  No more having to try and auto-detect your sound card or 
look up what type of graphics chip you're using.</pre>
