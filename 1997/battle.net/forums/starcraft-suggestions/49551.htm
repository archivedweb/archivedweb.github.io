&#62;      I have been keeping track of the progress and updates of 
&#62; Stracraft on Blizzard's website and the Battle.net site.  I have 
&#62; purchased and played Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo.  I enjoy them 
&#62; all and I am excited to here about the Diablo expansion pack.  
&#62; 
&#62;      My question about Starcraft is the following.  From what I have 
&#62; been reading in reviews it seems as if the Protoss and the Zerg are 
&#62; going to be the dominant forces in Starcraft.  The one thing I have 
&#62; enjoyed is the balance that each race has and does not.  In Warcraft 
&#62; II this was obvious.  It seems as if the Terrans are just cannon 
&#62; fodder for the Protoss and Zerg.  I think every race should have it's 
&#62; strengths and weaknessess but they should not be obvious and easy to 
&#62; identify.  This has always been the mix for a great game.  
&#62; 
&#62;      My concern is that one race will be vastly superior over the 
&#62; others and the game won't be that challenging or fun to play.  I look 
&#62; forward to purchasing and playing game.  I have a LAN at home with 6 
&#62; PCs.  My concern and Blizzard's to I would hope is to find a balance 
&#62; between all the races, each with it's unique strength, weaknessess, 
&#62; and benefits.  So if your multi-player gaming on your home LAN, via 
&#62; modem, or the battlenet you can pick any race and still have a 
&#62; fighting chance.  Where the main factors that determine if you win or 
&#62; lose is how you setup your base, manage and deploy your units, and 
&#62; your overall stragedy.
&#62; 
&#62;      I by no way mean to criticize the programmers efforts.  I know 
&#62; the hours they put in are long and hard.  High-tech industries are 
&#62; like that.  I am currently working on a project to implement cable 
&#62; modem technologies in the Seattle, WA area.  I just hope that 
&#62; Starcraft is everything if claims to be and hopefully alot more.
&#62; 
  
&#62;                                              Sincerely,
                                                                    
&#62;                                                        Jeff Burleigh

We are going to strive to make sure that every race will be able to 
stand on its own two legs (or multiple appendages, for the Zerg) in 
multiplayer games against each other. This doesn't mean that the 
races will all play the same, however. They all will have their 
strengths and weaknesses for players to find (and exploit).
