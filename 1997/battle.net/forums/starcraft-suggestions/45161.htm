<pre>I think it would be interesting if you could capture enemy units. 
Maybe if they were weak, you could have a small cjance to capture and 
not kill them. Then you might be able to use thier weapons, or get 
information by torture. You could hold them in a small prison camp. 
You could even put up a ranson on very important guys. This was 
awfully hard to do in war. 2. Everytime i tried this i killed what i 
wanted to capture. I think it would really add to the game if their 
were these hostages. Maybe if there was enough of them in one prison 
they could even break out in an angry mob. This really adds to the 
game with hostages I think. It would really tick poeple off, and 
would be fun to do.       Tell me what you think of the idea! You 
hate it? TELL ME! You love it? TELL ME!

THanx for your time, i greatly appretiate it.
