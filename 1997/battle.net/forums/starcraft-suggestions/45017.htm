&#62;    I'm pretty sure Blizzard literally didn't trash the old Starcraft 
&#62; (the one with the Warcraft II engine). So how about if Blizzard 
&#62; releases the old Starcraft to the public for download? The game was 
&#62; pretty much ready for release, was it not? It will help pass the time 
&#62; waiting for the new and improved Starcraft. 
&#62; 
&#62; It doesn't have to be the full game, maybe a small version with no 
&#62; story nor cutscenes (if there ever was any) even if it is bug 
&#62; invested, it doesn't matter, just don't take any responsibility for 
&#62; any problems the game may cause Blizzard. You could just tag along a 
&#62; little text file explaining the controls and people will be 
&#62; satisfied. It will definetly keep people occupied for about a month 
&#62; if not more.
&#62; 
&#62; But if this takes too much time out of your time Blizzard, then just 
&#62; forget about it and maybe release a copy of the old Starcraft along 
&#62; with the new Starcraft on the same CD (if space is available).
&#62; 
&#62; It be very cool to see what the old Starcraft would have been like if 
&#62; it was actually released in '96! 
&#62; 
&#62; What do you think?
&#62; 
&#62;  
I think that would be really cool to see the E3 96 StarCraft, so how 
bout it blizzard? While i'm asking you for unreleased stuff, how 
about those War2 smackers you never used?</pre>
