&#62; I agree here, go watch brave heart or something, its a kick
&#62; ass movie :)
&#62; 
&#62; actually, no, but i think that the orcs where more resemblant of the
&#62; vikings &#60;yep this is a major stretch&#62;.  Orcs fit the story 
&#62; line better
&#62; though ;)...
&#62; 
&#62; I dont recall elephants ever being used in warfare, and does it seem
&#62; strange to anyone else that they could build fishing boats before they
&#62; learned to use tools, hehehe....
&#62; 
&#62;&#62; i believe they also get an archer range bonus or 
something.  The
&#62; problem here is, although they have bonuses, they do have the same
&#62; units, which does fit in with historical sim.  But i find fantasy
&#62; funner.
&#62; 
&#62; I aint gonna touch this one.  How bout we just call all rts's
&#62; dune 2 clones :)
&#62; 
&#62;&#62; It is funner to play against real people, i rarely ever 
play computers
&#62; in any game that has multiple players.
&#62; 
&#62;&#62; The limit is not exactly reasonable, i can easily build 50 
villagers
&#62; i hate having to kill things off just so i can build more useful
&#62; units.  Have you ever read up on some of the armies in this game
&#62; they wheren't by any means small, some thousands large... just
&#62; thought i'd bring that up
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; I played early versions of netstorm, its wasnt too bad, except that
&#62; it becomes unbalanced huge if you fight against people with a higher
&#62; rating then you.
&#62; 
&#62;  
&#62; brats, hmmmmm, rapid mouse clicking?  i cant believe how many people
&#62; say war2 was a click fest.  If you ever used humans, you had to
&#62; use all the units, decide when and where to hit, use the spells
&#62; and other such &#34;clickings&#34;. And despite what you all might 
&#62; think,
&#62; AOE is just as much of a click fest as any other game.  if your going
&#62; for non-click^fest, dont play &#34;real time&#34; strategy games, play
&#62; turn based, now thats true strategy...
&#62; 
&#62; Index
&#62; - this is getting addictive &#60;replying to aoe cultists&#62; :)

Eh, some of the things mentioned was quite.. fuzzy.  First of all 
Elephants archers and calvary were first deployed against Alexander 
the Great by the Persians.  This would fit into this time period very 
well.  The Indians had a quite large amount of War elephants as part 
of their standing army as well during roughly 500-1600 A.D.  The 
earliest account of fishing boat were no larger the canoes used by 
Eskimos, Eastern Asian civilizations as well as the Vikings and 
Normans.  Tool age is irrelevent considering all you need is a stone 
axe to carve wood.  On the unit limit issue, you don't have to always 
kill units.  On units like calvary and horse archers(which in my 
opinion is probably the most effective unit in the game) if you 
research a tech, it'll upgrade all of them instantly.  Plus, if you 
hit the unit limit, mount an assault considering rebuilding in this 
game is relatively quick if you have adaquete defense.  Besides.. 
building a large number of peon force is hardly a smart strategic 
move 
unless you're planning a Jihad or something.  Click fests are fun, 
they test your reaction skills as well as you thinking abilities 
under pressure.  The best players knows how to combine these two 
effectively and proficiently.  I do agree playing against human 
opponents is much more fun.  The computer will never have the same 
prowess as a human when it comes to the most effective 
countermeasures 
against the opponents strategy.  Btw, Dune 2 still rocks, I still 
play that once in a while actually.  It was the first real RTS out 
and too bad it never got round to having modem support.  

P.S: using humans in War2 is a bad example for click fest, cuz no 
matter how fast you click, they still die in droves.  They simply 
blew chunks.</pre>
