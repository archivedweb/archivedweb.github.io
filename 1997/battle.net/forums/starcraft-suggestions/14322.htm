&#62; &#62; &#62; I hope there is the passage of night and day in this game.  Also,

&#62; &#62; This is a good idea. If it snowed it would be harder to control your 
&#62; &#62; wheel based units. If it were cold your Zergs would have to have a 
&#62; &#62; heat source come with them in their inventory. If it were hot the 
&#62; &#62; Terran would over-heat, Zergs would de-hydrate, and I don't realy 
&#62; &#62; like those other guys sou i just won't say anything about them. If it 
&#62; &#62; were rainy (sulfer should be included) the metal units should rust 
&#62; &#62; unless they were kept dry. And people (like the maraduers) should 
&#62; &#62; have different cloths (ie rain coats, tunics, ect.) for the different 
&#62; &#62; weather patterns. This would be cool.
&#62; 
&#62; Um if maraduers wore tunics, wouldn't the vacuum of space rip apart 
&#62; their guts? This would be a COOL idea for Warcraft III, if there is 
&#62; such a thing!
Yes the vacume of space would rip them apart but i was refering to 
planet surfaces when it snowed. And it would be over their space 
suits anyway. (Is there snow in space???)
