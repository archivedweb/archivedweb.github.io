<pre>Everywhere I look it is someone asking when SC Beta will come out, 
guild recruitment, and now its the MAC/PC debate again.  What is with 
you people?  I will address these issues one at a time...

SC Beta.. Blizzard already addressed the issue stating &#34;We do not 
have any info on the SC beta, when the SC Beta is available, you will 
see it posted on our website &#34;<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">http://www.blizzard.com/</a>&#34;&#34;

Guild recruitment..  Guild recruitment is ok, but after a while, its 
annoying, like if there are about 10 posts for the same guild in a 
row, that is going a little overboard, but thats not for me to judge, 
just saying it is a little much.

MAC vs PC Debate.. Ok, MAC is good at some things while PC are good 
at others, the reason I use a PC is because all of the cool games 
usually come out for PC before MAC and because of the fact that if I 
used a MAC, I wouldn't be compatible with school since they use PCs.  
PCs ARE frustrating to use but so are MACs at times, if anyone gets 
to say how crappy PCs are, it should be ME because I have had the 
most friggin trouble in the past few months than I have EVER had with 
my PC, but that is just a Microsnot problem, which may end up in 
court, but that is not the issue, the issue is that MACs are not much 
different than PCs, sure they can be easy to use, but they can be 
hard to use, there is no real reason to start an argument over which 
is better.. its like two people fighting over who's girlfriend is 
hotter, or who's car is faster, it doesn't really matter in the end.

CLU of Snakegod
EX-Diablo Player, which reminds me.. PATN,  can you send me that info 
on advertising and other misc stuff that I wanted, my email is above 
with a little trick I use for forums, some people have little bots 
that get your email off of forums and it doesnt EDIT your email when 
it sends stuff so if it sends to 
clulesswonder@*REMOVE_TO_MAIL*hotmail.com it will go NOWHERE :)   So, 
as you probably guessed, you should &#34;remove to mail&#34; :)</pre>
