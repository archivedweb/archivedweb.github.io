&#62; Um I am just wondering if the units will be bitmaped or true 3D 
&#62; rendered because form the screen shots it dosen't look like it.  This 
&#62; , I think, would be a great improvment if you don't already have it, 
&#62; the 3D rendered that is.  I would gladly wait until next year to have 
&#62; this done and maby some others I will mention later.  I think you 
&#62; should have multiple units (like Atleast 30) for each race.  I know 
&#62; this is hard but I found in TA (Total Annihalation, i think that how 
&#62; you spell it) that with 75 different unit to build it gave it more a 
&#62; stratigic feel and also made it funner, I thought.  Also 3D terrain 
&#62; adds more of realizm to the game and i know this is hard and takes 
&#62; time but, hey i can wait, I hope ;).  Water units are also cool and 
&#62; adds more units and stragety to the game.  Right now it looks like a 
&#62; pretty awsome game and i would like it definatly and play it a lot 
&#62; but there are some of those things that would make it even better so 
&#62; that is would be the ultimate stragety game ever, like the things i 
&#62; have mentioned above:).  Well I think that it for now and Comments 
&#62; form everyone, especially Blizzard, of course.  More to come probably 
&#62; as I think of them :).

In my opinion graphics are highly over rated.  Good graphics and 3D 
images are not required to make a good game.  In fact in some cases 
good graphics have made the game worst.  Ultima8 comes to mind.

Lots of different units sounds like a great idea, but as mentioned 
many times before on this forum, how do you keep track of the stats 
of that many units.  With lots of unit comes the problem of making 
them all unique.  How can you possible make that 75 units per race 
unique.  It sounds like a great idea, but it wouldn't work.
