<pre>Hey all...

I noticed something.  Blizzard has recently put a lot of effort 
behind Lord of the Clans, pushing it hard on their web page and such. 
 They have also said nothing about Starcraft recently-- their entire 
web page is now devoted to LOTC.  It seems to me that Blizzard is 
putting all their effort behind LOTC (especially since their web page 
says that it will be out by the holidays) and doing less with 
Starcraft.  Now I don't know a hell of a lot about game development, 
so if I seem ignorant, I am-- please help me.  However, I didn't 
think that it would be possible to put out two games of Blizzard 
quality within 3 or 4 months of each other.  Is this possible?  Or is 
Blizzard screwing over Starcraft?

Please keep in mind that these are only my thoughts... in random 
order ;-).  It is not my intention to insult, scare, or otherwise 
play with people's minds.  Please post all your thoughts, but email 
me them too-- I recently had to switch from an Ethernet connection to 
a 14.4k modem, and it's culture shock.  I can't check this forum at 
all hours anymore ;-(.  Thanks in advance.  Later...
