&#62;    I still like the idea about naming your units when they get out.
&#62; Imagine: [vulture is produced]
&#62;          [click on it]
&#62;          [on the bar it has a button called &#34;rename&#34;]
&#62;          [you click on that]
&#62;          [it says &#34;new name:________&#34;]
&#62;          [you type in something like &#34;Cho'gall&#34; or something]
&#62;   Want to find that unit? press &#34;enter&#34; and type 
&#62; find/Cho'gall.
&#62;   It wouldnt send it to the other players, but it would  
&#62;   not neccesarily center the view on it though. If you wanted
&#62;   to see it you could click on its picture in the bottom bar
&#62;   like in war2.
&#62;  
&#62;     See, if you had a unit with a lot of kills(assuming kills help
&#62;   the unit out weapons wise or something), and you wanted it
&#62;   without having to look around for it, you just type in what I said
&#62;   above and there you go. Or it is a veteran unit and that counts
&#62;   as something(interesting upgrade- veteran units get weapons +4 or
&#62;   something) could be found easily.
&#62;     I dont know if any of this could help or not, but how could it
&#62;   hurt? I think it would be funny to click on a zerg queen and it says
&#62;   &#34;Big Mama&#34;. hehe.
&#62;     And that thing about having certain units throughout a # of games
&#62;   or whatever, for each game you could have a list of optional names
&#62;   of previous units that have high rankings on them that could be your
&#62;   only unit. So you and a couple other people could play a little game
&#62;   of &#34;sole surviver&#34;, not. j/k. I guess that unit could 
&#62; represent you
&#62;   and that the more experience the unit has, the more points you get
&#62;   a game( haha like the programmers could implement this into the game
&#62;   at this time).
&#62;      Well, that's it for now. I'll most definately be posting more 
&#62;   stuff up untill the beta sign-ups come out.

The only naming suggestion that would actually ADD to gameplay.
I think this is a good idea and I think the &#34;Auto name&#34; with 
a editable text file is cool too saving time and you can still have 
name jokes to keep the enemy laughing while you kick the shit out of 
him when his hands leave the Keyboard. (I'd immage there would be 
hundreds of those &#34;Simpson Prank Call&#34; ones Like &#34;Iye P. 
Freely&#34; or &#34;B. O. Problem&#34;.  Frankly I'll make a ton of 
heros if I can't name them.</pre>
