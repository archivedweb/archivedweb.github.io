&#62; &#62; &#62; Im serious.  The last 6 messages from Blizzard have been &#34;We have 
&#62; &#62; &#62; not released a date for the beta or the release date.&#34;  No 
&#62; &#62; &#62; comments on the game.  Face it folks.  Their going to shift 
&#62; &#62; &#62; EVERYTHING into Lord of the Clans, like they did with Diablo.  Diablo 
&#62; &#62; &#62; is no fun!!!  Theirs too much cheating.  Blizzard has done best in 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the RTS field, and that is where they should stay.  Are you waiting 
&#62; &#62; &#62; to unveil Starcraft's revolutionary what-chamathinge at a convention 
&#62; &#62; &#62; or something?
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Hunter
&#62; &#62; You are right about the releases, but the reason they shifted 
&#62; &#62; everything to Diablo is because it was supposed to be their next game 
&#62; &#62; and it was.  Also, there is no way to prevent cheating the way Diablo 
&#62; &#62; was set up to run, hackers will always be a step ahead.  First of 
&#62; &#62; all, hackers do not have to worry about their program crashing 
&#62; &#62; peoples' machines and they also do not have to make it small enough 
&#62; &#62; to be released to thousands of people at a time.  Diablo is fun, I 
&#62; &#62; played too much so not anymore for me, if you have someone to play 
&#62; &#62; with who doesnt cheat, just find people who are usually on the same 
&#62; &#62; time as you.  
&#62; &#62; Oh yeah, and Blizzard is revealing much of Starcraft at E3.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Vossman[DN]
&#62;      When is E3, Vossman?



If you want to see the date that this year's E3 (Electronic 
Entertainment Expo) will be, look at www.e3.net, it also tells you 
what other companies will be there, and what they'll be showing (by 
the way, Starcraft and Dark Reign will steal the show). </pre>
