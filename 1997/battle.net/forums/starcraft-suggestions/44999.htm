&#62; The thing is I want the game in my hand in Korea as soon as it's 
&#62; released in U.S. You might be thinking, &#34;Hell, those stinking 
&#62; Kimchi Koreans can have the game when I want to sell 'em there.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; That's a big failure in marketing strategy for many game makers in 
&#62; U.S. Hey, Koreans DO play games, and DO buy games if they are worth 
&#62; money. Even though 9 out of 10 people play pirate copy just to screw 
&#62; up bliz, that number can be significantly reduced if bliz would give 
&#62; us opportunity to own a fancy paper box and shinny vinyl wrap by 
&#62; purchasing a legal copy. Not many gamers have patience, and would not 
&#62; wait till bliz release the game in Korea with a Korean manual. And 
&#62; they wouldn't fly over to U.S. just to purchase a game. They would 
&#62; probably get the first copy of pirate CD. You can easily quadruple 
&#62; profit at bliz if you do what I tell you to do.
&#62; 
&#62; Bye~


Hey thats a good idea. And after you put blizzard under your hypnotic 
trance, so they do what you tell them to do, tell them to send me a 
free copy of the game ok :) Oh yeah and tell them that if they have 
any extra money (because you are going to make so much for them) tell 
them to give some of it to me. You know that extra money that they 
were just gonna throw away because they didn't need it. While 
Blizzard is Hypnotised, make them cluck like a chicken or sing elvis 
or something. That would be great!
