<pre>I saw this one too... It is true that the AIs would be different in 
strength. But like I posted before, you can pit the different 
computers against each other, and figure out WHY one won and the 
other didn't. Was it the AI fault? Was it unit unbalances? Was it 
another factor? etc... Blizzard can watch with fog of war off, on 
different computers, step by step what is happening. I'm not saying 
that by doing this all their balancing issues would be solve. Just 
saying that this would give them some insight to what they might need 
to do and what they might not have to do. Maybe they'll need to tweek 
one of the AIs or change the strength of a unit or change something 
else. This does solve the problem of having to be the player and the 
one to figure out what happen... Watching the computers fight, would 
give you more concentration power on what is happening and why.

&#62; The AI's have to be programmed in differently depending on the race 
&#62; (zerg would not work well if you played them like protoss)
&#62; therefore the races may be balanced but the AI's might not be.  I 
&#62; personally think the AI for zerg would be vastly superior to an AI 
&#62; programmed for the terrans (think about it, it is easy to make the 
&#62; computer create large forces and manage reasources, yet very 
&#62; difficult to have it know when to move it's base, who to pick off 
&#62; with ghosts, etc.)  Therefore since the AI's are not going to be 
&#62; equal, a fight between two computers will not be equal even if the 
&#62; races are balanced for a human(as in player, not race) game.

&#62; &#62; &#62; I was reading one of recent posts dealing with balanced sides. One of 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the replies pointed out that, it is a common mistake that most 
&#62; &#62; &#62; players see someone winning because of the race they choose and not 
&#62; &#62; &#62; because of their skill level. This has happen a lot in Warcraft 2, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; were bloodlusted ogres are viewed as the winning team.  However it 
&#62; &#62; &#62; got me thinking, are you guys at Blizzard gonna have it to were two 
&#62; &#62; &#62; or more AIs can fight amongst each other? Cause if you do... this 
&#62; &#62; &#62; would be a great way to also test balancing issues. You can set up 
&#62; &#62; &#62; two computers to fight each other with different species, and you 
&#62; &#62; &#62; just sit back and watch the game. Find out which AI will win... and 
&#62; &#62; &#62; figure out why it won and if it's necessary to do some more tweaking, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; etc... Just a suggestion :-)
