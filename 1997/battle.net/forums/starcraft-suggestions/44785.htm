<blockquote>
<pre>This is in responce to &#34;Starcraft is a rip off of Starship 
troopers(the book, idiots)&#34; by SuTak.  More accuretly(spelling) 
to Datchery who responded to SuTak!

I personally don't know much about the book or the movie.  I am not 
really into reading books and shit like that. however, I was reading 
what SuTak was writing and he sounded more like a fagit trying to 
sound smart, rather than a forumer trying to bring up a good 
argument.  furthermore, I think that even if StarCraft was based on 
the movie &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; or the book, that the quality 
and fun factor of the game would not have changed.  As for you 
Datchery, you sould like level headed guy who is here for the reason 
that most of us are...          ... and that is, to talk about 
starcraft and not to rag on it, or blizzard for that matter.  As for 
SuTak... go to hell and stop critisizing(spelling).  That's all from 
me.  Later on people.
