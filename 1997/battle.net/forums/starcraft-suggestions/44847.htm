&#62; Dear Blizzard,
&#62; 
&#62; This idea is one that myself and others in the past mentioned but 
&#62; alas, I saw no response to...not even a &#34;go to hell&#34;!  Here 
&#62; 
&#62; is is anyway:

&#62; StarCraft, I take it, runs very much like WarCraft, in the sense that 
&#62; you control units, defeat your enemies, and voila, that's it!  Once 
&#62; you join another game on B.Net, everything happens much the same way. 
&#62;  Well, how about adding a little bit more depth to B.Net games?  What 
&#62; I mean is, instead of just giving players the chance to play &#34;one-
&#62; off&#34; games, why not create an entirely new Battle.Net server 
&#62; dedicated just to a StarCraft Galactic Campaign?  The Campaign could 
&#62; run as follows:
&#62; 
&#62; First of all, we'd all need some kind of Campaign patch to 
&#62; participate in this game facility! (I say patch because I don't want 
&#62; you guys going off to implement this now)  Each person can then enter 
&#62; a pre-set StarCraft Galaxy, filled with solar systems and planets 
&#62; etc.  Each player can then travel to certain solar systems and the 
&#62; planets within them.  If they are uninhabited, the player can claim 
&#62; this domain as his/her own.  If someone else owns it, the player must 
&#62; fight for it in the same manner as any Starcraft game.  The standard 
&#62; maximum of 8 players can join a battle as usual.
&#62; 
&#62; Once a planet is owned, the player can rename it and it is basically 
&#62; classed as a chatroom for all allies, but if an enemy attacks it, the 
&#62; player is given the option to either Defend or Let it Fall.  When 
&#62; players conquer planets and go offline, that specific planet cannot 
&#62; be instantly taken over by an online player for 24-48 hours as it is 
&#62; protected for that length of time.  Opponents can leave their name on 
&#62; that planet's Battle Roster so that if the planet's owner comes back 
&#62; online within the 24-48 hour limit, he/she is informed of the 
&#62; challenge.  If the time limit elapses and the owner still has not 
&#62; logged on, the planet is then free to be retaken instantly by any 
&#62; other player.
&#62; 
&#62; This extra galactic depth can make REALLY good use of the presently 
&#62; forming clans, and maybe eventually, one single clan will rise to 
&#62; dominance over the entire galaxy! :)  Please, if anyone feels the 
&#62; need to comment on this or other factors on this subject, feel free! 
&#62; :)

Yes!  I also agree that this would be simply, just too cool!  I just 
think we should wait to implement it to warcraft 3, or starcraft 2, 
because, I think quite a few aspects of the game would need to be re-
worked in order for it not be a just a cheesy multiplayer option.  I 
think we should really try to push for this feature in warcraft 3, as 
well as campaigns with branching storylines (a la wing commander) 
though, and if blizzard could implement this feature into starcraft, 
without having to mess with the game too much to make it good, then I 
say 'go man, go'.
