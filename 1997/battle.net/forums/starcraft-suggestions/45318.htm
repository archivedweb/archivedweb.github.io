&#62; &#62;   Um, chill. Just cause Twiggy/Neutralizer is a little *odd* and high 
&#62; &#62; on sugar, does not make all Mac users that way. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;    The DEC Alpha is NOT your typical PC. It runs a RISC chip (same 
&#62; &#62; technology Mac chips use-- so Mac chips suck, huh?) that runs the 
&#62; &#62; Intel instruction set. Problem: It still isn't totally compatible 
&#62; &#62; with all the Windows software you already have. It needs new, RISC-
&#62; &#62; compatible versions of the software for you to get the speed 
&#62; &#62; increase. It runs non-RISC software (aka everything you own) in 
&#62; &#62; emulation, which causes a tremendous speed hit. A PentiumII 266 will 
&#62; &#62; run non-RISC software FASTER than a DEC Alpha, my friend. And DECs 
&#62; &#62; cost $5,000 and up, plus all the new software you need...you got that 
&#62; &#62; kind of money?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Finally, the very latest Macs run 350 MHz, and with the new G3 
&#62; &#62; processor coming out, a same clock-speed Mac will wipe the floor with 
&#62; &#62; a Pentium II (I know, I didn't believe it either at first...) The Mac 
&#62; &#62; gets most games LATE, which sucks, and Twiggy needs a slapping...but 
&#62; &#62; if you think Macs suck, just take a lookie at that Win95 OS you're 
&#62; &#62; typing on...what do you think it's trying to be? You're kind of on a 
Mac already, my friend. Just because the company itself has it's head 
up it's own ass when it comes to business and marketing decisions, 
&#62; &#62; doesn't mean the computer sucks. Oh wait-- you're one of those people 
&#62; &#62; who had to use a circa-1985 Mac at your school and think that all 
&#62; &#62; Macs are still like that..I see now...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;              &#34;Somebody strap Twiggy down...&#34;
&#62; &#62;                    __Iolaus__
&#62; 

&#62; All this blabbing about clock speeds is making me sick, clock speeds 
&#62; aren't everything.  The system cache, motherboard frequency and 
&#62; multiplyer, and RAM are all a factor on how fast your computer runs.  
&#62; I don't know much about macintosh standards, but if any of these are 
&#62; slow on your system, it seriously bottlenecks the processor speed.
&#62; 
&#62; Hobbz

  That's absolutely true...and that's why Macs will probably WIDEN 
their speed edge over PCs in 1998.(1999 and beyond are a different 
story-- IBM & Motorola might decide to invest less R&D money in 
keeping the PowerPC chip ahead of Intel if Apple doesn't get it's act 
together...)

  Think about it-- Most current Macs have a 50 MHz bus speed, most 
PCs have a 66 MHz speed. A 300 MHz Mac (a pretty common speed for 
Macs now) has a multiplier of 6, while a 266 MHz Pentium II has a 
multiplier of only 4... which means the PC's CPU doesn't have to wait 
for the system bus to catch up as much as a current Mac's...also, a 
PII has Backside Cache, which means that the memory cache is linked 
directly to the CPU, at somewhere between 133 and 266 MHz, while many 
current Macs still have old-style cache, which runs at the system bus 
speed, which is 50 MHz. So the Pentium II doesn't have to wait as 
much for its' memory cache EITHER...Also, most current Macs don't 
support the newest and fastest kinds of RAM, like SRAM.

 Still, DESPITE all this, the tests (in PC magazines!) show an 
equivalent Mac is as fast or FASTER than a PII 266!!! How? Because of 
the AWESOME power of the Power PC chip! It's a RISC CPU (Reduced 
Instruction Set), which is a lot more powerful than the CISC 
technology STILL USED in the P II...it's quite amazing that Macs can 
still be faster when they are, in fact, competing with ONE HAND TIED 
BEHIND THEIR BACKS...

  RISC technology CPUs just rule...and RISC is why you got DEC Alphas 
flying at 500-600 MHz (too bad about the software not being backward 
compatible...)

  Now, THINK about it-- if PowerPCs are faster with slow busses and 
slow memory caches and slow RAM, WHAT do you think happens when Apple 
fixes all that? That's right-- they don't just beat Pentiums and 
Pentium IIs, they leave 'em in the dust! In February, Apple is 
releasing a new line of systems, that will have G3 RISC CPUs (the 
next generation of PowerPC chips), a 66 MHz system bus, a backside 
memory cache that will be far faster than caches that go through the 
system bus, and support for SDRAM. There is simply no technological 
way the Pentium II can hang with that...the overall Power PC system 
will be as high-performance as the best PCs, which means that the 
only real difference is the CPU...and the G3 is simply a MUCH more 
powerful chip than the PII, for the same or less money...

  This is where Microsoft becomes Intel's best friend-- since Windows 
is the standard in most markets, people will buy Wintel computers 
even though PowerMacs are faster...if it was just Intel Vs IBM, 
Motorola, and Apple, Intel gets blown out, on a hardware & 
performance basis. Just the facts.
