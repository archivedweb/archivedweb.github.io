&#62; engion and started over again(it still uses the war2 engion(sp) i 
&#62; think, I could be wrong)  so it's technicly been in production for 
&#62; less then 1.5 years, so they still have until e3 98 untill it's been 
&#62; in production for 2 years.

I think it actually has been two years already, since I think I 
remember a sheet included with Warcraft 2 about SC (that was two 
years ago).  Anyway, since the total redesign after E3 Blizzard has 
only been working on SC as we know it today for about a year.  

Blizzard did start work on Starcraft before E3 '96.  According to 
your timeline, production for SC would have to have started on the 
day of E3... I seriously doubt Blizzard put together a total 
conversion in the early morning hours before the convention. :)
