<blockquote>
<pre>1) Station17's section on the Protoss High Templer says &#34;These 
volatile units radiate such powerful psionic energy that they are 
forbidden to enter combat physically for fear of them accidentally 
unleashing a massive catastrophe.  Combining three or more of these 
units will create a Archon a truly powerful unit. They are center to 
the ability to use pisonic power.&#34; but I was told that they were 
some of the strongest fighters in the game.

2) Will you be able to control how a unit will react to an enemy like 
in Dark Reign?

3) When does the Christmas rush start?

4) On Station17 it said the Archons are energy beings does this meen 
they are composed of energy and have no real body?

5) Is the Zerg movie on Station17 real they say they got it off a 
pcgamer's CD or something?

6) Does the Archon have a limited time it lives (its health points 
slowly disapear until death?)

7) Can you give units or rescources or both to an allie?

8) Are their different extremes of war i mean at war neutral and 
allies?

9) Can the game be expect by atleast mid December?

10) Can suggestions be incorporated into the game still at this point 
and if so do you only incorporate the best?

11) Is an Archon worth three High Templers (hitpoints/armor)?

12) Can you name some suggestions that were actually incorporated 
onto the game?

13) How many units can be put into a group as in the groups that can 
be called but the # keys?

14) How big are the maps?

15) Can you make the maps as big as you want as in Dark Reign Enemy 
Nations?

16) Is there any way to build other races units other than the 
infested terran suicide bombers?

17) Is a full health not upgraded Zealot stronger than a full health 
not upgraded Ultralisk?

18) How about a full health not upgraded Goliath?

20) Can an Archon shoot at air units?

21) There are land and air units are there space and water units?

22) Do rescources regenerate slowly so a long game can keep going?

23) Since Arbiters can not be cloaked than the only air unit you can 
hide other than the lil Scout is the Carrier?

24) How many CDs will the finished version of StarCraft have 
1,2,3,4...?

25) The Clan part of Battle.net, what will it actually do?

26) Will there be expansions?

27) If yes will the expansions give new units and terran and stuff or 
just more missions?

28) I know you won't want to tell what they are exactly but are there 
any super weapons?

29) Early on it was said that you could put your own voice on your 
new units (altured heroes) is that still possible?

30) Will StarCraft be able to work over AOL?

31) How long do you estimate after the beta is released it will take 
to work out the bugs ect. ect. ect. and get the game on the shelves?

32) Can the Terran units that scavenge only get personal upgrades?

33) Can the Seige tank still turn into a tower?

34) Is a Dragoon stronger than a Zealot or High Templer none of which 
are damaged or upgraded?

35) Does mind control wear off or do the units under mind control 
slowly die?

36) Can buildings cloak?

37) Does an Archon mainly use spells or simple battle to destroy 
enemys?

39) Can you mind control neutral units?

40) can you see your allies explored area and mini map and stuff?

41) Can you control your allies units?</pre>
