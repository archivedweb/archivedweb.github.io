&#62; &#62; Im serious.  The last 6 messages from Blizzard have been &#34;We have

&#62; &#62; comments on the game.  Face it folks.  Their going to shift 
&#62; &#62; EVERYTHING into Lord of the Clans, like they did with Diablo.  Diablo 
&#62; &#62; is no fun!!!  Theirs too much cheating.  Blizzard has done best in 
&#62; &#62; the RTS field, and that is where they should stay.  Are you waiting 
&#62; &#62; to unveil Starcraft's revolutionary what-chamathinge at a convention 
&#62; &#62; or something?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Hunter
&#62; You are right about the releases, but the reason they shifted 
&#62; everything to Diablo is because it was supposed to be their next game 
&#62; and it was.  Also, there is no way to prevent cheating the way Diablo 
&#62; was set up to run, hackers will always be a step ahead.  First of 
&#62; all, hackers do not have to worry about their program crashing 
&#62; peoples' machines and they also do not have to make it small enough 
&#62; to be released to thousands of people at a time.  Diablo is fun, I 
&#62; played too much so not anymore for me, if you have someone to play 
&#62; with who doesnt cheat, just find people who are usually on the same 
&#62; time as you.  
&#62; Oh yeah, and Blizzard is revealing much of Starcraft at E3.

     When is E3, Vossman?</pre>
