<pre>&#62; I was thinking more along the lines of Huns, Visgoths, or Vandals for 
&#62; the Orcs.

I myself was thinking gauls....

&#62; Do Hannibal or Hamilcar ring a bell?  

yeah, but i'm not to familiar with them... maybe i can look it up

&#62; Ship range bonus for the Hittites, Egyptians have stronger chariots 
&#62; and something else. 

The hitties also get +1 all missile weapon range.... 
 
&#62; you don't NEED 50 villagers.  15-25 should be the most.

I know you dont need 50 villagers, i usually keep it to 20
myself....
 
&#62; People would whine even more if you had to do tactical combat with 
&#62; 1000s of units.
 
Well, you made reference to the realism of the game, i was just being
a brat about it. my bad :), but i still find it an annoyance....

&#62; Netstorm SUCKED.  I fell asleep while I was playing it.  It is 
&#62; nothing but C&C sandbagging being the only thing, and a child's 
&#62; puzzle block sidegame thrown in.  

I got all the technologies in that game, then it put me back down
to level 1, thats when i stopped playing...
  
&#62; Then hte Orc player clicks 3 times, and the speed is on full, and he 
&#62; jsut clicks on Ogre as fast as he can, and can win.  

can, but doesnt often, when i played on a more regular basis, i was
beating orcs left and right.... They relied too much on lust, and
ignored a lot of the more basic needs, protecting there resources.
Humans are also amazing at hit and runs, or hitting them before they
lust up...

&#62; Not really.  In games like Warcrap2, clicking fast is a substitute 
&#62; for thinking fast.  Not so in AOE, and REAL strategy games.

i dont agree here, and i prolly wont go here again, cause we could
spend thousands of posts arguing this one.  In reality, any real
time strategy game requires fast click, i dont believe this was a
substitute for real strategy any more then in aoe.  What did end
up happening is a lot of strategy was replaced with building orders.
Which is the 1 thing i like about aoe, random maps...  it makes it
so that you cant rely purely on knowing where to build in a certain
spot on the map...

- I still think war2 is a funner game...
     &#60;however historically inaccurate ;)&#62;</pre>
