&#62; &#62; I would just like to raise a point.  I know people who play TA over a 
&#62; &#62; network.
&#62; &#62; I know nothing about this game except what I've seen.  But what I do 
&#62; &#62; know is that
&#62; &#62; out of 75 units, they use about 4 or 5 of the &#34;best&#34; units.  
&#62; &#62; My point:  Why have 75 units
&#62; &#62; and use 4-5 when you can have 15 (just an example) that will all do a 
&#62; &#62; good job.  Like
&#62; &#62; I said, I've never played TA, so all the 75 units might be good, but 
&#62; &#62; I know a lot of people
&#62; &#62; who don't use nearly 20 of those 75.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Tas 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;             &#34;Oh!  Was that yours?&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; I've found that having an large assortment of units can be handy at 
&#62; times.  If any RTS player rely to much on 3 or 4 units, it'll 
&#62; eventually lead to his downfall.  Using a limited number of units 
&#62; might work best against Computer but certainly not any competent 
&#62; human opponents.  However, TA is just a silly and pointless game cuz 
&#62; once you have a fortified position, the other player will almost have 
&#62; to rely on Big Bertha and Nukes to win.  Assaulting any fortified 
&#62; postions w/ Annihiliators is suicide, even with a combination of 
&#62; kbots, tanks, and planes.  If you fail one or two assaults, the 
&#62; wreckage is gonna be a barrier for him.  Radar also provides a 
&#62; problem but that can be rectified by Jammers.  Cutting off their 
&#62; resources is also pointless because all they need is Power 
&#62; Generations and Metal converters to maintain their defense.  All in 
&#62; all, TA is not a very good example to demostrate the power of 
&#62; assortment of units considering so many of them does the same task.  
&#62; I find that in Dark Reign and War2 or even C&C, having the variety of 
&#62; units they have is very useful especially when you're facing a sticky 
&#62; defensive situation.  Those 3 RTS' I mentioned having a variety of 
&#62; units that have unique powers and uses.  If enemy is fortified fully, 
&#62; deathknights and Sappers can do the trick.  Grunt cheese or Ogres 
&#62; would provide normal assault in a normal game.  So basically, having 
&#62; a large variety of units that has UNIQUE abilities is good.  Not like 
&#62; TA where everything is fast paced and to have a successful strategic 
&#62; assault work accordingly will take a GREAT player to achieve which is 
&#62; generally too much work then its worth. 

Like I mentioned before, I know nothing about TA ( I used it as an 
example) and thanks telling me about the way it works, I didn't know 
about the wreckage stuff.  But in WC2, I have yet to see someone stop 
a 135-unit Ogre rush!  I've seen it several times, give or take a few 
units,  and is it devastating!  It's been used against me a few times 
too :)

     &#34;Oh!  So it WAS yours!  Good thing I found it!  You might 
have lost it!&#34;</pre>
