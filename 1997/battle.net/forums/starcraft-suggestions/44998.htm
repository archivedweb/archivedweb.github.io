&#62; ok now that i have gotten you're attention
&#62; anyone know when the damn thing is coming out????????????????

You are really stupid if you think that someone besides Blizzard 
would have much of an idea about when the beta is coming out.  Since 
you couldn't find any information (I hope you looked at the FAQ, 
which answers this very question), why do you think anyone else would 
have any more luck than you did?  If someone DID know, don't you 
think it would be everywhere by now?  Anything anyone [except 
verified blizzard employees (with the blue Blizzard by their name)] 
would tell you would be either a guess or a lie, and neither would 
come from Blizzard (the only people that really know, remember?).  
And Blizzard won't say anything about when the beta will be.
