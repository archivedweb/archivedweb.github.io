<pre>Did anyone else get this from Sutak? I'm just wondering if this guy 
is nuts or something...

&#62;hienlien 59. female pilots much later. 

And?

&#62;didnt say metal. just said ships. 

The ships in Starship Troopers(even the &#34;bug&#34; ships) are 
metal.

&#62;overlords are brains.

No, Overlords are Transports/Caretakers. In the book the BRAINS are 
the ones who needed caretaking.

&#62;i generaly have no knowledge or just no knowledge of starcarft. 
well ive
&#62;been with starcraft for a very long time. since war 2. since aj
&#62;starcraft site. before the suggestions forum. before diablo. 

And you're saying that I haven't? Besides which your &#34;being 
with&#34; SC has nothing to do with how much you actually KNOW about 
it. I KNOW about SC AND Starship Troopers.

&#62;yes i think i know that. and iolaus is sad sad sad. proper 
manners and
&#62;grammer are fit only for those who will apreciate it. you are 
fit only
&#62;for eye gouging and socket fucking

Actually proper manners are what is used to distinguish those who 
would otherwise be socially unfit from those who are. Poor grammar is 
for everyone, NOT just those of us who like to make our writing easy 
to read.  Myself I truly deplore it when people feel the need for 
profanity to &#34;prove&#34; their &#34;point&#34;. Your incessant 
use of this has lowered your status in my eyes considerably.


&#62;im insulting evey sunt(korrect spelling) who sits here always 
instead of
&#62;playing TA and DR and PI and the like. 

PI? And what is a &#34;sunt&#34;? also &#34;korrect&#34; isn't 
spelled correctly =)

&#62;oh its like the book.

I read an article in &#34;Preimiere&#34; magazine(a movie mag) in 
which the director said that it was only partially based on the book.

&#62;well until the movie comes out your just like every other civies 
around
&#62;here. clueless. um zerg no armor no weapons. uhh ouhh argg. 
awwwww.

Civies? Is that supposed to be a derogatory term to call me a 
civilian? Am I supposed to be inflamed with hatred? Is the term 
&#34;clueless&#34; meant to describe you or me? And that last bit 
about the Zerg is unbelieveably wrong.

&#62;buy TA or wait until starcraft come out. or boot up RA. email me 
then
&#62;we  trade lumps.

TA is 
A)A rush game
B)Has hugh requirements
C)way too many units for practicality

RA on the other hand is just plain boring.
