<pre>Hey Cruddy Critters!!!

Usually, I have something really useful to say when I post here... NO 
I DON'T!!  I'm a liar!!!  I usually say stupid stuff and everyone 
likes it except some critters who hate it.  But some critters don't 
hate it, they actually like it.  And I want to say thank you to the 
critters who like it and fooey on the critters who don't like it... 
as opposed to the critters who do.  So thank you critters who do and 
FOOEY on you critters who don't.

I also want to tell you to LOOK OUT cause I have a new strategy for 
those bloodlust bums out there and I'm gonna try it tonight on Kali!  
Can I say Kali here without getting paid?  I don't think that is 
allowed.  I think I have to get paid now... Well GOOD then!  I wanna 
get paid and I wanna get paid big time!  And if you don't want me to 
get paid then Fooey on YOU!  Yes YOU!  No not you... not you,

&#34;YOU!  You're the one who doubted me.&#34;
&#34;No&#34;
&#34;You're the one who said my Frog Of War would fail.&#34;
&#34;No&#34;
&#34;Awe... It's ok, c'mon... tell your Cruddy Captain&#34;
&#34;I...I, did.&#34;
&#34;Awe, it's ok&#34;
&#34;I, I did.&#34;
&#34;Awe yes... The Boombox!&#34;
&#34;Nooo!  Not the Boombox!  Noooo-noo-noooooo!&#34;
~ We're gonna party, YEAH!  We're gonna party, HEY! ~
Cha-cha-cha-cha cha,cha!  Cha-cha-cha-cha cha,cha!

Speaking of chaw, this guy at my work chews it and he sticks it under 
his upper lip and he looks like a bunny rabbit.

Speaking of bunny rabbits, I have a friend who has a bunny rabbit and 
all it does is poop.  Which is kinda cool cause my name is Cruddy and 
poop is kind of cruddy just like me! She also has a llama in her back 
yard, but it doesn't smell very bad cause they poop in a big pile. 
Llamas remind me of emu for some reason... I wonder why?  Maybe cause 
I needed a way to say...

Speaking of emu, I wonder what a person in Australia would say if 
they grew up eating emu and then ate chicken one day?  I'll bet that 
critter would say, &#34;Mmmm, Tastes just like EMU!&#34;

hehehe...ok, that was stupid but can you blame me?  I'm under too 
much pressure!! Everyone thinks that I am funny and I just cannot 
take it anymore!  What if this posts is stupid?  What if everyone 
replies and says that I used to be funny but I'm not funny any more!  
What if that happened?!  What would I do?  Oh, what would I do? I 
would end up posting dumb stuff about how great my webpage is and I 
would pretend that I was someone else saying great stuff about my 
webpage and I would get in flame wars with other clans and say that 
MY clan is better than YOUR clan is, even though we've never even 
PLAYED Starcraft before.  Besides, the only reason YOU are better 
than ME is cause YOU always use bloodlust on me and Blizzard never 
made me my Human Bloodlust patch!!!  I WANT MY BLOODLUST PATCH! I 
WANT IT NOW! NOW! NOW!!!

Ok Blizzard, I have warned you time and time again.  I have given you 
PLEANTY of time to gimmy my Human Bloodlust patch, and what do I get 
in return?  Some stupid uberlist thing that I don't know what the 
heck does!  SO, I'll give you one last chance.  If I do not get my 
patch soon, I'm gonna, uh.... I'm gonna..  I'm gonna tell everyone 
NOT to buy Starcraft!  YEAH!  What do you think about that eh?!  I'll 
bet you are shaking in your boots right now! HA!  If you even HAVE 
boots you pathetic, shoe-wearing, no-bloodlust-patch-making, 
slowpokes! If I had a REAL mage I would have him turn you all into 
critters!  Uh, hey... wait a second. Um, I'd turn you into something 
else! YEAH! Maybe I'd have him give you orc-hair or worse yet, Don 
King Hair!! HAHAHAHA!!!  I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE!!

Actually, if I really laughed in your face I'd probably get the crud 
kicked out of me... which is apropriate for my namesake.

Well, thank you for your time and Happy Easter to everyone!!!

I'm kinda upset cause I didn't get an Easter Basket this moring,
Cruddy Buddy

P.S. - I never post script anything cause they are dumb and ANYONE 
who P.S.'s EVEN ONCE is an idiot!!  uh, wait... never mind.</pre>
