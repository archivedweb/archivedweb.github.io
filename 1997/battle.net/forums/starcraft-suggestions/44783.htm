<pre>It seems to me that if the races were balenced in one on one play 
they would be relativly balence in mutiplayer play.  It might come 
down to who uses there early-game/middle-game/end-game advatage best, 
such as in Heros of Might and Magic 2, authough I hope Not.  In that 
case if the Protoss could survive long enough then they would win, 
The Zerg would have to strike in the begging when there numbers would 
be still advantagous, and the terrans would have to gain some 
advatages in the middle game for success.( in other words the would 
have to stike once they were stronger then the Zergs and when the 
protoss were still weaker then they were).

      But as I said above I hope that this beg/mid/end kind of 
balence isn't the case.  I'd like to see all three team be able to 
hold there own no matter how long the game has gone on. And if this 
is true then I imagine that all the teams in a muti-player match 
would be equal.

&#62; I think the three races will balance out pretty well in one-on-one

&#62; would rank them as such:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Protoss (strongest)
&#62; 2.  Zerg
&#62; 3.  Terran
&#62; 
&#62; In other words a team using all Protoss would be very difficult to 
&#62; defeat in my opinion if they work well together to produce units.  An 
&#62; an all Zerg team would obviously be terrifying due to sheer numbers.  
&#62; An all Terran team?  I don't know if they'd be as intimidating.
&#62; 
&#62; Now I know all of this is speculation since the beta isn't out but it 
&#62; does bring up the point that the racial balance might be much more 
&#62; difficult to maintain as more human players join in the battle.  I'd 
&#62; appreciate comments on what a good team would be (i.e., which races 
&#62; make the best combo) and how you feel about the rankings above.
