&#62; &#62;      Well, I do know that any small hole in youre suit in space and 
&#62; &#62; (poof) your body is mocroscopic drops of blood and bone dust. THis is 
&#62; &#62; becausethere is no airpushing back in on the person(lifeform) to hold 
&#62; &#62; him/her/it toghether. Also this could happen on planets like Mars 
&#62; &#62; where the atmosphere is more dense. Will you be done in SC. Also in 
&#62; &#62; space there is no max speed. There is no friction to slow you down. 
&#62; &#62; You'd jsut keep accelerating. And to turn you would not inly have to 
&#62; &#62; change direction but fire a rocket fuel boost the direction you went 
&#62; &#62; last so it would be neat if you saw counterboosts when airborne space 
&#62; &#62; units tuned or stopped. One last thing that isn't really physics. 
&#62; &#62; Behomeths shjould not be able to fly in anatmosphere. Addin heat 
&#62; &#62; tiles to survive entry/re-entry to something that big (mabye this is 
&#62; &#62; physics) would add several tons of weright wich in our current RL 
&#62; &#62; time period would add several thousand dollars to the cost of 
&#62; &#62; shipping the buillding materials (completed ship) into space.
&#62; 
&#62;         Ok, if you want to talk physics, then you've made a whole lot 
&#62; of mistakes in your message.  First of all, a person wouldn't explode 
&#62; if there's a hole in his spacesuit.  Instead all the air and oxygen-
&#62; rich blood will come out of his nose, ears, mouth.  This is because 
&#62; there's air more pressure in a human body then in space(none in 
&#62; space) so all the air will move out into space.  So theoritically you 
&#62; could still live for as long as you hold your breath but then you'll 
&#62; just die w/o oxygen.  No fancy explosions.  Second there's a limit to 
&#62; how fast a ship can go in space-it's light speed.  That's the basis 
&#62; for relativity.  It's true that the ships would keep accelerating of 
&#62; the rockets are on, but they don't have to decelerate to zero and 
&#62; then turn the engines in the opposite direction to turn around.  They 
&#62; could just turn on a rocket on the side of the tail to turn around.  
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;     But this is all real physics but I'm sure the ships in SC will 
&#62; have a whole bunch of &#34;Star Trek&#34; technology on them like 
&#62; warp speed, instant stop etc.

you are also incorect about what would happen if you had a hole in 
your space suit, you were right about the capilaries in your nose and 
eyes and anywhere else close to the skin rupturing and uzing blood, 
but since you are losing pressure around your body you would also get 
decompression sickness, otherwise known as the bends, all the little 
tiny bubbles of gas (mostly nitrogen being that is the major 
ingreedient of air) in your blood would expand, causing excrutiating 
pain starting at your joints and moving to the rest of your body, and 
eventually killing you (air bubbles and your heart/brain don't mix 
very well).
