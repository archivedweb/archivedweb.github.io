&#62; I would just like to raise a point.  I know people who play TA over a 
&#62; network.
&#62; I know nothing about this game except what I've seen.  But what I do 
&#62; know is that
&#62; out of 75 units, they use about 4 or 5 of the &#34;best&#34; units.  
&#62; My point:  Why have 75 units
&#62; and use 4-5 when you can have 15 (just an example) that will all do a 
&#62; good job.  Like
&#62; I said, I've never played TA, so all the 75 units might be good, but 
&#62; I know a lot of people
&#62; who don't use nearly 20 of those 75.  
&#62; 
&#62; Tas 
&#62; 
&#62;             &#34;Oh!  Was that yours?&#34;

I've found that having an large assortment of units can be handy at 
times.  If any RTS player rely to much on 3 or 4 units, it'll 
eventually lead to his downfall.  Using a limited number of units 
might work best against Computer but certainly not any competent 
human opponents.  However, TA is just a silly and pointless game cuz 
once you have a fortified position, the other player will almost have 
to rely on Big Bertha and Nukes to win.  Assaulting any fortified 
postions w/ Annihiliators is suicide, even with a combination of 
kbots, tanks, and planes.  If you fail one or two assaults, the 
wreckage is gonna be a barrier for him.  Radar also provides a 
problem but that can be rectified by Jammers.  Cutting off their 
resources is also pointless because all they need is Power 
Generations and Metal converters to maintain their defense.  All in 
all, TA is not a very good example to demostrate the power of 
assortment of units considering so many of them does the same task.  
I find that in Dark Reign and War2 or even C&C, having the variety of 
units they have is very useful especially when you're facing a sticky 
defensive situation.  Those 3 RTS' I mentioned having a variety of 
units that have unique powers and uses.  If enemy is fortified fully, 
deathknights and Sappers can do the trick.  Grunt cheese or Ogres 
would provide normal assault in a normal game.  So basically, having 
a large variety of units that has UNIQUE abilities is good.  Not like 
TA where everything is fast paced and to have a successful strategic 
assault work accordingly will take a GREAT player to achieve which is 
generally too much work then its worth. </pre>
