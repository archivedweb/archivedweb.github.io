<pre>        I am just going to list some suggestions for Battle.Net.  I 
think they are all original, but if someone has recently posted one, 
I give them some credit.  Not ALL credit, mind you.  but SOME credit 
:)


    1.  The locate-user button:  They should definetely have one of 
these.  The idea is the same as the one for Diablo, you type /whois 
or whatever and the person's name.  It will then tell you if the 
person is currently logged on, and where they are.  This would be 
much more valuable for Starcraft than it was for Diablo, because 
Starcraft can handle many more multiplayer options.  Expanding on 
this idea,, There should be an official way to join a clan.(if anyone 
has played subspace, you know about how the squad shows up by your 
name and such.)  You could enter the name of the clan you want to 
join (or make), and then the name of the clan would appear with the 
/whois button.  Also, though it might cause some problems, would be 
the inclusion of the clan's insignia in the list of people logged on. 
 Here is an ex: You log onto battle.net  You are presented with the 
list of names, as usual.  But, beside the name of each person that is 
currently a member of a clan, there appears a little symbol (a 
burning sword, a heart, a eagle, etc.)  That would make it easier for 
clan disputes and fights.  You could either choose from a list of pre-
drawn symbols, or draw your own.

2. A huge universe map:  I got this idea from the game over at 
StarLeague, and expanded on it a little J  What it is is a large map, 
made up of stars, comets, planets, suns, asteroid belts, meteor 
showers, blackholes, etc.  What you do is, as a clan, fight another 
clan for a piece of it.  You have to challenge another clan, and then 
officially fill out a form of some sorts.  Then, when the game is 
over, that star/planet/etc. that you fought over now says : Under 
control of and the name of the victorious clan.  The fight for the 
entire map would go on for weeks, until there were just 2 clans 
controlling the entire map.  THEN, there would be a huge battle, with 
al kinds of special attributes that regular battles don't have:  
Maybe there can be more than 8 players fighting at one time, and then 
there could be even more people spectating , or something.  The clan 
that wins gains control of the entire map, and all the members are 
ranked first on the ladder (I will get to the ladder later J ).  The 
Clan also receives lots and lots and lots of points, and will 
effectively be the &#34;clan to beat.&#34;  After a couple of days, 
the entire map is either A. entirely demolished, and a new, unseen 
one takes it place or B. the map is erased, and no clan owns any 
territory other than its starting piece, which is randomly chosen.  I 
think this would be cool, and help the multiplayer aspects of 
Starcraft  continue for months and months.

3.    There should definetely be some type of ladder, and hear is my 
idea for one:  The ladder is made up of two smaller ladders, one for 
person-person score standings, and one for clan-clan score standings. 
 These two ladders meet at the top to show the #1 clan and #1 player. 
 The ladder could be a feature of Battle.Net, like a channel that you 
go to to sign up for battles, post messages, etc.    You initially 
sign up for the ladder their, (when you do that, you give them your 
nick, your clan [if you have one], and your clan's symbol [again, if 
you have one]).  The ladder would kind of look like this:

			       1    2	
            3   4   5                                       6   7  8 
            9   10  11                                      12  13 14


   The left column is for each player, the right for each clan.  The 
#1 is for the best individual player, and the #2 is for the best 
clan.  The #3 is a person's chosen name, the #4 is where their symbol 
goes, and the #5 is for their points.  Everytime you win a game, you 
receive a number of points, according to the winning factors (how 
many men killed, resources harvested, how many buildings razed, etc.  
Just like the War2 screen).  The more points you have, the higher on 
the ladder you go. (A suggestion for this:  I think it would be a 
cool idea if there was an official way to hire a mercenary.  Let's 
say you are scheduled to fight a 4 on 4 battle, and want to ensure 
your chances of winning.  You can post a message saying &#34;I will 
give 1000 points to anyone willing to hire on for a game with 
me&#34;.  Then, someone would reply, and you could make an agreement 
or something, and transfer the points to their account.  Adds some 
economic values to the game.)

  That is all I can think of right now, but will post more soon.  
Feel free to add any ideas of your own, along with comments, 
questions, and stuff like that :)

                                                                      
                                       Thanks,
