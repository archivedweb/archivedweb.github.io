&#62; &#62; Blizzard,

&#62; &#62; 

&#62; &#62; This was in my other message but a race editor would really be great! 

&#62; &#62; Think of it. Players could make their own races by drawing sprites 

&#62; &#62; and makeing their weaknesses and strengths and then players could 

&#62; &#62; draw their own buildings!!



Here is ONE new building. You don't even want to know how long this 
took. I did it a short while ago using nothing but Photoshop's pencil 
tool.

<a href="http://www.arts.ucsb.edu/122i/projects/thompson/oddsnends/OrcReactor.j">http://www.arts.ucsb.edu/122i/projects/thompson/oddsnends/OrcReactor.j</a>

Look at this and ask yourself how many of these you could sit down 
and do right now. In fact, sit down right now and start drawing a new 
building. It must be the same general style and quality as those from 
Blizzzard, must use the correct pallete, and must fit into the game's 
perspective. See how far you get.



&#62; &#62; Please Blizzard, I don't care how &#34;choppy&#34; the editor for 

&#62; &#62; that is, heck, I'll even do it with ResEdit (I have a mac) , 



Res-Edit is cool.





&#62; 	This idea is great, but unrealistic.  This will probably not be an 

&#62; option for ANY RTS for a very long time because it would either 



&#62; require true physics (you drawing a few views of a sprite, the 

&#62; computer manipulating it),  &#60;[No way on that one.  Forget it, 
you're going to have to prodoce every view yourself.]



or hours upon hours spent at the computer 

&#62; drawing picts.  



I agree with you here. No way I'm going to hand-draw sixteen views of 
every ship for every view of every animation. This would take MONTHS. 
But it's NOT altogether  impossible. I could create one unit with 
little trouble. I model it in Ray Dream Studio, set up keyframe 
animation for each action (walking, shooting, sitting still, dying), 
render one batch over a bluescreen, rotate 15º, render another batch, 
rotate, repeat 16 times. Then I touch up the views in Photoshop and 
paste them into the editor.



How many people can do this? The majority of people who play games 
don't have the artistic or 3D modeling ability. Others (and this is 
the part that really bothers me) could create really crappy looking 
units that are _obviously_ not from Blizzard. So there would be a lot 
of homemade crap because everyone has this tool but they don't have 
the skills to use it right. 



&#62; 	Again, this is a great idea, however fantastic.  There could be, 

&#62; however, simple ways to edit the races, like replacing the sprites or 

&#62; adding units to existing races, but that falls short of creating a 

&#62; new race.



That's what I said in an earlier post. A single-unit editor would be 
a lot more feasible than a race editor. And if you think about it, 
it's really the same thing. If you replace all the units of a race 
one by one, you'd have in effect created a new race. But no amateur 
game enthusiast has the skills and the time to do that.  Most people 
think &#34;It would be cool to make my own race&#34; but they have no 
idea of the scale of the job they're talking about when they say that.

I think it would be cool to make another ship in a style that was 
clearly Protoss or another building that was obviously Zerg (Hopefuly 
you can tell my reactor is Orcish...) and add it to the game so it 
fit in nicelly with the others.



I'd also like to add that whoever said that they should release a 
unit editor AFTER the game comes out was right. Don't let it delay 
the game by trying to build it into the map editor at the last 
minute. Let us all finish the single-player scenario and have some 
fun on BattleNet and then when the game's newness starts wearing off, 
then spring the finished unit editor on us. Someone might even have 
finished all the frames for one new unit by then.</pre>
