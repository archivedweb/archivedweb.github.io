&#62; First, thought id say that a full time or two Blizzard corp staff 
&#62; member ansewering questions with such regularity shows to me true 
&#62; dedication on the part of the game company to its constituancies.  
&#62; After all, this is a 'sequal' in a way to the RTS genre begun by 
&#62; War2, and what could be better than tons of suggestions?  Im sure 
&#62; most are only considered on their merits and limitations, but im sure 
&#62; every now and then a really good simple one suprises the company 
&#62; pleasantly.
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, my questions were on the documentation, either online or in 
&#62; the box, as well as the packaging of the game:
&#62; 
&#62; 1. -- Will the manual be online?  If so, will it be interactive?  
&#62; Manuals have two functions --  to tell you how to install (rather 
&#62; obsolete with autoplay,) and play the game, and to immerse you in the 
&#62; story line of the game so as to make it a living world rather than 
&#62; just some cartoons blowing eachother up.  Now most older people 
&#62; prob.ly don't care all that much about the storyline, but for younger 
&#62; players its essential to connect them to the universe, rather than 
&#62; the gameplay; just the opposite.
&#62;        So how have you thought out the documentation?  If you want my 
&#62; suggestions, id would seperate the two functions to seperate docs. 
&#62; One should be paper, the other online.  But keep them VERY seperate.  
&#62; And lose any childishness for the howto docs, so the older folks 
&#62; don't get embarressed reading it.  But the other doc can emmerse in 
&#62; thourough detail the imagination of the player.  I would make the 
&#62; background/story one the paper one in the box, and the instructions 
&#62; online (a pop-up autoplay manual, not that crappy Adobe Acrobat 
&#62; format -- i HATE that!)  So if ya cared less who was who, chunk the 
&#62; inbox manual, or dont even open it (most people dont look at manuals 
&#62; till there stuck anyway).  Its these little points which make a good 
&#62; game even better.
&#62; 
&#62; 2. -- Quickie:  What kind of ingame help will there be?  A good fun 
&#62; easy help system is always a bonus, and yall know erganomics well 
&#62; enough....
&#62; 
&#62; 3. -- The box packaging?  I thought diablo wouldve been better with a 
&#62; black box and just the name.  Advertizing advertizing,  know but its 
&#62; important.  Maybe you could have several choises and let the beta 
&#62; testers choose at the end of the beta test...?
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for reading, 
&#62; 
&#62; Sincerely,
&#62; Joshua

I'll look into what help features the game itself will offer, but 
Starcraft will include both inbox and online instructions and 
support.  The manual in the box will be all you need to install and 
play the game (and will include the cool story), but you will also be 
able to come to the Blizzard and battle.net web sites for 
announcements and technical support.

More Starcraft forums will be added to www.battle.net where one can 
receive feedback from other players as well as Blizzard personnel.  
Battle.net itself will add further support for Starcraft (including 
live technical support sessions with Blizzard reps).

This isn't to say you will have technical problems with the game, 
but, if you have a question, many paths to the answer will be 
available :)

Pat N.</pre>
