&#62; what's the deal with the battlecruiser. According to the Terran web 
&#62; site it has 3 weapons, massive shields etc. Will it be too powerful 
&#62; or will it have some flaws? I'd like to know. Thanks

I'm sure the Battlecruiser will be pretty tough to beat (and, 
therefore, very expensive and difficult to acquire).  But keep in 
mind that those things aren't just going to be on luxury cruises over 
enemy bases... &#34;Ahhh, there's a Nexus... ZAP!  Why not take out 
the Pylon? ZAP!&#34;  

The Protoss as well as the Zerg (despite everyone's claims to the 
contrary) will each have strong air units to combat the Battlecruiser 
as well as (I'm assuming) some form of anti-aircraft defense.  I 
would also expect the Battlecruiser to have some kind of weakness; 
every &#34;super-unit&#34; does.  It might be slow, or very 
vulnerable to a certain weapon, something to keep it from being 
invincible.

          donut!  There is a poison donut, isn't there Smithers?

Smithers: No sir, I talked with our lawyers and they say it would be  
         regarded as murder.
