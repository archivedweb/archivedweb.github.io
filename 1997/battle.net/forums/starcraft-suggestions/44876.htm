<pre>Yes, this question has been asked before.  The argument posed
by Blizzard is that there is no release date whatsoever and that
it can't be pushed back  if it doesn't exists.  The fact that the 
users
are making good suggestions is not delaying the game.  It is the
fact that the game will be done when Blizzard feels there is nothing 
more they can reasonably put into the game.  They said it will
be out this year, which most likely puts StarCraft out around 
December timeframe.  If it comes out sooner, be shocked.

Quoth the Raven, &#34;NEVERMORE!&#34;

&#62; I know someone asked a question similar to this earlier, but I don't

&#62; release date (yes, I know there is no &#34;official&#34; release 
&#62; date) is being moved back farther and farther as we keep giving the 
&#62; designers just one more cool feature that has to be in there, or the 
&#62; game will never be worth playing.  O random Bliz. rep reading this 
&#62; posting, could this be delaying the game?  And to everyone else, 
&#62; maybe it's time we stopped trying to improve a good game and actually 
&#62; see how good it is.  In other words, more posts and suggestions 
&#62; aren't really necessary at this point.  Otherwise, there won't be any 
&#62; room for Starcraft 2, will there?  :)
