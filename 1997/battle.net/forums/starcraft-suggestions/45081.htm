&#62; I was reading one of recent posts dealing with balanced sides. One of 
&#62; the replies pointed out that, it is a common mistake that most 
&#62; players see someone winning because of the race they choose and not 
&#62; because of their skill level. This has happen a lot in Warcraft 2, 
&#62; were bloodlusted ogres are viewed as the winning team.  However it 
&#62; got me thinking, are you guys at Blizzard gonna have it to were two 
&#62; or more AIs can fight amongst each other? Cause if you do... this 
&#62; would be a great way to also test balancing issues. You can set up 
&#62; two computers to fight each other with different species, and you 
&#62; just sit back and watch the game. Find out which AI will win... and 
&#62; figure out why it won and if it's necessary to do some more tweaking, 
&#62; etc... Just a suggestion :-)

This could work for refining and balancing AI's, but won't really 
show how the races would work against eachother when controlled by a 
human player.  This balancing requires human playtesters, both at 
Blizzard and during the beta.

Computers and humans just do things too differently.  For examble, in 
WC II, computer Paladins are very effective at healing eachother 
during combat.  However, it is very difficult for a human toissue the 
heal commands while the Paladins are running around during combat.

On the other hand, people do things the computer doesn't think of.   
A sufficiently smart AI could do a lot (ex Deep Blue), it still 
wouldn't be as creative and adaptive.  While the chess problem can be 
reduced easily to a fixed set of options, this is more difficult in a 
RTS game.  Finding the exact position for a tower, timing attacks, 
etc are things that are often more feel than calculation.

Another example comes from Dark Reign.  In DR, a scout can look like 
a tree and the computer will only find it if it moves when one of 
it's units can see it.  A human player on the other hand, could miss 
the movement if something was happening elsewhere, but could notice a 
tree was there that wasn't before and even if the scout was smart and 
hid at the location of an identical tree, would probably find the 
scout by attacking trees when artillery shells started landing in the 
area.</pre>
