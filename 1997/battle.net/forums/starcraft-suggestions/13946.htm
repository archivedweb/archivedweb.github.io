&#62; Hey all...
&#62; 
&#62; I noticed something.  Blizzard has recently put a lot of effort 
&#62; behind Lord of the Clans, pushing it hard on their web page and such. 
&#62;  They have also said nothing about Starcraft recently-- their entire 
&#62; web page is now devoted to LOTC.  It seems to me that Blizzard is 
&#62; putting all their effort behind LOTC (especially since their web page 
&#62; says that it will be out by the holidays) and doing less with 
&#62; Starcraft.  Now I don't know a hell of a lot about game development, 
&#62; so if I seem ignorant, I am-- please help me.  However, I didn't 
&#62; think that it would be possible to put out two games of Blizzard 
&#62; quality within 3 or 4 months of each other.  Is this possible?  Or is 
&#62; Blizzard screwing over Starcraft?
&#62; 
&#62; Please keep in mind that these are only my thoughts... in random 
&#62; order ;-).  It is not my intention to insult, scare, or otherwise 
&#62; play with people's minds.  Please post all your thoughts, but email 
&#62; me them too-- I recently had to switch from an Ethernet connection to 
&#62; a 14.4k modem, and it's culture shock.  I can't check this forum at 
&#62; all hours anymore ;-(.  Thanks in advance.  Later...

I don't think you have anything to worry about Firebrand.  Game 
development is usually done by fairly small, tight-knit teams that 
know a great deal about the product there making.  In other words the 
team that's sweating LOTC is not necessarily the same group of people 
beating out SC.  Blizzard currently has about 75 people in their 
roster.  I would think that with that many people they could easily 
have 2 or 3 teams developing totally disjoint products.  The only 
bottle neck might be that these different games are marketed by a 
single marketing group(probably true).  This, however, would not 
effect the playability or development of Starcraft.</pre>
