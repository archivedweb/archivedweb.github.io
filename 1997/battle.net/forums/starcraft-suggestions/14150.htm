&#62; 	Ugly (assuming you really ARE Ugly the Cute, and not an imitator)

******************************************
This if course would be instantly cleared up by looking at the host 
from whence the post came.  Even you should have been able to figure 
that out by now Iolaus.  Perhaps I over-estimated you intelligence...
******************************************
&#62; 
&#62;   You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
&#62; Somms has
&#62; 
&#62; --made Krowa leave the forum
****************************
I would think this would be a plus Iolaus... you two have something 
going on that the Forum doesn't know about?
****************************

&#62; --stated that Alchemy's mother does sailors for five bucks a pop
****************************
Ok! Ok! I am sorry!  It was 3 bucks.  Can't a person make a mistake?!
Jeez...
****************************

&#62; --called Drunk Master Chan a motherf***er
****************************
This is wrong actually.  I called him a motherf*cker.  The other two 
asteriks are silent.
*****************************

&#62; --has had his posts vaped several times by Bliz Support and laughed 
&#62; about it
*****************************
This is true somewhat.
*****************************

&#62; --insulted many people for no other reason than he doesn't like their 
&#62; suggestion
*****************************
Iolaus--your wrong again.  It really wasn't their suggestions that 
bugged me inasmuch as their existence.  So far your1 for 5.  That's 
pretty lousy.  I hope you never play for the Sonics.
*****************************
&#62;     
&#62;   If this is what you want to defend, you're welcome to it. The guy 
&#62; is an ass, and everyone knows it. People insult him with good reason. 
&#62; He insults you in his reply and you say &#34;Well put.&#34; You sound 
&#62; like an Ugly imitator, or at least, somewhat strange.
******************************
Iolaus you have stooped too low.  You are kicking this kid when he is 
down in front of the whole goddamn forum.  Let me be the bad-@ss--
your not very good at it.  Why don't you go back to being that smarmy 
little goody-two-shoes guy I came to know and abuse?  It seemed 
people liked you more then.  And after all that's all you really care 
about isn't it?
*******************************

&#62;   Like I said, the guy seems somewhat disturbed. It happens on the 
&#62; Internet. At the least, he is very immature, his actions prove it. He 
&#62; has never apologized for his lame crap, unless you count a weak one 
&#62; to Alchemy after he totally crossed the line. 
*******************************
That wasn't an apology.  I actually felt sorry for the guy.  I mean 
really..sheep AND sailors?  That's and awful thing for Alchemy to 
find out about his mother...
******************************

He's nice for ONE post 
&#62; and you want to make nicey nice with him? I dunno Ugly, I think his 
&#62; fear of banning is talking. 
*****************************
Iolaus get this through your gushy-granola-eating-pot-smoking-animal-
loving-pie-in-the-sky-every-thing's-hunky-dory-won't-you-be-my-
neighbor thick skull...
I don't care if:
    -Support tries to ban me or not.
    -People like me or not.
    -I am forgiven for my cyber-transgressions.
While these may be life and death matters to you they are not of much 
concern to me.
****************************

Or maybe you're right, contrary to his 
&#62; post, he wants to be friendly. Awww, how CUTE Somms. You sensitive 
&#62; guy, you.
&#62; 
&#62;   All I can say, whoever you are, is that Somms has made his own bed. 
&#62; Just because he is too pathetic to get the clue that no one wants him 
&#62; around doesn't mean we have to be nice to him. I'll leave him alone 
&#62; if he stops flaming people for making suggestions. 
*********************************
Translation: I am freaking scared of SOMMS and the way he embarrases 
me in front of everybody all the time and if he wants to quit that's 
sure fine by me!!!
Sorry Iolaus this will not happen.
*********************************

Blizzard can take 
&#62; care of his really awful stuff with vapes like they've been doing.
&#62;    I'll hold my nose and tolerate Somms presence on the forum 
&#62; because, after all, the guy has no life and isn't going to go 
&#62; anywhere. 
********************************
That's pretty big-headed talk coming from some loser taking beginning 
C programming courses from dumpy Foothills Community College 
nestled in smoggy Los Altos California.  Tell me Ioluas...did 
Professor Berry flunk you or did you have to do alot of EXTRA-CREDIT 
to get by? 
********************************

It's kind of sad. Indeed, I think it'll be really cool to 
&#62; make him into a nice enough guy, which is where he's headed if all 
&#62; his posts continue to be like the last one.
*******************************
Translation:  I hope he'll be my pal 'cause I'm tired of him kickin' 
my @ss!
*******************************

 But he's kind of immature 
&#62; too, so we'll have to remind him of his attitude problem from time to 
&#62; time. You know how kids are.  :)
&#62;  					    __Iolaus__

*******************
Beautiful ending Iolaus.  Did you wright that all by yourself or did 
you have to get Mr. Rogers to fly all the way out to Silicon Valley 
to help you?.  

   If you have to pick on Ugly the Cute to help fuel your stupid lame 
@ss war with me you are a bigger waste of skin than I originally 
thought you were.  In the future direct your comments at me instead 
of focusing them at defenseless individuals that may frequent this 
forum.  This is cowardly and shameful and won't be tolerated.  It 
really illustrates, Iolaus, how weak you really are.
                                              --SOMMS</pre>
