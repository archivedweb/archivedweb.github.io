&#62; you can't see anymore but keeps it in some kind of small memory pool 
&#62; or something so that it can bring that same map back up when you come 
&#62; back to it.  I think this would be so awesome because then there 
&#62; would be no edges and you would have to defend all sides.  Much more 
&#62; realistic.  Reply to this message and mention any flaws or bad things

Uh, I think I see a fatal flaw already.  Couldn't a player in 
trouble(or just someone who wants to be annoying) simply keep running 
away indefinetly in one(or more((shudder)) directions until they 
recover(or the other player quits in disgust)? Also since I have 
heard that the zerg get stronger as they age a zerg player could just 
set a few squads outta range and let them grow.    Also how would you 
have it 'lose' spots of the map if someone started to put small 
patrols in every section.  Eventually the cpu wouldn't be able to 
handle it.  What I would like to see on the maps is that the units 
would be able to go just off the screen to go around barriers and 
such that extend to the edge.  That way someone would have to build 
all around themselves in order to wallin.  It would also eliminate 
some of the advantage that players who start in the corners would get.</pre>
