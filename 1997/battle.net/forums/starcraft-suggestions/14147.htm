<blockquote>
<pre>	To the Assembled Throng:

  All the veterans here have their favorite suggestions that they'd 
love to see in SC. Some of the below are other peoples' suggestions 
and some are mine.


1) Protoss 'mental confusion' power or Terran Electromagnetic Pulse 
Bombs: Both would have the ability to cause all enemy units within 
the affected area to be Ungroupable, i.e. if you wanted to give a 
Confused or EM-Pulsed unit an order, you would have to select that 
unit and ONLY that unit in order to do so. They cannot co-ordinate 
with any other units, cannot be part of a group selection, etc. Wears 
off after a time. Certain upgrades can reduce the effects.

2) Interactive terrain (destructible natural bridges, false ground, 
large moving ice floes that light units could get on, etc.)

3) Dangerous critters (sea monsters that attack, etc.)

4) Town Hall/ Base FIRST (Barracks/ Unit Producing Buildings cannot 
be built first, limiting skill-less 'grunt rush' early knock-outs)

5) Units leave tracks or visible signs of passage on some terrain 
(which can also be erased by certain kinds of weather, like rain or 
snowfall)

6) Terrain conversion by weaponry (forests to forest fires that 
spread, ice to water, etc.)

7) Units having believable Acceleration & De-acceleration 
characteristics when starting and ending movement. 

8) Protoss towers that help units within their radius of influence 
regenerate psionic 'mana' more quickly

9) Being able to include Screen Captures in player-created Mission 
Briefings

10) Zerg 'chameleon', auto-bloodlust when wounded, extra-limbs (for 
attacking multiple units simultaneously), super-leaping, and 
climbing/clinging abilites (as Upgrades) Also, Zerg 'radioactivity' 
upgrade: affects nearby enemy units as reverse regeneration.

11) Buildings that can house units, in the way that Transports can. A 
small Base (aka 'Town Hall') can hold, say, 6 units, a Medium one 
('Keep') can hold 9, and a Large one ('Castle'), 12. Useful for 
sheltering 'peasants' from enemy attacks and discouraging early 
'grunt rushes' (Suprise! I really do have combat units, Mr.Rusher!)

12) Spy units that are undetectable except at very short range, thus 
forcing enemy Base camps to Patrol constantly

13) Some types of Terrain being passable only by light units (Forest, 
Jungle, Alien Ruins, etc.)

14) Super-Rapid Deployment: 'Crash pods' that Dropships can mass-
release on the fly, which freefall then de-accelerate at the last 
moment (retrorockets), then crash-land and release one light unit 
each (Marauders, say)

15) Preliminary Instructions: Being able to give orders to a unit 
under construction, which will execute those orders as soon as it is 
completed. (Helps with Unit Management, since you only stop in at 
your Barracks once: Order construction & give Orders at the same 
time.)

16) Simple player-creatable macros that automate a short series of 
repetitive orders, or, at the least, Sniper, Attack Area, and other 
new Command buttons for all units.

17) Minimap functions: Blow it up to full screen via one keystroke, 
and lay down a alphanumerical grid over it with one keystroke, so 
that we can order allied players to exact locations and co-ordinate 
quickly and easily (Dentarg, rendezvous with me at A-27 
immediately...) Good for calling in airstrikes too, especially if 
multiple battles are raging and things are getting confusing.



		That's most of them. All I can say is: Please, Blizzard. Pretty 
please?
