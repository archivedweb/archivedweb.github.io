&#62; answer. So Please Answer.
&#62;                   Ok say you have some of the same units that have a 
&#62; special attack like death and decay etc... can they do it all at the 
&#62; same time if you had like 9 of them or two of them. Another thing is 
&#62; maybe say you have like 3 of one type unit 4 of another and 5 of 
&#62; another can you select all of them and say they all had special 
&#62; attacks like lust,runes,D&K you would be able to use each attack by 
&#62; click on icon and then that group could do that specific attack but 
&#62; you would still have the others selected and they could do their 
&#62; special attack?

Yes, in Starcraft you can group cast (select a group and cast a spell 
w/it)

&#62;                    Say when your zurg are burrowed underground and an 
&#62; enemy unit walks over the land where they are or near where they are 
&#62; can he see them. And if so will they have the same eye site of the 
&#62; ground above if they were standing on the same spot above ground as 
&#62; they are when they are burrowed into the ground?

Nope, zerg are (for all practical reasons) invisible while underground

&#62;                    If your work units in starcraft such as peons in 
&#62; war2 if they get attacked while mining resources will they run fight 
&#62; back or what?

Not sure whether they will run or fight, but they WILL resume work 
instead of sitting around when the attack is over.

&#62;                    Also say you give a goliath an order to move to 
&#62; such and such a spot and he gets attacked on the way will he fight 
&#62; back or just keep going?

He will probably fire while he is going and maybe if they keep 
attacking he would stay and fight

&#62;                    The last question is when a zurg captures a SVC 
&#62; unit and can then make terran buildings and units will the units you 
&#62; make be able to burrow like the regular zurg units can?

My guess is no, because only the ACTUAL zerg species can burrow. 
&#62;                             Thanks for ya time
Glad to help,
