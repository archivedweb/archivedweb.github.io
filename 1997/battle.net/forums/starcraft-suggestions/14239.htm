<pre>Here's the rest of 'em. Sorry for taking up so much forum space.
Hmm, wish I had a web page. Then I could just link to my big list...

Anyway, some of these suggestions are well over 6 months out of date! 
Historical interest only....




UNITS
-----

1) Grenades might be a good weapon to put in the game. It would be a 
good way to upgrade marines.

2) Units should respond promptly. Even the slow units should act on 
an order right away.

3) Units with turrets should be able to fire them while moving.

4) Tanks, mechs and other ground units shouldn't always just explode 
into nothingness. If a unit left a burning shell, it would not only 
look cool, but would slow the enemy advance (they may have to blow up 
burning hulks to clear the way to advance). This might actually open 
the way for tactical retreats, as  your forces block of narrow 
passages, sacrificing themselves to buy you a precious few seconds 
and soforth. Obviously, the wrecks would be fairly easy to destroy. 
It has also been suggested by a few people that you should be able to 
scavenge resources from wrecks.

5) When units get very low on hit points and take a bad hit, they 
should occasionally get a 'critical hit'. Possible effects include: 
loss of one or more weapons, death of pilot, temporary disabling of 
unit and so on.

6) Some units should have smoke shells/generators. Just like a 
portable fog of war! Limits sight in it to a very, very small radius. 
It might be a good ability for human tanks.

7) There should be a way to repair mechanial units.

8) Some unit should have an electro-magnetic pulse weapon that 
disrupts electrical equipment, disabling mechanical units for a time.

9) A lot of postings indicate the Protoss have all kinds of weird 
magic. I think that to stay in keeping with the sci-fi theme the 
psionics should be limited to the more straightforward uses of mental 
power: confusing enemy troops so they don't respond to orders for a 
time, viewing distant areas of the map, mental blasts and so on. No 
fireballs, demon summoning or that kind of thing.

10) Some units should have a ram option. In particular, the scooters 
should be able to sacrafice themselves in a last-ditch ram to stop 
enemy aircraft, and those huge tanks should be able to squish or push 
around smaller units.

11) There should be a bunker or storage building to put units in. It 
would protect them from a surprise air attack, and your enemy 
wouldn't know how good your defences are until he/she/it attacked

12) Some long-range artillery or rocket launcher units should have a 
firing range greater than their sight range. Then they would either 
have to use spotter units, or fire blind. It would be a little more 
realistic, and may reduce the advantages of long range units so they 
don't have to be slowed down to a snail's pace.

13) Ground units should be able to take much more damage that flying 
units. 

14) Units should remain in formation (at least roughly) when moving. 
Faster units should wait for slower ones when appropriate.


COMBAT
------

15) Units with special abilities should be able to use them while 
grouped. An example of this would be being able to have WC2 paladins 
heal in groups, or a group of mages cast a bunch of blizzards.

16) In outer-space zero-G combat, ground units should be useless. 
Without gravity, they would have no traction. A ground unit could not 
move, and would drift off into deep space the first time the fired a 
weapon. Unless these 'space platforms' have artificial gravity, of 
course. Even so, units may be vulnerable to being 'knocked off' the 
platform.

17) Having the combat a little more random would be nice. In WC2, a 
fight is very predictable, with victory usually going to whoever gets 
first hit (assuming all other things equal).  I would like to see a 
little more randomness in starcraft fights. Of course with all sides 
having such different units, it may not matter too much.

18) Why not snaffle the C&C idea and occasionally have a few puny 
ground troops come out of a destroyed building? This might slow down 
an enemy rampaging through your base. 


MAP IDEAS
---------

19) Interactive terrain! Rockslides, boulders you can blow up, swamps 
that slow down units, broken ground that only tracked units can 
cross, bridges you can destroy, shallow water/swamps that those mechs 
can wade through, radioactive areas that damage unprotected units. 
There are hundreds of possibilities!

20) Random events. Somebody posted this a while ago, and if done 
correctly itcould add to the game's lastability since things wouldn't 
be so predictable.Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, dangerous 
critters, etc. Random events couldalso be benificial, perhaps 
changing resources or opening up new building sites.This should 
probably be optional for multiplayer, though.

20) If you do put in satellite weapons (eg C&C Ion cannon) please 
make them fairly weak. I think they would be fine, so long as they 
could really only be used to harass enemy troops during an attack. I 
do not like the idea that someone could hide away in a small, well 
defended base in the corner of the map and blow you away with super-
powerful, unavoidable death weapons. A few people have requested 
super-megadeath kill everything weapons, but I just can't see how 
they would be fun. Oh, it would be fun to totally wipe out your 
enemythat way, but it wouldn't be quite so amusing if it happened to 
you. The whole game would just be a contest to see who gets the mega-
weapon first. That's theproblem with mega-weapons: they are an all or 
nothing item.

22) A random map generator would be nice. State the sort of map you 
want, number of players, difficulty and off you go...

23) The ability to select groups of units on the mini-map could be 
handy if you need to select a bunch units quickly.

24) Should have a good map editor.

25) Bigger maps! Everyone wants this, but no one has really said how 
big. In my opinion, the map should be big enough so that:
a) all players can set up a medium size base without running in to 
each other.
b) the fastest scout unit takes at least a few minutes to explore the 
whole map

MULTI PLAYER IDEAS
------------------

26) Trading with allies. Another popular topic, most people seem to 
like the idea of a supply convoy to take resources to an ally (or a 
neutral force/enemy as a bribe...). Having a shared resource account 
might be a good option to have for some co-op games. The ability to 
give units to an ally may also be a good idea. 

27) It would be nice if your ally could use his/her transports to 
move your troops. 

28) Computer players should be able to be set as proper allies. You 
should also be able to set them to fight each other.

29) More players. I don't mean more humans playing (8 is enough) but 
more teams, say about 12. This would mean you could have 8 humans and 
4 computers in a huge deathmach. Or one human going up against 11 
hostile computers. I only suggest this because in WC 2, you sometimes 
run out of enemies when making co-op puds. (especially with rescue 
players)

30) The random colours should be optional, you should be able to set 
colours if you want. 

31) Some kind of 'handicap' option should be put in so really good 
players can still have a fun game against really bad players. This 
might also be used to even things out if one race is more powerful 
than another.

32) Some kind of disadvantage to betraying an ally would be nice. I 
was thinking that if your ally had given you units, they might switch 
back if you turn off allies or something. (I really hate being 
stabbed in the back.)


GENERAL
-------


33) More upgrading. Always fun. Upgrade missiles to heat-seakers, 
then radar guided, and so on. Cannons to lasers or whatever. 

34) Better scale. It would be nice if units & buildings were on a 
similar scale. Not too important, since it wouldn't hurt gameplay, 
but it would be nice.

35) Longer and better cutscenes. More importantly, cutscenes that are 
relevent to the plot.

36) Enemy units should respond if you click on them. They should say 
'Go Away!' or insult you or something. Oh, ok, maybe not. A bit silly 
I suppose.

37) The AI should protect it's base better than in WC2. It should 
manage resources better, so it doesn't get bankrupted so easily.

38) The game should be flexible enough so the mission/upgrade disks 
should actually add quite a bit to the game. (new units/race etc.)

39) In addition to different strategies, the AI should also have 
different 'personalities' eg: very agressive, defensive, greedy, etc.

40) You should get scoring bonuses for behaving as appropriate for 
yourrace. For example, the Zerg should get extra cruelty points and a 
megamaim gore fest bonus.

41) The different races should have a few resources the same. Both 
the Protoss & Terran could use iron for example. It would be good to 
have conflict over the resources.

42) send maps down link

43) Production queue for barracks and factories. Build X of this, etc.

ZERG
----

44) Organic units should heal over time. With the Zerg could be quite 
fast, but marines and templars should heal very, very slowly.

45) The Zerg should have lethal attack units that look like harmless 
critters.

46) One idea for a Zerg close combat assault unit is some kind of 
beastie who's primary advantage is that he/she/it heals very fast. So 
fast that weak enemies cannot damage it fast enough to actually hurt 
it. It could only be effectively fought by numerous or powerful 
units. If it was melee-only it wouldn't be too powerful, but it would 
be great for picking off enemy scouts and for hit and run raids.

47) Zerg should eat enemy corpses, and possibly critters. Just for 
fun. They should laugh cruely after they do it, too.

48) Acid. A good weapon for Zerg.

49) Poison. Some zerg creature could have a poison sting for killing 
foot troops.

50) Multiple attacks. Some multi-limbed Zerg should be able to engage 
several  foes at once

51) Since Zerg are organic, they should not show up on radar very 
well.

52) Better movement. I think it would make sense if there were Zerg  
'commando' units with fast movement and good climbing ability, so 
they can get into enemy bases through stealth and general sneakyness. 
A sort of huge spider thing would be ideal.

53) A vague thought for a sort of (rather unpleasant) wasp-like Zerg 
that lays eggs in the corpses of fallen enemies. The young hatch out 
in a ready food supply... well, you get the idea. It could be a sort 
of second-line soldier. Not very strong, but produces other units 
independantly. Obviously, the hatchling things would be simple and 
fairly weak combat units.

54) If the Zerg are supposed to win through weight of numbers, a 
great deal of care must be taken with unit design. If (for example) 
you have to repair each unit individually, you would have to spend 
ages fixing up after a battle. This is one reason I think the Zerg 
should heal... You won't have time to get each unit medical 
attention, or whatever. Common, unimportant troops should take care 
of themselves, since the player will not have time to.

55) If this one-hive rumour is true, I would assume that all the 
grubs are laid by a queen Zerg or something similar. I suggest that 
players may build multiple hives, but are restricted to one queen 
(the other hives would be empty, and inactive). They would act as 
decoys, and also if your main hive was badly damaged or destroyed, 
the queen could retreat to another hive. The queen should be slow and 
unarmed, or course.

56) If the Zerg use living units and buildings, why not have guard 
towers that are some kind of alien plant. It could take a while to 
grow after being placed, providing different levels of protection. It 
wouldn't need other units to build or repair it, and it could pretty 
much take care of itself.

57) Being biologically created for war, Zerg units should logically 
be more specialised. After all, it's not a production line or 
anything. Each little bitty bubby Zerg has to grow up, so why not 
specialise? So, why not have a few units that are designed to attack 
the weak points of certain enemy units?Just an idea to add a little 
more variety to the Zerg forces.

58-65) in previous post

66) Since Zerg are organic, and probably do not use metals or 
electronics, they should not show up some sensors properly. Some 
guides missiles probably should not track Zerg.

67) If the Zerg ARE totally evil and violent alien killing machines, 
you should get bonus points for being cruel, bloodthirsty and nasty. 

68) Some Zerg buildings and units should upgrade themselves as they 
'grow'



GENERAL STUFF:
--------------

69) Many people have been posting how they want the computer AI to be 
more flexible. I believe that this is very important, since the 
computer AI is one thing War2 had that no other game has yet matched. 
If the AI in StarCraft can be made even more flexible, it would be a 
great edge on the competition.

I think it is important that the computer AI players can be set to be 
allied with players or each other. The computer should also attack 
computer opponents that it is not allied with. Essentially, the 
computer AI's should be treated as a human opponent.
Being able to set perminent alliances in the map would be another 
good idea.

Furthermore, in addition to different tactics, you should be able to 
set the 'personality' of a computer AI, how aggressive, how loyal to 
it's allies, etc.

That way you might (for example) set a passive AI ally which is very 
loyal, so it would probably send you units/resources quite often, 
rather than attacking itself. 
This sort of customisation would allow much greater variety in the 
maps, and missions.

70) Another thing to consider in this area is that of spectators. 
Many people have said how they would like to have an option to view 
what is happening in the game. This would be quite good, but care 
must be taken to prevent people 'spying' for a friend.

71) An idea I recently had was that you might also want to allow two 
people to control the same team. It would be exactly like a normal 
side, but with two people doing the clicking. Ok, sometimes it might 
wind up with the players getting in each others way, but it would be 
very usefull as a 'tutor mode' to teach people how to play. 

72) People have been complaining about having to set cheats off in 
War2 every time you play, and it occurs to me that you might as well 
save the last setup you used to disk. Then start the setup game 
screen with those values next time.

It's just so when you set a game, the prefs are like that next time. 
The cheats, Fog of war, pud used,  etc should all be remembered. Any 
computer players, or closed slots should also be saved. 
Obviously you can change the prefrences as nomal, but they should 
default to the last values used. It's just that most of the time you 
play similar games and this would make starting a game just a little 
faster.

This has got to be the simplest suggestion ever made. It couldn't 
take more that 5 minutes to add a little save-to-disk feature like 
this, and it would be a nice improvement.

73) Okay, a few people have wanted the Zerg to 'infect' or otherwise 
use enemy corpses. Here is a suggestion for a unit that could do 
this. It's not a new idea, and it's not especially effective or 
revolutionary. It's just a 'cool' unit that would be fun.
It's a defensive unit, who's primary role is protecting the grubs. 
It might even 'attract' grubs: they still wander around, but 'like' 
being near it, and generally won't move too far away. This would mean 
you could have a defense for your grubs, and could 'encourage' them 
to move if you had to (Base under attack, etc)
I kind of picture it looking like a cross between a multi-limbed  
'Alien' and an armour-plated scorpion, but that's just my image.
Now, in addition to other weapons, this units can stab people with 
it's tail, causing them to become impregnated with a little bubby 
grub. In about 20 seconds (whether the unit is still alive or not) 
the grub eats out of the host, and is then just a normal Zerg grub.
This really isn't too powerful, since the unit will probably have 
died in combat by that time, and since it is only a grub that comes 
out, it's of no use in combat. On the other hand, a failed enemy 
attack on your base would mean you might even make a profit!
Probably not one of my best suggestions, but I think it's worth 
putting in. Especially if the Zerg are still a little light on unit 
types.


74) Transfering units would be a very handy ability.
Just make it so you can give units to your ally. It's simple because 
all you need to do is change who the unit belongs to. 
Just this one little ability would mean players could work around 
several problems in the game. You could send aid to an ally in 
trouble, and transfer control of the units so the defence is more co-
ordinated, and you can worry about your own base. If an ally is 
defeated, you could give them units to attack with, so they can still 
play if they wish.
The only problem is that some multi-race combinations might be too 
powerful, but that's going to be a problem if you just had 2 
different races allied. Like in War2, heal and bloodlust worked well 
together...


75) Iolaus recently suggested a system give the players access to map 
co-ordinates.
Anyway, I think the way to do this is with macros:
The command '&#37;co-ord' is the current co-ordinates.
eg: You send the mesage &#34;I need assistance at &#37;co-ord&#34;
Which comes out as &#34;I need assistance at G-14 &#34;
The specified area should also flash on the map, for a second.


Other  macro commands that we might need.

&#37;name: Your name
&#37;co-ords: current co-ordinates (Flash on mini-map)
&#37;enemy: name of selected enemy
&#37;area: current location as a description (Far east, northwest, 
etc)
&#37;resources: list of your current resources
&#37;units: list of current units

Those are a few I can think of. Post any other you think of.


The setting up of a selection of communication macros would really 
speed up the chatting between allies.

You could have &#60;shift&#62; &#60;F#&#62; send a user defineable 
macro. Anyone who has played subspace will be familiar with this. 

So you might have a macro saying &#34;Let's attack &#37;enemy&#34;, 
and set it to F4. Then you select a unit of who you want to attack, 
and send the message by hitting &#60;shift F4&#62;. 

You might set &#34;I am under attack by &#37;enemy&#34; to another 
key.

This way is simple, which is important for StarCraft, but it's also 
flexible, which is always good.

It means you can send a lot of info to an ally with just a quick 
&#60;shift-F#&#62;.

76) I assume Blizzard is not going to have full video before each 
level, and the briefings will be like the ones in War2. Just a voice-
over and scrolly text.

Might I suggest that you change the background picture to something 
related to the mission? If every mission had a different picture for 
background during the briefing, it would look pretty good, and it 
wouldn't be too much artwork.

For example: if a mission was to destroy a Protoss base, the 
background during the briefing could be a picture of that base. You 
might even allow us to set the picture for user level. You could set 
up some units, capture a screen shot and use that.

Also, the cutscenes that are there should be more involved with the 
plot. And in high-resolution, of course.</pre>
