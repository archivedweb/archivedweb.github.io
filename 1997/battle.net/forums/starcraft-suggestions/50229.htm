&#62; ive posted these a few times but not many people seem to reply to it 
&#62; and niether has blizzard which was the goal in the first place
&#62; 
&#62; 1 i think in the map editor you should have the option to have 
&#62; difrent maps if you win or lose so you can make huge campains that 
&#62; way you have real reply ability, you could beat it and you could keep 
&#62; playing it over againgoing down diffrent paths, because first of all 
&#62; you wouldnt want to make a well thought out campain with a great plot 
&#62; behind it, have people play it about once than delete it.  this would 
&#62; make the game more none lenier.  for the lack of anything else to do 
&#62; ill put an example 
&#62; 
&#62;        You have to distroy a terran transport in this level 
&#62;                if you win you get the terrans flight plan and go to  
&#62; the terrans secret base to distroy it 
&#62;                          OR
&#62;                You fail to distroy the transport and you have to go 
&#62; to the same planet but now its a harder level and maybe they have the
&#62; secret wepon they were carrying
&#62; 

There won't be this type of mission branching in the map editor, but, 
if such branches are desired, one could create three separate mission 
strings.  One string could be the initial missions of a campaign, 
while the other two would be the two possible branches.  Depending 
how the initial missions were performed, one of the branches would 
then be played.

&#62; 2 The Zergs have the ability to burrow under ground but cant attack 
&#62; and stuff, i think you should be able to select multiple zergs say in 
&#62; a circle set to a ambush mode and click, that way when the enemy guy 
&#62; goes on the point they pop up and attack him that way your zergs can 
&#62; attack from all sides makeing there weaker but higher number of guys 
&#62; more affective, this also would also make you have small scout partys 
&#62; ahead of the main one to make shur you dont get lured into an ambush 
&#62; makeing the game harder and more entertaining
&#62; 

I'll forward this suggestion.

Pat N.</pre>
