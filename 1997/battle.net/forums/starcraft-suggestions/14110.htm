&#62; Perhaps there might be some part in the game where you would have to 
&#62; build a bridge in order to advance to another part of the game.  But 
&#62; I don't recall seeing any peons. Maybe you could count Thrall as a 
&#62; peon in the start of the game. And anyway you don't just go around 
&#62; building and destroying stuff all the time. 

  I didn't know LOC had some details about it yet.  I thought it 
would be like WC2.  A WC3 you know.

&#62; Lord of the Clans  does NOT have .puds, or anything equivalent to 
&#62; .puds. It does not have a chat screen either. It does not connect by 
&#62; modem. It is not a multiplayer game, can not and should not and will 
&#62; not be a multiplayer Internet game.
&#62; 
&#62; I stand by my position that you have no idea what game you're 
&#62; about. I though you'd go and research up on LOC some more after 
&#62; reading my response but obviousliy you did not.

  What is your problem?  You certinaly have a serious problem.  I 
just thought that LOC was gonna be a WC3, perhaps not.  I never read 
anything that it was not gonna be anything like WC2.  You don't have 
to be (due to the limitation of my vocabulary per the &#34;rules and 
guidelines request, I will have to settle for:) &#34;jerk&#34; about 
the whole thing.  Perhaps I should sit down, browse 100's of sites to 
try to find every possible bit of info about LOC out -- like you, but 
I have better things to do in with my time.  
 
&#62; WARCRAFT ADVENTURES LORD OF THE CLANS IS NOT A REAL TIME STRATEGY 
&#62; GAME LIKE WARCRAFT 2.
  
  How old are you? 12?
 
&#62; Warcraft 3 IS a real-time strategy game that will be coming out some 
&#62; day but has not even been started yet. Its gameplay is based on 
&#62; Warcraft 2 and StarCraft and its storyline continues from that of 
&#62; Lord Of The Clans adventure game.

  Fine, take my orginal post, and replace LOC with WC3 -- if it makes 
you happy.
