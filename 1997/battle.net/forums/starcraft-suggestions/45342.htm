&#62; 
&#62; Im serious, here i am, looking for some GOOD game to wait for 
&#62; starcraft playing, so i heard bout AoE.. so i waste 1 afternoon 
&#62; downloading it (including having to download directX 5.0 afterwards 
&#62; jus to run it) and so, i played it... HA! it has 15 'tribes' 
&#62; supposedly unique, (insane laugh) yer joking! the 'tribes'were 
&#62; identical! only differences are that some can and can't build some 
&#62; nits/buildings! pethetic! and all the game was, was a war2 CLONE! u 
&#62; heard me C-L-O-N-E!!  and it was completely unbalenced! if u had war 
&#62; ships, you can wipe out ANY land units/buildings near shore (keepin 
&#62; in mind, EVERY board has water, stupid, i know) without a doubt.  and 
&#62; the computer always attacks with the same units every time, same 
&#62; ammount to.  And the demo (even though u'd think the size of the demo 
&#62; would not make this # so low) has a unit limit of 50, not even a 
&#62; reasonable limit, i have no idea where the 20 megs outta the 23 megs 
&#62; the file is went, it sure doesn't show.  beleive me, if yer lookin 
&#62; for a GOOD demo, download NetStorm... its a helluva lot better...
&#62; 
&#62;                 &#34;an afternoon of my life, wasted!&#34;

Umm... you're a very limited gamer you know that?  Granted AoE is 
similar to War2 in certain ways, but it's hell of a lot different as 
well.  First of all, the resource system is a whole lot more complex 
and in some ways better.  Certain units, buildings, and upgrades need 
specific resource to accomplish.  With reguard to the warship theory, 
I could wipe the floor with your fleet anyday and I don't even have 
to use ships.  Fleets are not powerful at all, only at sea they are.  
They can only attack so far inland, and in the face of towers and 
catapaults, they crumble like dust.  Hell, even horse archers would 
wipe the floor with them.  Each Tribe is unique.  Go read the AoE.hlp 
file and you'd discover that each race has special abilities.  And 
these abilities are not limited to what units or tech they can 
upgrade.  The reason Unit limit of 50 is there so you'd manage your 
resources and units better.  If the unit limit is an insane amount 
like say... 200, then you'd have a peon war in the beginning.  Every 
player will be building peons and fishing boats and try to gather 
more resources then the other player.  The limit of 50 is there to 
make sure you provide a proper balance between peons and military 
units. 
Tell me, did War2 had nearly as many tech upgrades like AoE?  You can 
research all the techs in AoE, unlike some other players have 
suggested, but it'll take A WHILE.  In war2, the techs and upgrades 
can be all researched and done with half an hour into the game, maybe 
less.  The large number of techs and the cost of them only presents a 
more interesting proposal to the player, &#34;should I get superior 
units or just more of them&#34;.  This at times, determine the 
outcome of games which is something War2 was not about.  War2, 
everyone had the same thing and the same tech, quite predictable 
isn't it?  One last thing, the best feature about AoE was the 
multiplayer options.  You can play Co-op or seperate, that's the most 
amusing part.  Bet you never discovered that either.  In conclusion, 
play the damn game before you insert your amateurish comments or else 
you're just wasting our time.</pre>
