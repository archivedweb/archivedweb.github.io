&#62; Ok Blizzard I have 3 questions
&#62; 
&#62; The first is about battle.net. Can we reserve rooms in battle.net for 
&#62; a certain period of time (like 3 months)? If we can will we be able 
&#62; to certify a list of users that is allowed in? And also if we can 
&#62; reserve rooms will it cost money?

I think that it has been said that guilds/clans/etc. will be able to 
have &#34;chat&#34; rooms like they can on battlenet with Diablo.  I 
doubt that they would object to doing the same with Starcraft...
 
&#62; My second question is: Can you specify who is on whose team before 
&#62; you start the match or will it be like RA where you get in the game 
&#62; and then ally with people?

From what I understand, teams are choosen before the game begins...I 
am not sure if you can still ally with people after action has 
begun...that would only make sense, since you can make and break 
alliances throughout the game...
 
&#62; My last question is: Can teams be all one color or will each person 
&#62; have to be their own seperate color?

From what I understand, Teammates share everything units, buildings, 
and also color.  Allies, on the other hand, will have separate 
colors...
 
&#62; I am asking all of these questions because I am the one holding the 
&#62; Starcraft Tournament where you play on teams of 2 vs. other teams of 
&#62; 2. I really need this information and I would very much appreciate it 
&#62; if you replied to this. Thanks 

Hope the above helped.  BTW I am almost 100&#37; sure about the 
above...
 
&#62; NOTE: All spots are filled in the tournament but if you want to join 
&#62; a team you can sign up at : <a href="http://free.prohosting.com/~blades">http://free.prohosting.com/~blades</a>
