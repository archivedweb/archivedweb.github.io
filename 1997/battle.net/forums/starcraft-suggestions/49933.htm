<pre>Greetings everyone.  For the past three days the Protoss High Council 
has been contemplating the reasons as to why it may be taking so long 
to release the Beta... we have formulated several ideas...

1: With the close approach of the Thanks-giving holiday Blizzard is 
going to be in the Macy's Parade! Yep, it has to be true; they'll 
have Blizzard employies dressed in the Space-Marine suits carrying a 
HUGE Zerg ballon! Willard Scott himself will be dressed as an 
overlord, and the Blizzard-band will be playing track 18 from the WC2 
expansion CD.

2: Or, with Christmas drawing near, they're having difficulties 
getting the Star-craft toys finished.  Who won't want a SCAF? (Star 
Craft Action Figure) Or own some &#34;Canned Creep&#34;?  They'll 
have holographic stickers to attach to the Protoss armor, the Zerg 
will be able to spit water, and the Terrians will have those lighter 
wheels in their backs to make their weapons spark.  I can see it 
now... or maybe they're thinking about &#34;Star-Craft-Cereal&#34;? 
They just can't decide if it will be the Protoss or the Zerg that are 
the marshmellows...

3: Perhaps the departure of AdamM threw the Blizzard Head-quarters 
into Turmoil! That's why there was a problem with the Blizzard Page 
the other day... the employies are streaking through the streets of 
California shouting &#34;I know what you are thinking!&#34;

4:Maybe they are making one of the installation missions in one of 
the Blizzard buildings, and took the opportunity during halloween to 
decorate it, so the digital pictures look correct.  During the 
shooting, they had PatN crawl through one of the heating ducts 
dressed in a large Zerg outfit.. only to discover that the suit got 
stuck! Now with no heat in their computer areas they have to wait 
until enough heat builds up behind Pat to force him out.. meanwhile 
they lifted a Lab-top PC up to him so he can still answer this forum, 
and are feeding him Apple-sauce, and cherry Hi-C through a straw..

Thanx for reading, sorry if it was lame but we are sure it is one of 
these four things....
