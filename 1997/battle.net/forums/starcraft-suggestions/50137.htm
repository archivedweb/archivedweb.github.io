<blockquote>
<pre>1) Is the wormlike unit an Archon?

Quite possible, I have no idea really( although , it did occour to me 
that maybe that unit is a mind controled zurg.)


2) Is the Archon just a glowing High Templar?

I dought it.

3) Is there a difference between the High Templar and normal Templers?

Increased powers I think, I mean they earned the &#34;High&#34; for a 
reason

4) Since the Protoss are supposed to be the strongest race per 
individule unit can a Zealot or a Templar kill an Ultralisk if noe 
are damaged or upgraded?

Hell no! Did you look at the Zealot compared to the Ultralisk? There 
is no way. The templar, If he played it right, just MIGHT be able to 
pull it off.

5) Can you keep upgrading armour and hit power without a limit?

No limit but over time it becomes so expensive that it isn't worth it.

6) Are Protoss buildings shielded?

Yes.

7) What kind of building must be made to keep supporting more units?

Terrians = ?
Protoss = ? 
Zurg = Overminds(transports)


8) Are there any critters in StarCraft?

Yes and they attack too!

9) Since a Siege Tank has to brace itself before firing how long does 
it take to do that exactly?

1.5623 seconds on a pentium 2 266mhz, or in other words, I have no 
idea.

10) How effective are the nuclear bombs the Terrans use?Like in Red 
Alert they didn't do to much at all but in Total Anihalation they 
destroyed every thing in a huge radius which would take out your base 
in one shot.

Not too powerful but still not worthless and you wouldn't like it to 
happen to your base, thats for sure.

11) Is there a cammand for the units so when they recieve X amount of 
damage they will go get repaired like in Dark Reign?

I really Dought it.

12) Is the Archon shielded?

I'd bet yes.

13) How many High Templars does it take to form an Archon?

?

14) Can you mind control a vehicle?

Mind control is probebbly extremely limited so it may not be able to.

15) How long after the release of the full version do you expect an 
expansion?

They don't know when the first ones comming out even!!

16) Do you have to build lurkers is there one lurker per body of 
 creep?

probebbly you have to build them.

17) Does the Carrier have any defense systems other than intercepters?

I'd have to say no but I heard romors of it having a lazer.

18) In WarCraft 2 units occupied squares on the map in StarCraft is 
it set up by pixels so you can stand anywher (in the middle of the 
squares)?

Pixels

19) Do Zerg buildings heal?

I'd say yes.

20) Is there an auto map feature on StarCraft?

Yes, look at the screenshots.

21) Does the Zerg or Protoss have a super weapon since the Terrans 
have the nuclear strike?

Yes, although the spacifis are under wraps.

22) if ther is two Protoss players in a game can one Protoss mind 
control the other?

I'd think so.

23) Is the Archon a good ground unit as in fighting or does it have 
extremely powerful spells?

I'd bet both

24) Is there any defense against a nuclear strike?

Yeah, you can not let the ghost near your base or wipe out the 
enemy's nuke silo.

25) Is an upgrade required the form into an Archon?

?

26) Will StarCraft be released for the Christmas rush?

Who really knows.

27) Can units be seen on the mini map?

yes.

28) Can units hide behind terrain?If so would you see them on the 
mini map?

no, the terrian kind of becomes translucent like in Diablo.

29) Will certain races have advantages and disadvantages during day 
and night?

probebbly not.

30) If day and night affects the races who gets what atvantages?

The Zurg most likely

31) if a zerg is underground can you walk over him or would your unit 
stop or go around then you would know something is there?

I'd have to say yes because chances are they are programed to pop out 
to surprise enemys.

32) If a unit gets attacked and a freindly is beside him but can't 
see the enemy will the freindly come along to help kill the enemy?

I don't really know but if they are fairly close, then yes.

33) Does the ending of the game leave a way to make a sequele or 
expansion to continue the story?

I can bet YES!

35) What times are questions on the forum answered?

I forgot.

36) wher are the proggramers who are making this game located 
City/State?
somewhere in Cal. I don't know the city.


This is what I know</pre>
