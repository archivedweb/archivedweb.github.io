<pre>   Hello!  

  Ok.  About that land transport......

  
     I think (therefore I am?) that there will most likely definetaly 
be some type of land transport.  There are several possible reasons 
(that I can think of) so here they are:

1.  The size of the maps.  We have all been whining about how little 
Warcraft 2 maps were and how big Starcraft maps will be or else... 
And Blizzard is going to make bigger maps.  Because of this, there 
will probably be some kind of troop transport thing.

2.  Already known transports.  We already know that there will be 
spaceships that are meant to bomb installations and/or carry troops.  
The idea of a ground transport unit pretty much goes along with that.

3.  Strategical movements- we have all heard about the real time 
light sourcing, and how units will have headlights and also give off 
heat, right?  I think that it would be much easier to give a little 
truck two headlights than give a huge spaceship thousands of landing 
lights pilot lights shining lights yellow lights green lights purple 
lights little lights BIG lights..you get the idea!  Plus, it would 
add an element to the strategy:  Trying to get close enough to the 
enemy withought being seen or something like that. (while on the 
subject of headlights, and lights in general, I think it would be a 
cool idea if you could turn the lights on and off.  It could be just 
like an attack;walk;patrol button:  every unit you currently have 
selected will turn their lights on, or off.  ALSO, maybe you could be 
revealed to your enemy by engine sounds!  Hear the whine of a scout 
jeep, and as you turn to attack it, the booming of a destroyer doing 
mach-5 for a bombing run on your base.)


  OK!  For the suggestion of the I.B.M.s, I say DON'T!!! NO SUPER 
WEAPONS! I HATE EM I HATE EM I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE EM!!!
  Not having super weapons in War2 is what made it so fun!  It had 
tons more strategy than C&C.  (think of it this way:  Which is 
harder, trying to sneak a lone footman into a base, armed with a 
sword, or trying to sneak a mammoth tank, armed with twin cannons and 
twin missil packs and all that other crap?)  It was alot harder when 
you only had swords and shields and axes, not machine guns and 
rockets, and shells, and napalm!  We use to think that the ballista 
was a godsend!  

  C&C made a terrible mistake using these super weapons.  They 
sucked!  They added nothing to the game!  They required no strategy 
to use! &#34;you planned it so you would launch the nuclear warhead 
the minute your ground troops broke the outer defenses and&#34; 
bullshit!  To make matters even worse, C&C didn't even get the 
weapons right!  A nuclear warhead can level miles of terrain, brown 
out neighboring cities, and cause cancer for miles and miles, etc.  
In C&C, that technological wonder/horror did 500 hit points of damage 
in a 9x9 square. What fantastic military strenghts we have these 
days, my my my! :)

  I would like to see units that are very strong and capable and 
cool, but not these tesla coils and mammoth tanks and all this other 
stuff. It totally rules out the chance of strategy on everyone's 
part.  That is all I have to say right now, haha.  


  Please post replies/comments


UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLY YOU HAPPY NOW GENERAL JAMES? :)</pre>
