&#62; &#62; All the supposed good ideas Blizzard has come up with has already 
&#62; &#62; been used in recent RTS. An excellent example is Age of Empires. Why 
&#62; &#62; settle for 3 races with SC when you can have 12 with AOE. Not to 
&#62; &#62; mention the 9 upgrades with SC and 100+ upgrades with AOE.
&#62; &#62; There is the issue of multiplayer games, being able to have 2 people 
&#62; &#62; with one race, free multiplayer intrenet site, neutrals, etc.
&#62; &#62; Why wait 3months or more when you could buy a RTS that has everything 
&#62; &#62; NOW? Blizzard has taken too long with this game and Blizzard is 
&#62; &#62; basically a date late and dollar short (as the saying goes) 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I think there is a subtle difference between AOE and Starcraft type 
&#62; of games. AOE is more like Master of Orion while Starcraft is more 
&#62; like a true Strategy (gather resources, build units, attack) type of 
&#62; game. I don't think it would make sense to have 12 races because the 
&#62; game would become humongous (and not to mention the fact that 12 
&#62; story lines (for each race) would mean about five CD's of movies, 
&#62; etc.)...

Blizzard I my oppinen is the best game company out there every game 
they make is a hit microsoft cant say that neither can westwood or 
very many companes can starcraft has 3 DIFFIERNT races with there 
pros and cons AOE has 12 races that are ALMOST EXACTALY the same. AOE 
has good graphics and gathering food is kinda cool but it gets old. 
and they try to and a manegement of NONwar things. Yes that would be 
cool but they did a crab job of it I mean reaserching better Armor at 
a storige pit? the gaurd towers at the market place? It just you 
basic RTS game with a few bells and whisles. Starcraft on the other 
hand has fresh ideas (moveing buildings Zerg growth stages  elc.) 
good graphics and as fars as AI we dont know but AOE AT and RA's are 
not any thing speicle. So starcraft will I think be the best game to 
date and the only game that comes close will be WAR2 (AOE TA and RA 
In my mind Only beat WAR2 in Graghics and other hardward advansies 
made in the past 2 years)
