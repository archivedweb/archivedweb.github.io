<pre>One Flew Over the Nydus Pit
A tragety by dWARDEN
The Scene: A tastefully decorated psychologists office.
The Players: Doctor Martin, David, John, William, Nancy, and Cruddy.

(The scene begins with the players sitting in a circle. Dr. Martin's 
back is to the audience)

Dr. Martin: I'm so glad you could all make it. Does anyone know where 
Chris is?

David: He won't leave his computer. He's waiting for the StarCraft 
Beta announcement. He hasn't slept for 5 days.

Dr. Martin: And that's just the type of behavior we are trying to 
correct today. John, can you tell me why you're here?

John: I...I'm obsessed with StarCraft.

Dr. Martin: And how does this effect the quality of your life?

John: I can't think of anything else. My relationships with people 
are deteriorating. My friends won't go out with me anymore.

Dr. Martin: Why not?

John: I bring my lap-top everywhere. I won't go to places that don't 
have an analog line. I spend every spare minute on the StarCraft 
forum. I was arrested trying to install a phone-line in at my church.

Dr. Martin: Good. You have identified your problem That's half the 
battle. Now...

John: (interrupting) Dr. Martin? Do you have a phone line in here?

Dr Martin: (angrily) No! Now. William. I see you've brought your 
lovely wife, Nancy. It's nice to see such support from a family 
member.

Nancy: Doctor! You've got to help him!

Dr. Martin: Shhhh. Calm down. William can only help himself. What 
seems to be the problem this week, William?

William: Nancy and I disagree on what to name the new baby. She 
want's to call her Alicia.

Dr. Martin: And what would you like to call her?

William: I want to call her...AdamM

(Everyone one but Dr. Martin and Nancy begin to wail. John breaks out 
in tears and forms a fetal position in his chair.)

Dr. Martin: I know that we are all very sad at AdamM's departure. But 
we have to move on. Why, just yesterday, David confided in me that he 
made a major breakthrough. Would you like to share that with us, 
David?

David: Uh, I'd rather not in front of everybody.

Dr. Martin: Now come, think of how inspirational it will be.

David: (Very nervous) Ok. I, uh... I played Age of Empires lat week!

(There is murmuring in the room. John holds his head in his hands.)

John: Don't say that game outloud!

Dr. Martin: Please! Please! Everyone! We must all respect each other. 
David, you told me something else about this, remember?

David: Yes, and I...I REALLY LIKED IT!

(The room explodes. Cruddy leaps from his chair and is at David's 
throat. John begins searching the room for a phone jack. PatN enters 
the room and wrestles Cruddy off of David and levels Cruddy with a 
roundhouse. Cruddy is dragged out in a straitjacket)

PatN: (whispering as he leaves the room) I've wanted to do that for a 
long time...

Dr. Martin: Well! I'm sure you can all see where your obsession can 
lead you! No David, I know this is hard, but, please continue. John 
get back here and sit down!

David: Well, AOE is pretty cool. It has these cute little animals. 
Elephants, birds, lions, gazelle...

William: (interrupting) Antelope. I think they are antelope.

(There is a unified gasp in the room)

David: You've played AOE to, William?

William: (sobbing) Yes! Yes! I was going insane! I mean, I ORDERED 
STARCRAFT FROM CHIPS & BITS BACK IN JUNE!

(David and William embrace)

Dr. Martin: I think we've made a breakthrough here. Now, everyone. 
Keep taking those prescription beta blockers...

John: Don't say &#34;beta&#34;!	

The End</pre>
