&#62; An adventure game from Blizzard? Point and click adventure. Boring!!! 
&#62; For the many of us RTS fans who enjoy Blizzard games, how many of us 
&#62; do you expect would go out and buy a crappy adventure game? Adventure 
&#62; games and RPGs don't last long. Once you finish an adventuer game 
&#62; once, it would be put away for good and no one would ever touch it 
&#62; again. Adventure games don't have replayability or multiplayer 
&#62; support so who the hell would bother? Once you've finished it, if you 
&#62; were to ever play it again, you would already know exactly what to 
&#62; do. No fun, no thinking required. I wish Blizzard would cancel their 
&#62; work on Warcraft Adventures and use their valuable time (which they 
&#62; are currently wasting on Warcraft Adventures) to make new and better 
&#62; games (e.g. Warcraft III) or finish off some games (e.g. Starcraft). 
&#62; I mean what is the point of making WA, apart from the storyline 
&#62; linking to War3? Who would buy it? Apart from those idiots out there 
&#62; who think WA IS Warcraft 3.
&#62; 
&#62; I know this is not the place to talk about this, but since I've 
&#62; started, who cares. Diablo 2? What happened to diablo 1 better not 
&#62; happen to diablo 2. Please tell the Diablo team (I dont want to waste 
&#62; a message posting the diablo forum then waiting another 2 hours to 
&#62; post again) to make Diablo 2 TOTALLY bug and cheat free. That means 
&#62; no duping or hacks. Have more options to fight the lag too. Have a 
&#62; menu option when launching a game so there is a maximum ping 
&#62; requirement. For example, you can set max ping: 700 so that no one 
&#62; with higher ping than 700 can join. I finished diablo in single 
&#62; player the day after I got it. I played over battle.net and with 
&#62; others, experienced all the cheaters and laggers and pkers. Killed 
&#62; diablo 20 times. Got bored of it within a month and never played it 
&#62; again. How short lived. If I had a wish, I'd wish Blizzard would skip 
&#62; Diablo 2 and warcraft adventures.


ahh... diablo 2?  i think you mean diablo's expansion, Hellfire.
if so, then go talk to sierra, because they're the ones making it.</pre>
