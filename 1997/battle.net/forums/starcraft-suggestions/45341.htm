<pre>  Forumers,

  Well, over at the TA forum, they've got a guy by the named of 
Dataman, who offers this advice on how to 'edit' TA units to your 
liking:

   I figured out how to change the parameters for all the units in 
TA. I'm working on a program to do this a lot easier as well as
    an actual FAQ... I wanted to get this info out so others
    can begin work on some editors):

    - The files to work with are the *.ufo files (the unit
    files)

    - Know what the current values are for each unit (I use
    the Unit Viewer for an easy reference for most
    variables)

    - You can figure out which .ufo file is which unit by
    the name of the file: Armbrtha.ufo is the Arm's Big
    Bertha for example.

    - Use these formulas to figure out the values in the
    .ufo file:
    Cost Energy: (value/4)+255 = result - value = X
    Cost Metal: (value/3)+255 = result - value = Y
    Time: (value/2)+255 = result - value = Z

    (some units:)
    Max Velocity: (value*4)= result - value = A
    Max Acceleration: same
    Turn Rate: same

    Yes, you will get negative numbers.

    - Take each result from above (X,Y,Z,A) and search for
    their DECIMAL (float) value in the proper .ufo file.
    When you find the location, note it for that unit (I'm
    working on a complete list of offsets) and now you can
    change the values (remember to do the opposite with the
    formulas to check the value).

    This has worked wonders in a multiplayer map where I set
    the Big Bertha to be only 1 Energy, 1 Metal and 1 Cost.
    I had 30 of them pounding my enemy!!!
    (there are actually good uses for this method of
    changing units...)

    Also, I'm trying to figure out how to name your own
    units... I think I might be a few days from that.

    In the future: Weapons and the rest of the parameters.

    It literally took me over 60 hours to figure this out...
    a lot of trial and error. I recommend you backup your
    files BEFORE messing with anything!! (unless you don't
    mind reinstalling)

    Works great in having a Big Birtha cost 1 energy, 1
    metal and 1 time...:) (yes, works in multiplay)

  He also says elsewhere that the .ufo files are loaded with the unit 
viewer, and that the ufo files are to be put in the Main Directory of 
the game on your Hard Drive-- that's the only place it'll work.

  I do not OWN Total Annihilation, so I don't know if this'll work, 
but anyone here who does, please try it and let us know if it does.

  I guess if it does work, Cavedog is going to have to scramble to 
write a patch to stop it. It's kinda funny...I remember some TAer 
going off on how Diablo was so easy to hack :)
