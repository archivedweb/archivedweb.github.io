<pre>ive posted these a few times but not many people seem to reply to it 
and niether has blizzard which was the goal in the first place

1 i think in the map editor you should have the option to have 
difrent maps if you win or lose so you can make huge campains that 
way you have real reply ability, you could beat it and you could keep 
playing it over againgoing down diffrent paths, because first of all 
you wouldnt want to make a well thought out campain with a great plot 
behind it, have people play it about once than delete it.  this would 
make the game more none lenier.  for the lack of anything else to do 
ill put an example 

       You have to distroy a terran transport in this level 
               if you win you get the terrans flight plan and go to  
the terrans secret base to distroy it 
                         OR
               You fail to distroy the transport and you have to go 
to the same planet but now its a harder level and maybe they have the
secret wepon they were carrying

2 The Zergs have the ability to burrow under ground but cant attack 
and stuff, i think you should be able to select multiple zergs say in 
a circle set to a ambush mode and click, that way when the enemy guy 
goes on the point they pop up and attack him that way your zergs can 
attack from all sides makeing there weaker but higher number of guys 
more affective, this also would also make you have small scout partys 
ahead of the main one to make shur you dont get lured into an ambush 
makeing the game harder and more entertaining

PS please dont mind my spelling im a crappy speller and i know please 
dont waist your replys complaining about my spelling waist them 
coplementing my ideas and adding your ideas for my ideas to my ideas.</pre>
