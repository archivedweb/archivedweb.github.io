<pre>Um I am just wondering if the units will be bitmaped or true 3D 
rendered because form the screen shots it dosen't look like it.  This 
, I think, would be a great improvment if you don't already have it, 
the 3D rendered that is.  I would gladly wait until next year to have 
this done and maby some others I will mention later.  I think you 
should have multiple units (like Atleast 30) for each race.  I know 
this is hard but I found in TA (Total Annihalation, i think that how 
you spell it) that with 75 different unit to build it gave it more a 
stratigic feel and also made it funner, I thought.  Also 3D terrain 
adds more of realizm to the game and i know this is hard and takes 
time but, hey i can wait, I hope ;).  Water units are also cool and 
adds more units and stragety to the game.  Right now it looks like a 
pretty awsome game and i would like it definatly and play it a lot 
but there are some of those things that would make it even better so 
that is would be the ultimate stragety game ever, like the things i 
have mentioned above:).  Well I think that it for now and Comments 
form everyone, especially Blizzard, of course.  More to come probably 
as I think of them :).
