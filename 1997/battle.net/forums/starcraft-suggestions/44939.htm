&#62;        Ok here's the scoop.  In the game from Activision called Dark 
&#62; Reign an interesting feature is included.  here it is:
&#62;         
&#62;        You are sick and tired or following your builders around 
&#62; making sure that they make the most possible buildings as soon as 
&#62; possible in the beginning of the game.  With this feature you can 
&#62; click on a building then another building and the builder will build 
&#62; the buildings consecutively without waiting for another command.  
&#62;      EXAMPLE FROM WARCRAFT II:
&#62; 
&#62;        You just started a multiplayer game and you dont have to 
&#62; follow your peons around.  You simply click on a building and the 
&#62; place where it should be built.  So you start building your barracks 
&#62; and you decide to plan ahead and choose more buildings in the order 
&#62; you prefer and place them where you want.  (The area where you will 
&#62; build buildings could be shaded in so that you know you cant build 
&#62; buildings there)  So instead of following your peons around you have 
&#62; planned ahead and thus able to get to more important matters such as 
&#62; defending that grunt rush, and talking with your allie, or sending 
&#62; insults to the enemy.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;      DONT THINK I AM AN IDIOT!!
&#62;  
&#62;      Do not think that i am stupid and that I think this is the only 
&#62; way to go.  To tell you the truth i am not sure.  Planning ahead does 
&#62; take out a little skill that is needed to follow your peons around 
&#62; and thus if you are faster then your opponent you could gain a lead.  
&#62; I simply wrote this to allow Blizzard (if they like the idea) to 
&#62; choose if this option would benefit the game or not.  Personally i 
&#62; like the idea but i think it best to make it an option.  However, 
&#62; that could impose a problem with making the computer AI.  Well see 
&#62; how you like the idea Blilzzard.  PLEASE RESPOND! i posted earlier 
&#62; and noone ever responded.

&#62; Dagger (ACG),
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;The anticipation of fear
&#62;   is sometimes greater 
&#62;   than fear itself.&#34;

Good idea.</pre>
