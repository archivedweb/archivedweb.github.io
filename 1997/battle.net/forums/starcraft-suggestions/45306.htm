<pre>You people make me wanna laugh I've got both a PC and a MAC and when 
it comes to number crunching and graphics applications nothing beats 
the MAC, at work we've also got MACs and PCs we've recently aquired a 
200mhz MAC and a PC we put them to a test, the test consisted of a 
100mb Photoshop image and to do a 10 pixel blur on the image the MAC 
came out ahead almost by a full minute. Now where software is 
concerned YES the PC has allot more software than the MAC but then 
how many applications out there would anyone buy trully buy or are 
worthy of buying I say about 1500 that I would whip my wallet for and 
these include games, the MAC at last count from APPLE had about 1200 
applications that were PPC compatible, that is compatible to take 
full effect of the RISC archictecture that APPLE employs in all of 
it's MACs including laptops. Back to games yes I can't play Diablo on 
my MAC yet but that will change but I won't care I bought it when it 
first came out and played it on my PC. Ho and for that person who 
said that MACs where behind the times check what architecture Pentium 
chips are using definetely not RISC if they were there would have to 
be a major rewriting of all the code in Windows NT and 95 to take 
full advantage of the chip otherwise you might end up with something 
worse than what you began with, take for example APPLE again when 
they released they're RISC MACs the MAC OS at the time was not 
optimized to take full advantage of the processor so at the time some 
of the faster 040 chips were actually faster than the RISC ones but 
as later updates to the MAC OS became available the computers began 
to fly and leave there predecessors behind the MACs full pontential 
is still not seen in OS8 they've still got legacy code from the 
original MAC OS from 84 but then it shows how versatile the original 
code was, so hence I believe that INTEL wants to produce a RISC chip 
but is being persuaded not to because even MICROSOFT does not have 
time to reproduce all they're code for WINDOWS to take full advantage 
of the chip. APPLE decided to take the RISC plunge because it's part 
of the future of computing SUN SPARC's and SGI's run on RISC why 
should'nt the home computer OH YEAH the DEC ALPHA is also a RISC 
chip. There's a place for all the OS's of this world I use the MAC at 
work because I have to it's an easier machine to setup and work with, 
but if I wanted to play solely to play video games I would probably 
buy a PC.
One final thing I'm reminded of when issues like this occur 
Coacroaches are more populus than human beings but hence greater 
numbers do not make for a higher lifeform.
