&#62; 27)  Air Craft Carriers.  These would be like flying transports for 

&#62; ships.  I don't think that the Dropships could hold like wraiths and 

&#62; stuff, so this would help by holding a bunch of ships.  Not like th 

&#62; protoss carrie, this could hold any kind of flying ships.



Why?



&#62; 28) Repairs.  There should be some building that could take in and 

&#62; repair your troops and units.  This would be like the heal spell

&#62;  but only accessable by the building.  Or a medic station.



Good idea.



&#62; 29) Catacombs.  Zerg should have Catacombs where they could hatch in 

&#62; large numbers, this would be like having multiple barracks in one 

&#62; building.  With like 10 spots select one and tell it to grow a 

&#62; certain unit.  This would help the hording.



Cool. This thng would take like 5 times as long to build as a normal 
barracks. I think all units come out of a single hive in the form of 
grubs. Maybe you could have a special building where you actually 
mate the grubs though- that could be pretty big.



&#62; 30) Space travel.  In space you shouldn't stop when you end the 

&#62; command because in space you don't do that.  So a ship would stay on 

&#62; its present course and you would have to curve back and attack again. 

&#62;  This would add a sense of reality.



This really sucks. It would make air battles unplayable. Of course 
you can stop in space. Simply reverse thrust until you match 
velocities with a reference frame. If they can make spaceships that 
can travel at super-light speeds to beyond the edge of the galaxy, 
surely they can give them brakes... But the game won't have air units 
take off full speedfrom a dead stop and then halt dead in thir 
tracks, or pull an instant 180. There will be realistic acceleration, 
deceleration, and banked turns, but the units will always come to a 
stop right where you tell them to. The way it should be.



&#62; 31) Inerplanetary Travel.  There should be some way to travel to 

&#62; another planet in the same map.  You could start outon a planet and 

&#62; grow then go into space and find a new planet.  You should just go up 

&#62; from your current potions and be in space and be able to go back into 

&#62; the aptmosphere.



How many maps in one map then? (Let's play hide-and seek!) That could 
suck.



&#62; 32) Battle.net Books.  There should be some feature on B.net that 

&#62; lets you make books that indenify your friends and foes.  This would 

&#62; be cool and have an auto sereach for them.



Books?





&#62; 33) Mega beam.  the protoss should use their psionic powers to build 

&#62; a mega Beam.  This ouwld be a building and it would have great power. 

&#62;  It would be needed to built on a hill top so the range could be 

&#62; increased.  This would give the Protoss a good thing to balance out.



Heheheh. I love mega beams. But it shouldn't be like an ICBM missile. 
Just swivel it around and vaporize single troops one by one at a 
distance.



&#62; 34) Space Stations.  You should be able to construct space stations 

&#62; or mybe battle space station.  Like the death star.  That would be 

&#62; cool.  They would be very expensive, I mean 50000 gold (SC terms) so 

&#62; you could just build one for nothing.  This would be armed with guns 

&#62; and it would have the building that produces ships efect and the 

&#62; effect of barracks.



Well, the &#34;space platform&#34; scenarios are essentially space 
stations... I posted an idea earlier about having mobile dreadnought 
battle cruisers, but you wouldn't just pay a flat sum and build one. 
You'd make it bigger and stronger throuought the game by essentially 
building other units and buildings &#34;into&#34; it.



&#62; 35) Satilite Strike.  You should be able to build a station on the 

&#62; ground that contacts a satilite launched into space by you and the 

&#62; satilite could target a spot.  You would coose he spot on he mini map 

&#62; and then it would strike.



I kind of like this idea. Did I mention this one earlier too? It 
would work kind of like sappers. The bitch of it is that it would be 
like invisible sappers, which were not possible for good reason. It 
might be too much of a cheap tactic and it would have to be made too 
expensive to be practical. Good bluffing and intimidation potential 
though. (Maybe I have 10 satellites over your town, maybe I don't. 
Wanna test me?)



&#62; 36) Weather effects.  The weather would be random abd would be light 

&#62; or harsh waether.  Maybe if you would be on a planet with lava then 

&#62; maybe a crack would bust and magma would come poring out.  It add a 

&#62; non player hazard, which War2 didn't have.



...



&#62; 37) Online maps.  before the start of each game the person that 

&#62; created it could choose the map seting.  Like theterrain or if it was 

&#62; dead space and then it would set it up and through the players to 

&#62; there staring spots.



Isn't that already in Warcraft 2? Which suggests it would be in 
StarCraft...?



&#62; 38) Map chooser.  i think there should be a random map chooser but 

&#62; like it makes up the map complately and throughs together a bunch of 

&#62; ground and stuff.  It would an X amount of already made maps and it 

&#62; would pick from one of them.  This way you would have a real map and 

&#62; a playable map, but not the same one everytime.

&#62; 

Uh... What? Do you want to randomly pick one of the built-in maps, or 
randomly generate a map? Or both? I have no idea what you just said.</pre>
