&#62; hey, i called a store and they have the release date saying nov 26.
&#62; u relive what would happen if they missed chritmas? i personally 
&#62; would buy it anyway since i have a hold on it, but if it misses 
&#62; chritmas the sales would drop greatly, that is why they probably 
&#62; pushed back the sept 1 deadline.

&#62; &#62; Blizzard has said it dozens of times.  I've said it dozens of times

&#62; &#62; HAVE A RELEASE DATE YET.  NEVER HAS.  Don't listen to anyone but 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Many people complain about Blizzard's choice of not giving a release 
&#62; &#62; date.  EVERYONE does this.  The almighty Microsoft even does this.  
&#62; &#62; Apogee/3D Realms does the same (Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior were going 
&#62; &#62; to be released 'when it was ready'.)  Blizzard made that mistake 
&#62; &#62; once... giving a release date that they were unable to meet.  They 
&#62; &#62; will not do it again.  They prefer for people to be frustrated and 
&#62; &#62; not know, and to have their game and them be happy, rather than say 
&#62; &#62; &#34;It will be ready on XX date&#34;, failing to meet the deadline, 
&#62; &#62; and people whining and complaining... &#34;You said it was going to 
&#62; &#62; be released!  You liars!  You suck!&#34;  Geez people... chill out 
&#62; &#62; and wait.  If Blizzard has proven anything, it's that their games are 
&#62; &#62; worth the wait.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Once more for those hard of hearing (or seeing, I guess. :) ) THERE 
&#62; &#62; IS NO SPECIFIC RELEASE DATE.  It is naive for anyone to think that 
&#62; &#62; another company like EB would know the release date before Blizard. ;)

&#62; &#62; &#62; but it I found it at their web site. www.ebworld.com If anyone has 
&#62; &#62; &#62; further information post away.
