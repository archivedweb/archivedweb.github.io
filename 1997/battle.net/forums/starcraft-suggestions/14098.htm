&#62; From the hundreds of maps I created in your excellent game, Warcraft 
&#62; II, I found a few little problems that kept bugging me. I really 
&#62; enjoy working with AI allies, and not just by myself. I can do this, 
&#62; as U know, By turning AI players to RESCUE(ACTIVE). But, Although the 
&#62; Cpu does work with me in that case, it doesn`t work with other rescue 
&#62; actives and they just beat each other up till death instead of the 
&#62; enemy. I can almost solve this by putting them in different sides of 
&#62; the map, but the rescues have an annoying habit of coming to the 
&#62; player`s camp and only then searching for enemy Ai`s. Furthermore, 
&#62; the &#34;sea attack&#34; Ai`s empty their mines completely before 
&#62; they ever go seafering, and that can take...well, up to and including 
&#62; the defeat of all enemy Ai`s. Therefore, if it`s not too late 
&#62; already, There is nothing I would appreciate more in starcraft map 
&#62; editor then an &#34;Ally&#34; option in Ai`s setting, in a way that 
&#62; all allied ai`s will work together with the player, and 
&#62; independently(from their base, not coming to the player base first) 
&#62; against enemy AI`s. Furthermore, I hope U noticed that custom Ai`s 
&#62; tend to build farms which block their way to their mines and then get 
&#62; stuck and stop developing, effectively eliminating them from the 
&#62; competition. I hope U will read this and/or consider my polite and 
&#62; humble request. Thanks in advance and congratulations on creating 
&#62; such a great list of superb games.

I completely agree with you. I had the exact problem. I wanted 
multiple allies but they all beat each other up. But it is kinda fun 
to make 7 rescue actives then watch them have a royal rumble/free for 
all. But still, I agree with you. Having the ability to make multiple 
allies in a map is a must.</pre>
