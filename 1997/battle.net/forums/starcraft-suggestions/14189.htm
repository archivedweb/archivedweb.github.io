&#62; This if course would be instantly cleared up by looking at the host 
&#62; from whence the post came.  Even you should have been able to figure 
&#62; that out by now Iolaus.  Perhaps I over-estimated you intelligence...
&#62; ******************************************

	BREEP! Wrong answer! The REAL Ugly the Cute has posted and stated 
that his brother used his computer and his name. Looking at the host 
name wouldn't have helped. Perhaps you over-estimated your own 
intelligence in your haste to attack me? You silly guy, you.




&#62; &#62;   You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
&#62; &#62; Somms has 
&#62; &#62; --made Krowa leave the forum
&#62; ****************************
&#62; I would think this would be a plus Iolaus... you two have something 
&#62; going on that the Forum doesn't know about?
&#62; ****************************

	STILL into the Homosexuality? C'mon Somms, stop dreaming about me. 
Even if I was gay, you wouldn't have a chance with me. :)
	
 

&#62; &#62; --stated that Alchemy's mother does sailors for five bucks a pop
&#62; ****************************
&#62; Ok! Ok! I am sorry!  It was 3 bucks.  Can't a person make a mistake?!
&#62; Jeez...
&#62; ****************************

  Sure. And he can make a ass out of himself, too. Congratulations, 
Mr.Buttocks. 




&#62; &#62; --called Drunk Master Chan a motherf***er
&#62; ****************************
&#62; This is wrong actually.  I called him a motherf*cker.  The other two 
&#62; asteriks are silent.
&#62; *****************************
 	
  Ok, ok, you're right. You know a lot more about motherf***ing than 
anybody else. 




&#62; &#62; --has had his posts vaped several times by Bliz Support and laughed 
&#62; &#62; about it
&#62; *****************************
&#62; This is true somewhat.
&#62; *****************************

	This is true a lot.



 
&#62; &#62; --insulted many people for no other reason than he doesn't like their 
suggestions
&#62; *****************************
&#62; Iolaus--your wrong again.  It really wasn't their suggestions that 
&#62; bugged me inasmuch as their existence.  So far your1 for 5.  That's 
&#62; pretty lousy.  I hope you never play for the Sonics.
&#62; *****************************


  I'm dead on and the Sonics suck. Like you, they are mentally 
fragile and choke when the heat is on.



    
&#62; &#62;   If this is what you want to defend, you're welcome to it. The guy 
is an ass, and everyone knows it. People insult him with good reason. 
&#62; &#62; He insults you in his reply and you say &#34;Well put.&#34; You sound 
&#62; &#62; like an Ugly imitator, or at least, somewhat strange.
&#62; ******************************
&#62; Iolaus you have stooped too low.  You are kicking this kid when he is 
 down in front of the whole goddamn forum.  Let me be the bad-@ss--
&#62; your not very good at it.  Why don't you go back to being that smarmy 
little goody-two-shoes guy I came to know and abuse?  It seemed 
&#62; people liked you more then.  And after all that's all you really care 
about isn't it?
&#62; *******************************

	I guess if I had no friends and forced my presence upon those who 
didn't want me around I might say something like that. Or I might 
shoot myself before it got quite that bad.



 
&#62; &#62;   Like I said, the guy seems somewhat disturbed. It happens on the 
&#62; &#62; Internet. At the least, he is very immature, his actions prove it. He 
has never apologized for his lame crap, unless you count a weak one 
&#62; &#62; to Alchemy after he totally crossed the line. 
&#62; *******************************
&#62; That wasn't an apology.  I actually felt sorry for the guy.  I mean 
&#62; really..sheep AND sailors?  That's and awful thing for Alchemy to 
&#62; find out about his mother...
&#62; ******************************


	Does this sort of thing impress people at your home? Because it sure 
doesn't impress anyone around here.


 
&#62; He's nice for ONE post 
&#62; &#62; and you want to make nicey nice with him? I dunno Ugly, I think his 
fear of banning is talking. 
&#62; *****************************
&#62; Iolaus get this through your gushy-granola-eating-pot-smoking-animal- 
loving-pie-in-the-sky-every-thing's-hunky-dory-won't-you-be-my- 
neighbor thick skull...
&#62; I don't care if:
&#62;     -Support tries to ban me or not.
&#62;     -People like me or not.
&#62;     -I am forgiven for my cyber-transgressions.
&#62; While these may be life and death matters to you they are not of much 
concern to me.
&#62; ****************************

  Gee, I bet you're all kinds of fun at cocktail parties. Does anyone 
invite you to theirs anymore? Guess not. Okay then, is the 'cool 
loner' thing working for you then? Oops. You sound bitter. Guess not.


 
&#62; Or maybe you're right, contrary to his 
&#62; &#62; post, he wants to be friendly. Awww, how CUTE Somms. You sensitive 
&#62; &#62; guy, you.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   All I can say, whoever you are, is that Somms has made his own bed. 
Just because he is too pathetic to get the clue that no one wants him 
around doesn't mean we have to be nice to him. I'll leave him alone 
if he stops flaming people for making suggestions. 
&#62; *********************************
&#62; Translation: I am freaking scared of SOMMS and the way he embarrases 
&#62; me in front of everybody all the time and if he wants to quit that's 
&#62; sure fine by me!!!
&#62; Sorry Iolaus this will not happen.
&#62; *********************************

	Aw, c'mon Somms, you know better than that. I consistently give 
better than I take with you. But if you want to become part of the 
Forum and make Suggestions like everyone else, I can live with that. 
I really do want you to become part of the 'mediocre chattel', as you 
call it. That's already happening. 


 
&#62; Blizzard can take 
&#62; &#62; care of his really awful stuff with vapes like they've been doing.
&#62; &#62;    I'll hold my nose and tolerate Somms presence on the forum 
&#62; &#62; because, after all, the guy has no life and isn't going to go 
&#62; &#62; anywhere. 
&#62; ********************************
&#62; That's pretty big-headed talk coming from some loser taking beginning 
C programming courses from dumpy Foothills Community College 
&#62; nestled in smoggy Los Altos California.  Tell me Ioluas...did 
&#62; Professor Berry flunk you or did you have to do alot of EXTRA-CREDIT 
&#62; to get by? 
&#62; ********************************


	Wow, you did RESEARCH to find out about Foothill College? I'm 
flattered. I really am. Sorry sommy-boy, but the Silicon Valley rules 
high-tech, and at $9/unit for good courses, so does Foothill.
    Sayy, you're not going to start STALKING me, now are you? That 
would be kind of weird.


 
&#62; It's kind of sad. Indeed, I think it'll be really cool to 
&#62; &#62; make him into a nice enough guy, which is where he's headed if all 
&#62; &#62; his posts continue to be like the last one.
&#62; *******************************
&#62; Translation:  I hope he'll be my pal 'cause I'm tired of him kickin' 
&#62; my @ss!
&#62; *******************************


	You don't get it. Your hard flames get vaped. Your lighter flames no 
one cares about anymore because you've ridden that horse to death, 
and I can have fun with you at will on those. :)
   The only thing that you can say on the Forum that anyone will much 
care about are your Starcraft Suggestions. You are already becoming 
one of us. And, more or less, a nicer guy. Sorry Satan-boy.


 
&#62;  But he's kind of immature 
&#62; &#62; too, so we'll have to remind him of his attitude problem from time to 
time. You know how kids are.  :)
&#62; &#62;  					    __Iolaus__ 
&#62; *******************
&#62; Beautiful ending Iolaus.  Did you wright that all by yourself or did 
&#62; you have to get Mr. Rogers to fly all the way out to Silicon Valley 
&#62; to help you?.

	Yes, I did 'wright' it all by myself. Did you learn to spell all by 
yourself, or did you have spelling blocks to help you?  
 


&#62;    If you have to pick on Ugly the Cute to help fuel your stupid lame 
@ss war with me you are a bigger waste of skin than I originally 
&#62; thought you were.  In the future direct your comments at me instead 
&#62; of focusing them at defenseless individuals that may frequent this 
&#62; forum.  This is cowardly and shameful and won't be tolerated.  It 
&#62; really illustrates, Iolaus, how weak you really are.
&#62;                                               --SOMMS


  Sommy-boy, as you know by know, it wasn't the Real Ugly the Cute. I 
was smart enough to figure that out, and you weren't. And I really 
don't think we're in a war. You want to be a bad-boy, and I make fun 
of you. It's really pretty harmless stuff, overall. I'm sorry if you 
think I'm weak, but you're silly and conceited enough to think that 
you're superior to everyone else, so your credibility as a judge of 
character is in extreme doubt. I'll consider the source.
