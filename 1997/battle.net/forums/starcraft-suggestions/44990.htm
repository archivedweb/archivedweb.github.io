&#62;  Hey! Does anyone know if Starcraft won the RTS poll over at 
&#62; meccaworld.com? Acid reported in close to midnight that SC was ahead 
&#62; of TA 2380 to 2360 (pretty damn whoop-ass for a game not even out yet 
&#62; to beat one that is! =) but if you go to meccaworld, it doesn't seem 
&#62; to list the final poll results for that poll. And I don't know WHO 
&#62; the guy is lower on the page who says TA won 1500 to 500-- last time 
&#62; I checked, SC had over 1000 votes, and I went to bed early...
&#62; 
&#62;

On the main page it said that TA crushed the competition, but that SC 
and DR pulled out plenty of votes.  I was there when we passed TA, 
but quickly saw somebody coming to Cavedog's aid.  (No fair, one 
ballot box stuffer at a time :)  We had about 2400 (a little less) 
when I went to bed.  I don't know how TA would have &#34;crushed&#34; 
SC, but apparently Meccaworld thinks it did.

Note to J(MiB):  I didn't intend to force my will on anyone and 
demand that they buy SC with no thought of even looking at TA.  
&#34;Let's whoop those TA'ers!&#34; does have a joking tone to it... 
as for me saying that we should &#34;beat the crap out of those 
TA'ers&#34;, I wasn't really serious.  I don't think physical threats 
work well on gaming forums/polls.  From now on, everyone should take 
everything I say as a joke unless otherwise specified. (This is not a 
joke :)
