<pre>I did not play AOE. Not because it was Microsoft but because I had 
other things to do. (Hear about million dollars a day..heh heh) But 
IF there were infinite upgrades how many do you really think you 
would use before it was completely useless. E.G. I make 50 upgraded. 
My opponent made 9. Probably past nine it is not so much an upgrade 
and +.0005 to a stat. My units are not that much more powerful. But 
one on one they would win. (We are both Protoss)However my opponent 
has 50 more units then I do. (Say we both have 100 units.) He is 
oging to win. So instead of having game balance all out of whack 
Blizard just left it at 9 upgrades. (In each technology mind you) Now 
if YOU think you are going to upgrade all 9 in every technology, well 
congrads. You will not have many units. I think I willl stop at 4 and 
then concentrate on units. Then when that is comfortable I will 
continue with upgraded. That is all I can say for now and when the 
game comes out I might change my strategy. But for now, that is my 
paln.

&#62; Having read the most recent uberlist I read that tech has only 9 
&#62; upgrades. I think the ability to be able to upgrade forever adds the 
&#62; quality of infinate replay for a game. Examples of best selling games 
&#62; with infinate upgrades are Civilization and Master Or Orion. I still 
&#62; love those games because there is always something you havn't done in 
&#62; the game.
&#62; I would also like to ask if the game is driven only by the idea of 
&#62; destroying your enemy. If the game isn't goin to have infinate 
&#62; upgrades have other ways of winning the game without the same old RTS 
&#62; idea of killing the bad guys. Something along the lines of 
&#62; Microsoft's Age of Empires.</pre>
