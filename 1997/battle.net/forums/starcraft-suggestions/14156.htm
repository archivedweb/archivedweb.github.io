&#62; I recently heard that you were planing on allies having the same town 
&#62; hall/units. Please don't do this! this would virtualy eliminate any 
&#62; chance of backstabbing (an art i practiced in war2) and also 
&#62; diplomacy. 
&#62; 
&#62; Perhaps a better way would be to have both sharing units (select from 
&#62; the start) and individual playing (when two players can ally and 
&#62; fight againts a common foe, though seperately.) This would be 
&#62; selected from the start screen, for example:
&#62;           Sharing?
&#62; Player 1     +
&#62; Player 2     +
&#62; Player 3
&#62; Player 4
&#62; Player 5     +
&#62; 
&#62; Landscape:???
&#62; Game:Allies (or individual)
&#62; pud:*.pud
&#62;      
&#62; 
&#62; This would allow serious feuds (such as clan wars) to be based around 
&#62; two or three colors, while the game creator would still have the 
&#62; option of playing a traditional war2 game (where players could ally, 
&#62; backstab, truce etc..)
&#62; 
&#62; Please take this into consideration, because this could seriously 
&#62; kill a game that i have been anticipating for 1-2 years.

Unlike what u think it says in all magazines that u can choose to 
start as teams before you even start the game (allies for the whole 
game)and this gives u options of sharing resources units......OR you 
can allie in the progress of the game and this alliance would be like 
a alliance in wc2 or red alert(good for backstabing) you would still 
be able to trade resources and units with your allie and share but 
not to share as much things as you could in team play!!!!</pre>
