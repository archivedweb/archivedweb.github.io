<pre>Is it just me or does the forum seem to be regressing back to an ad 
page for the clans/leagues.  It's the Starcraft SUGGESTION forum, not 
the advertise for stupid clans forum.  Anyway, now that that's out of 
the way, here are my questions:

Q:In the map editor, how will you go about setting different 
attributes/mission objectives for different players/species.  Let's 
say for instance, a small Terran group has to keep alive a general, 
and the Zerg have to KILL the general.  Would you set it up for the 
terrans 1st and then (if setting how much of map is visible is 
possible) you push a button and you are switched to the Zerg 
viewpoint to set that up?

A:

Q:You seem to be hinting about trees being able to be burned/shot 
down.  Is this possible?  I think it would be pretty cool if a group 
of Terrans were trying to attack a group of Protoss so they had 
firebats burn down area between.

A:

Q:In one of the Uberlists (the last one?) you said that team play 
would share color, and ALL units and ALL buildings.  I don't think 
this is a good idea, because teammates would get really mad if they 
want a unit to go one way but their teammate takes him another way.  
You should have different shades of the same color so that you can 
tell units apart.

A:

Q:Will there be any way to have two tilesets on one map, say, some of 
it is dirt, while other parts are metal platforms?

A:

That's all I can think of right now.  Thanx for your time! </pre>
