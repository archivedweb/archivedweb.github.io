&#62; Q:will there be multiple unit building in starcraft. for example make 
&#62; so yo can choose to build 5 units. once one unit is built it starts 
&#62; building another one. You could also choose to put it on hold like in 
&#62; command and conquer.
&#62;

It is possible to build more than one unit at the same time (though 
you will need more than one worker unit to do this).  Or, instead of 
making two or three buildings concurrently, you can command all of 
your workers to help construct a single building, finishing it more 
quickly.
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:whatt if an zerg unit has both a ranged+hand to hand attack. Can 
&#62; you choose which one to use.
&#62; 
&#62; 

I'll see what I can find out about this one.


&#62; Q:what will the unit &#34;commanding&#34;-will it be like command and 
&#62; conquer. Or warcraft 2.
&#62;

I'm not sure I understand this one.  Can you restate it in another 
post for me?
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:do larvae require resources to produce.
&#62;

Nope.
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:will damage affects a unit or structures preformance.
&#62; 

Not in its actual performance stats, though the player might change 
his strategies concerning a unit if it is heavily damaged (like have 
it stay in the back :).


&#62; 
&#62; Q:will there be more than one plane in installation missions.(as in 
&#62; levels). Will there be staircases and elevators.
&#62;

I'll see about this one.  It is possible however to string together 
multiple installations missions, and each of these would have its own 
&#34;plane&#34;

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:how does one air unit attack another. do you have to select the 
&#62; enemy's unit.
&#62;

You don't always have to select an enemy unit if you want it 
attacked.  Patrolling units will attack nearby enemies, and your 
units will defend themselves if they are attacked.
 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:will you be able to edit a weapons variables.(range,speed,rate of 
&#62; fire, damage done per hit etc).
&#62;

You can edit a unit's stats, and have it start a game with certain 
upgrades in the map editor.  This isn't actually editing a weapon, 
but results in a similar effect.


&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:it seems that all zerg units ,even the drone have some form of 
&#62; weapon. will buildings be like that to. will a seemingly defense 
&#62; building  be able to protect itself.
&#62;

Some buildings will be able to defend themselves, yes.
 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:will the terran be able to build multiple bases.
&#62; 

Sure can!

&#62; 
&#62; Q:can scv build buildings. if so will there be no building that you 
&#62; to construct things.
&#62;

SCV's build all the basic Terran structures, though SCV's do not 
build units (is this what you mean?).
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:what do all those icons mean in the lower right of all the 
&#62; scrennshots(the skull,hypodermic neadle etc...
&#62; 

Those are icons representing different unit commands.  Commands can 
be given to units by clicking on these icons, or by hitting the 
appropriate hot key (though default commands can also be given using 
the right mouse button).
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:what special things can heros do.
&#62;

... ;)

 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:do protoss units cost more ,or do they take more time to build. or 
&#62; both.
&#62;

In general, Protoss units take more resources to produce, though some 
units take more than others.
 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:will there be defensive structures like turrets,pillboxes,etc
&#62; 

Maybe :)

 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:how does an ghost's psionic ability help him/her. can he do stuff 
&#62; like the high templar.
&#62;

No, you won't find a Ghost going toe-to-toe in a mental struggle with 
a Templar.  Ghosts have some nasty tricks, though...
 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:will the death sequences be different if you different weapons. 
&#62; will the marine die differently if he is scaleded with enzymes.
&#62;

This is a definite possibility, but we'll have to wait and see.
 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Q:whats the square root of 100,000,000
&#62; 

Four.  Wait...that's not right.  Four is the number of times I banged 
my head on the keyboard trying to figure this one out!
