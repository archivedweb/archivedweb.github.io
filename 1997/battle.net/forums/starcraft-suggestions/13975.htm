<pre>I have read that when you upgrade a terran building and then move 
that building the upgrades stay where they are.  Then if another 
lucky terran player comes along and settles down he can use those 
upgrades on his own buildings.  Cool idea.  But isn't it a little 
unfair to protoss and zerg players?  I was wondering if you could let 
them use it, maybe in strange ways.  One idea for the zerg is to let 
them simply eat the upgrades to grow stronger faster.  An idea I had 
for the protoss is an ability human clairvoyants are sometimes 
purported to have.  Apparently they can touch something and tell 
exactly where the owner/last person to have touched it is.  Since the 
protoss have psionic(psychic?) powers how about letting the protoss 
player touch the upgrade and then have the current position of the 
terran building revealed?  This would be very cool, especially if the 
protoss player has the terran player on the run(he could track him 
down wherever he goes:).
At the least could you allow the zergs/protoss to at least easily 
destroy all the upgrades so that the terrans won't have them again if 
they come back.  Pls provide some feedback on how u feel about the 
idea.

By the way thanks for letting up a little on that heavy veil of 
secrecy blizzard:)  Maybe you could give us a rundown on the races 
and each  of their abilities sometimes?</pre>
