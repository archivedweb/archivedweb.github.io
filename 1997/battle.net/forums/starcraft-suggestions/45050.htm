<pre>An adventure game from Blizzard? Point and click adventure. Boring!!! 
For the many of us RTS fans who enjoy Blizzard games, how many of us 
do you expect would go out and buy a crappy adventure game? Adventure 
games and RPGs don't last long. Once you finish an adventuer game 
once, it would be put away for good and no one would ever touch it 
again. Adventure games don't have replayability or multiplayer 
support so who the hell would bother? Once you've finished it, if you 
were to ever play it again, you would already know exactly what to 
do. No fun, no thinking required. I wish Blizzard would cancel their 
work on Warcraft Adventures and use their valuable time (which they 
are currently wasting on Warcraft Adventures) to make new and better 
games (e.g. Warcraft III) or finish off some games (e.g. Starcraft). 
I mean what is the point of making WA, apart from the storyline 
linking to War3? Who would buy it? Apart from those idiots out there 
who think WA IS Warcraft 3.

I know this is not the place to talk about this, but since I've 
started, who cares. Diablo 2? What happened to diablo 1 better not 
happen to diablo 2. Please tell the Diablo team (I dont want to waste 
a message posting the diablo forum then waiting another 2 hours to 
post again) to make Diablo 2 TOTALLY bug and cheat free. That means 
no duping or hacks. Have more options to fight the lag too. Have a 
menu option when launching a game so there is a maximum ping 
requirement. For example, you can set max ping: 700 so that no one 
with higher ping than 700 can join. I finished diablo in single 
player the day after I got it. I played over battle.net and with 
others, experienced all the cheaters and laggers and pkers. Killed 
diablo 20 times. Got bored of it within a month and never played it 
again. How short lived. If I had a wish, I'd wish Blizzard would skip 
Diablo 2 and warcraft adventures.</pre>
