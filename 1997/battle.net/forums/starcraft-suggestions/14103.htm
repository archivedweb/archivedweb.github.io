<pre>We already know some info on the Map editor; that it will have better 
AI control and scenario layout. I've also heard a lot of talk of 
adding the ability to make &#34;custom units.&#34;   I think that 
might overcomplicate the editor and delay the release. So, here's my 
idea. Make a full-featuredmap editor and then after the game comes 
out make a unit editor seperately. 



The unit editor would be basically graphical. You'd have a big screen 
of all the units and buildings- you could click a button to cycle 
through Terran, Zerg, Protoss, and NPCs/critters/items/scenery. 
Double-clicking on any of them would open a window with all the 
unit's animations displayed at the top, and below a huge array of 
buttons and menus. This would let you change all possible aspects 
that define a unit: can it move, how fast, can it carry other units, 
can it attack, does it fly, what attacks does it use, how powerful 
are the attacks, how frequent can it attack, what are its special 
abilities, and on and on and on. For the graphics you could cycle 
through the frames and paste in one frame at a time. (You would need 
a lot of frames to create a whole new unit graphic.)  You could then 
install the changes in a .pud file.

These abilities would make this a serious tool for editors who have 
real artistic ability

pg    :) 

and some knowledge of gameplay balance.



In order for this to work, just making and ordinary map should give a 
&#34;clean&#34; message in the game screen, making a map and 
modifying some upgrade properties will give a &#34;modifed&#34; 
message, and major reworking of the units will give a &#34;super-
hacked&#34; message.



This would allow purists who don't want any crap to play on the 
standard maps; but also let the more adventurous try something crazy 
just for fun. It would have to be a matter of honor not to make a 
lame cheating .pud and lie about it to get people to play you. But if 
you choose  to play someone with a tweaked .pud, you're accepting 
that chance.



This is a truly sick 2-player modified Warcraft 2 .pud of my own 
creation. Use at own risk...  : }
