&#62; &#62;    FROM: Suk on Taks (well, Ok, maybe it's Iolaus... ;)  
&#62; &#62;      TO: All you Puny Forumers, worshipping a rip-off game...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;    I would just like to say, that Starcraft is definitely a RIP-OFF 
&#62; &#62; of EVERYTHING in the KNOWN UNIVERSE!!! The conspiracy goes WAAAAY 
&#62; &#62; beyond 'Starship Troopers' and 'Warhammer 40K'... I mean, I 
&#62; &#62; mean...TERRANS, Ok, TERRANS comes from the word 'Terra', which means 
&#62; &#62; 'Earth', and what planet are we living on people?!? You just THINK 
&#62; &#62; about it, you'll see what I mean...and, oh yeah, PROTOSS, that's just 
&#62; &#62; SO original...I mean, like we don't ALL watch NFL FOOTBALL GAMES five 
&#62; &#62; months a year...you see Brett Favre or Aikman or Young drop back to 
&#62; &#62; pass, and he's a Professional football player who's what, What, WHAT 
&#62; &#62; (I can't hear u!!!)-- he's TOSSING THE BALL! So pro + toss= PROTOSS! 
&#62; &#62; I mean, Bliz, just give it up, you un-original twits!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   AND yep, the ZERG, they STOLE THE ZERG TOO! I mean, we ALL saw 'Toy 
&#62; &#62; Story', and like, they used the word 'Zurg' and even though we never 
&#62; &#62; SAW a Zerg in Toy Story or even got told WHAT they were, well, all-
&#62; &#62; righty then, you know, YOU JUST KNOW that Pixar and Steve Jobs had a 
&#62; &#62; concept in MIND for them, just in CASE, and that Blizzard's 
&#62; &#62; TELEPATHIC SPIES read Jobs' mind and STOLE ALL OF TOY STORY'S IDEAS 
&#62; &#62; FOR THE ZERG!!!!!! (sad sad sad... I am so ashamed of you Blizzard)...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   And oh yeah, Starcraft being a COMPUTER GAME! Yeah, like DOOM 
&#62; &#62; wasn't a COMPUTER GAME, or QUAKE, or SPACE INVADERS.. and it comes on 
&#62; &#62; a CD-ROM...how MANY COMPANIES have you stolen THAT idea from, 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard! You just SUCK! And it's for Win95 and Macintosh, tell me 
&#62; &#62; THAT'S original, why can't you come up with a BRAND-NEW OS to port it 
&#62; &#62; to, can u answer that, no, didn't think so, and my GOD, you REALLY 
&#62; &#62; think OTHER COMPANIES didn't have WEBSITES before Blizzard, well, 
&#62; &#62; that's just too low, stealing that idea too... and...and.. also and 
&#62; &#62; furthermore....
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;     *BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!* (Su Tak's head explodes from the 
&#62; &#62; outrage and unfairness of it all.....)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Later that evening...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Iolaus: No officer, I have NO idea how it happened...he said he was 
&#62; &#62; just going to post something on the Suggestions Forum, and 10 minutes 
&#62; &#62; later I go in there and there's brains all over the walls...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;     &#34;All great thinkers stand on the shoulders of those who've 
&#62; &#62; come before...&#34;
&#62; &#62;                       __Iolaus__
&#62; &#62;   
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; you are so stupid, oh no they stole the idea of a computer game and 
&#62; making a web site
&#62; guess what they also stole the idea of have a game name and a 
&#62; companyname
&#62; they stole the word blizzard
&#62; and the word star
&#62; and craft
&#62; oh no what will we ever do
&#62; oh no now heres a goodone they stole the idea of having people 
&#62; program it, oh no they are just
&#62; thiefers arn't they, what will we ever do,
&#62; you are just dumb, sorry what did you say your dumb that what i 
&#62; thought i heard you say
&#62; Quote &#34;Death to you and all your saviors&#34;


What?!?!?  Cant you see that was just a joke and supposed to be 
funny?  I thought it was a pretty good imitation of some of the 
people that come to this forum.  If you thought he was being serious, 
you must be the real dumbass.  Blade, dont flame somone because of 
you own stupidity.  You'll just embarass yourself.</pre>
