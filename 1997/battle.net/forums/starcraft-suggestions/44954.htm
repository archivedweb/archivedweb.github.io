<pre>Hey Blizzard,
I just want to say thanks for not listening to every idiot who comes 
along and complains about the release date, telling you to release 
the game as is right now. I appreciate it that you actually take the 
time to make the game, instead of making Warcraft in space.(Not that 
Warcraft sucked, it would just feel weird in a space atmosphere.) 
Anyway, I say, hold out longer. Hopefully all the whiny little idiots 
will never show up on battle.net, those who go around trying to look 
like a badass, like those playing Diablo... besides, it teaches 
people patience. In any case, the whiner's comments aren't valid, 
because there are so many consumers who have no idea what's going on 
in the first place, so when they finally see the game in a store 
they'll buy it if they want it. Maybe it won't have as much business 
in the beginning for you, but let's face it, if these are the people 
who were so god damned dedicated in the beginning, then turn out they 
quit because they can't wait, then when the game comes out and it's 
good they won't resist and will buy it anyway, because they have no 
will power. Sad to see some people with their god-damned clans. This 
is really getting dumb. &#34;the oldest starcraft clan on&#34; hey 
what's wrong with you guys? The game hasn't come out yet and you 
think you're prestigous because you have the oldest clan out there. 
Don't worry, your clans will either die fast, or have absolutely no 
merit. Maybe there will be one that stounds out, there always is, but 
the rest of you are lambs for the slaughter. As a last messege to you 
impatient consumers, Blizzard has left their mark with their games 
already. If you think they won't again with Starcraft, your an idiot. 
For once a company does something right and most people are too 
stupid to realize it... oh well... 
Rob</pre>
