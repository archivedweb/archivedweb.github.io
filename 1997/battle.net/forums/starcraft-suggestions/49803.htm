&#62;     I would just love to go into a game and watch. 
&#62; This is a concept i was kinda hopin you guys would come
&#62; up with. I heard of it somewhere.
&#62;     If this does happen, does that mean i can just go 
&#62; and watch any game i want to? Or do you have to set it up
&#62; when the game is started? And, of course, there can be an 
&#62; option to turn off the ability for people to watch the game.
&#62; But like in a ladder game, that would be almost the best 
&#62; thing to do if you wanted to make sure that the truth is
&#62; known about a game. 
&#62;     And you could add a feature that disables talking during 
&#62; a game or enabling it, whatever. Most likely, if this does 
&#62; happen, people will always disable this option because who
&#62; knows who is watchin. 
&#62;     And of course, some questions for ya:
&#62;     1/ Are there any units that can repair or heal other units?
&#62; 
&#62;     2/ If so, could a unit's kills add a small addition of 
&#62; damage the unit inflicts?
&#62;     3/ How many ships can a cloaking ship make cloaked? And
&#62; can they cloak land units, too?
&#62;     4/ Do camoflauged zergs still have the same range of sight
&#62; below the surface?
&#62;     5/ Can underground zerg patrol or at least attack an upcoming
&#62; threat and then be told to go underground when you first give them 
&#62; the command to borrow. Like waypoints. so that means that the zerg 
&#62; will be under ground, then something comes by, the zerg kills it,
&#62; then goes back underground and regenerates or whatever to its
&#62; next victom comes to meet its doom. This would work better if there
&#62; was a lot more underground zerg units and a variety of them.
&#62;     6/ Allies can cloak another ally of a different race right?
&#62; Like in war2, you could make anything invisible i think.
&#62;     7/ I have a more influensive way to make people construct more
&#62; 'farm'like buildings. The more 'grown', the more healthy each unit 
&#62; gets. Like a hurt unit will eventually get better with the more
&#62; 'grown'. It heals faster as more is grown.
&#62;     8/ What the hell do broodlings do? I guess they help protect
&#62; the queen or whatever that produces them with corrosive spit or 
&#62; something.hehe
&#62;     9/ Do drones fly or crawl? Does it decrease the size the creep
&#62; takes up when a drone is transformed into a building? 
&#62;    10/ That would be nice to have a number of creep supplies someone
&#62; has to use for making buildings. 
&#62; 
&#62;    I liked what that one person said about programming units. Heres
&#62; a scenario in war2 you could use i guess.
&#62;     1) Ogres around the enemy camp lust up.
&#62;     2) Deathnights decay for 30 mana on each tower.
&#62;     3) 3 ogres rush in to attack peons gettin gold.
&#62;     4) 6 ogres from the same spot hit the defenders as they run
&#62;        after the first 3 ogres
&#62;     5) From the other side of the camp, all ogres rush in to 
&#62;        destroy in order: the blacksmith, the ogre mound, then any 
&#62;        barracks near to those buildings
&#62;     6) While destroying the town have fliers scout for any possible
&#62;        units trying to escape.
&#62;     7) Have ogres around any expansions with barracks to lust up and 
&#62;        start patrolling in case of reinforcements from other enemies
&#62;        tryin to save the expansions that the person has left.
&#62;     8) After the ogres stop fighting at the demolished base, have 
&#62;        like 3/4 go back to your most valuable base to await a 
&#62;        couterattack.
&#62;    Now if your allies do the same thing, then you just have to say 
&#62; when. Then POW, game over. Because, most likely the teams are even.
&#62; you could even have it so that in a sea level you could have trans-
&#62; ports full of sappers come in and get rid of their junk as you are 
&#62; fighting their jugs or something. Of course who would go to the 
&#62; trouble to set this up. I guess they could do it after a failed 
&#62; attack by an opponent who is trying to rebuild an army. 
&#62;     This is kinda long isnt it? I just wanted to use my two posts
&#62; an hour thoroughly. And i think i acheived that a while ago. 
&#62; Blizzard, if you could, answer some of these questions.Please.
&#62; 
&#62;     - Who really cares who i am? if you want to know, then reply
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. I would rather you worry about gettin the game out asap 
&#62;      instead of reading these suggestions. Even mine. If you
&#62;      are even checkin this thing anymore! hehe :&#62;
