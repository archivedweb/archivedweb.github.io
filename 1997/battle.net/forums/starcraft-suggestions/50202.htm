<pre>Okay, here's a better look at it becuase not everything
has to be done linearly.

Blizzard announces the beta Monday.  They said
&#34;about a week in advance&#34;.  So let's figure the sign-up
is over the weekend.  Monday ( seven days later ) they
send out the 1000 cd's that they already had pressed
while we waited ( or during the 'about a week' pause )
for the beta-signup.  It will take about a week for everyone
to get their CD and start testing.   Figure the test will
last two weeks.  We are at four weeks now.

Here's the deal.  When they send off the beta CD to be
mastered they can ALSO send of the main CD to be
mastered and then release necessary patches through
battle.net.  StarCraft could be on shelves in about 4
weeks minimum.  That's 28 days and leaves 20 days for
us to do our shopping. :)

Quoth the Raven, &#34;NEVERMORE!&#34;

&#62; Almost right down to the wire Blizzard! Can they make it? Lets run 
&#62; some numbers. (NOTE: these are all guesses depending upon what we 
&#62; already know about how the beta will work)
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, so if the Beta was announced today, Blizzard said the real signup 
&#62; would take place a week later. Lets take off 7 days. (41 Days left.) 
&#62; Suppose the signup lasts 3 days. Then they mailed the Cd's to the 
&#62; lucky ones. This will take a total of I'd have to say 8 days min. (33 
&#62; days left.) Now thats just to get the cd's to the players. The beta 
&#62; should last about 3 days at least I'd have to say. Then there is a 
&#62; weeks work on stuff uncovered in the beta. (Now we're down to 23 
&#62; days.) Now lets just throw in an extra week, just to give Blizzard 
&#62; extra time, after all they probably won't announce the beta today. 
&#62; (16 day's left) 
&#62; 
&#62; Hummm, ne1 have an idea how long it takes to get the cd's to the 
&#62; printing shop and back, all nice and boxed and ready to go? Lets give 
&#62; Blizzard another week. (9 Days left) 
&#62; 
&#62; So, now we're down to 9 days, looks like to me We're all going to 
&#62; have to do some late Christmas shopping, to get this game in time.
&#62; 
&#62; Post your opinions / number work, please.

&#62; I have got to get a life :) Between my own daily Game programming

&#62; else :)</pre>
