<pre>     OK!  This is in reply to a kind of old message, posted either 
last saturday or friday, by someone claming to be ME!  It was not ME! 
 Here is what happened:


     I took a trip to Florida for about a week, with some friends of 
mine and other people.  My younger (and stupider :) ) brother stayed 
home, because, well, he IS stupid.  He logged onto my computer, and 
onto the internet using my login and password.  THEN, the smart-ass 
went to the Starcraft suggestions forum, and procceded to right that 
pathetic message!  When I came home, he showed me it and the replie 
from SOMMS.  He thought it was funny!  I was barely keeping myself 
from kicking his a$$, when I saw what he had replied with. &#34;Very 
well done, or something.&#34;  VERY WELL DONE!?!?!?!?  WHAT IS THIS, 
A STEAK?!?!  So i did kick his ass.  And I apologize to anyone that 
would ever believe, for one second, that I have any sympathy for 
poor, adolescent SOMMS.  Thanks.

                                         Ugly the Cute


If you are wondering, here is the message and replies to which I am 
referring.  Read them, and understand :)

&#62; &#62;    Lately I have been away from this forum (because of a server 
&#62; &#62; problem and I have gotten back into the game Subspace [if anyone 
&#62; &#62; cares, my screen name is ssaamm in subspace, look me up or something, 
&#62; &#62; haha]) and when I came back, I was repulsed by what I saw.  After 
&#62; &#62; scanning through the messages, I saw one from SOMMS (no, don't hit 
&#62; &#62; your back button!  I am not flaming SOMMS :) ) and then a reply from 
&#62; &#62; Iolaus.  The bulk of SOMMS message was reassuring Pyran Firebrand 
&#62; &#62; that Lord of the Clans won't interfere with Starcraft.  It was a very 
&#62; &#62; polite, courteous reply, utilizing no bad language or grammar :)  
&#62; &#62; THEN,, I read the reply from Iolaus, and was absolutely MOTIVATED to 
&#62; &#62; write this.  Iolaus replied by saying &#34;finally trying to act 
&#62; &#62; civilized, eh?  Not cussing or making your-momma jokes, trying to act 
&#62; &#62; mature&#34; (NO, this is not completely accurate, but a fair 
&#62; &#62; representation :) ) 
&#62; &#62;     How PATHETIC!!  You people flaming SOMMS for everything he does 
&#62; &#62; are PITIFUL!  The guy is trying to apologize, trying to be civil, and 
&#62; &#62; you ASSHOLES are going to go off on him like a bunch of idiots!  
&#62; &#62; Everytime SOMMS rights something, someone replies with &#34;SOMMS 
&#62; &#62; sucks, or SOMMS is gay, or SOMMS is an asshole (Blizzard will 
&#62; &#62; probably vape me for my language, haha)&#34;  And then you have the 
&#62; &#62; AUDACITY to call SOMMS IMMATURE?!?!  If you insult him, you think he 
&#62; &#62; will keep being friendly, or start being friendly?  He will go back 
&#62; &#62; to cussing and fighting like he used to do!  He tries to be friendly, 
&#62; &#62; and we just keep insulting him, keep enraging him, and then when he 
&#62; &#62; finally blows up we say &#34;SEE? what did i tell you? SOMMS is 
&#62; &#62; pathetic.&#34;    Correct me if I'm wrong (can't wait to see the 
&#62; &#62; replies for that one!), but we are the pathetic ones.  Kicking him 
&#62; &#62; when he's down.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      That is about all I have to say, I would welcome any criticism 
&#62; &#62; or complaints or fights against me, I probably sound like I am 
&#62; &#62; whining, too.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; &#62;                                                Ugly the Cute
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 	Ugly (assuming you really ARE Ugly the Cute, and not an imitator)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;   You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
&#62; Somms has
&#62; 
&#62; --made Krowa leave the forum
&#62; --stated that Alchemy's mother does sailors for five bucks a pop
&#62; --called Drunk Master Chan a motherf***er
&#62; --has had his posts vaped several times by Bliz Support and laughed 
&#62; about it
&#62; --insulted many people for no other reason than he doesn't like their 
&#62; suggestion
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;   If this is what you want to defend, you're welcome to it. The guy 
&#62; is an ass, and everyone knows it. People insult him with good reason. 
&#62; He insults you in his reply and you say &#34;Well put.&#34; You sound 
&#62; like an Ugly imitator, or at least, somewhat strange.
&#62; 
&#62;   Like I said, the guy seems somewhat disturbed. It happens on the 
&#62; Internet. At the least, he is very immature, his actions prove it. He 
&#62; has never apologized for his lame crap, unless you count a weak one 
&#62; to Alchemy after he totally crossed the line. He's nice for ONE post 
&#62; and you want to make nicey nice with him? I dunno Ugly, I think his 
&#62; fear of banning is talking. Or maybe you're right, contrary to his 
&#62; post, he wants to be friendly. Awww, how CUTE Somms. You sensitive 
&#62; guy, you.
&#62; 
&#62;   All I can say, whoever you are, is that Somms has made his own bed. 
&#62; Just because he is too pathetic to get the clue that no one wants him 
&#62; around doesn't mean we have to be nice to him. I'll leave him alone 
&#62; if he stops flaming people for making suggestions. Blizzard can take 
&#62; care of his really awful stuff with vapes like they've been doing.
&#62;    I'll hold my nose and tolerate Somms presence on the forum 
&#62; because, after all, the guy has no life and isn't going to go 
&#62; anywhere. It's kind of sad. Indeed, I think it'll be really cool to 
&#62; make him into a nice enough guy, which is where he's headed if all 
&#62; his posts continue to be like the last one. But he's kind of immature 
&#62; too, so we'll have to remind him of his attitude problem from time to 
&#62; time. You know how kids are.  :)
