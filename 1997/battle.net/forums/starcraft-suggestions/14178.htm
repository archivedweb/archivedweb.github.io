&#62; As any TRUE strategist knows,
&#62;       For defeating an enemy of the same size or somewhat greater, 
&#62; the trick is to position your forces to which they can attack at full 
&#62; strength and numbers, while the enemy is forced to deal with a 
&#62; greater force wherever he chooses to attack or defend.  
&#62; 
&#62; How is this strategy accomplished?  Not by simple selections and 
&#62; movements... It is done with formations and synchronized attack.  
&#62; Synchronized attacking and formations are very similar in that they 
&#62; both deal with the individual speed of the units in the situation.
&#62; 
&#62;     This has been the problem with RTSs ever since the beginning. -
&#62; The RTS engines of today, have not been powerful enough to support 
&#62; cohesive tactical maneuvers of formations and synchronized action.  
&#62; 
&#62; Never could you get your tanks to slow down and stay with the 
&#62; infantry.
&#62; Never could you get your knights to escort the catapults.
&#62; Never could your archers march in formation behind footmen.
&#62; 
&#62; AND, In order for a player to have a combined attack, with different 
&#62; types of units, all attack at the same time, he had to do minute 
&#62; calculations and all the while, his opponent was growing stronger.
&#62; When all the combat groups (control 1,2,3, ect..) had been formed, 
&#62; and everybody was in place, and it was time to &#34;move out&#34;  
&#62; GUESS WHAT HAPPENED!  They all got mixed with the other combat 
&#62; groups.... forming the, oh so common, mass of writhing, dying, 
&#62; unorganized mob of pixelated soldiers.  Pathetic?  I said it... 
&#62; 
&#62; Don't talk to me about a &#34;formations&#34; option, 'cause I know 
&#62; why it won't work.  Just why it didn't work in C&C/RA and why it 
&#62; won't work in the upcoming MYTH...  Has anyone checked out Bungies 
&#62; page on Myth? 
&#62; Get this, it says this above various screen shots....  &#34;Look at 
&#62; the various formations you will have to master.&#34;  That's a bunch 
&#62; of crap, because the soldiers in Myth are BITMAPPED...  They are 
&#62; sprites, therefore having set walking speeds to fit their sprites 
&#62; graphics. (Anyone want to try and counter this, go ahead 'cause I 
&#62; have proof)
&#62; 
&#62; CAN anyone tell me how one is to form a useful formation of combined 
&#62; types with soldiers who can only move at different speeds?
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Well, The formations reform when all the units stop.&#34; -I.E. 
&#62; RA and the upcoming Myth.   
&#62;    I say, What good is a formation of attack, when it only reforms 
&#62; when it reaches it's destination?  It's hardly worth the effort.
&#62; 
&#62; So, I implore you Blizzard.  Please support a way point system in 
&#62; Starcraft that is useful and do not put in a &#34;formations&#34; 
&#62; option, unless it will actually work.
&#62; 
&#62; FATE
&#62; 

  That is a lot of writing!
  However, although you make many interesting points, I have one 
thing to say: if you say it CAN'T be accomplished on a computer came, 
why complain about it?
  About the only place you will be able to accomplish what you are 
asking is a real-life situation. Computer RTS's, although new and 
being improved all the time, are actually still quite young. Admit 
it. RTS's aren't exactly old-timers yet.
  I agree. The problem with Warcraft II and C&C was the problem with 
formations. You couldn't attack an opponent war-parties rear, because 
the enemy has equal site in all directions, and would charge you. It 
is hard to make strategies utilizing that concept. I've tried, and 
failed many a time.
  I think Blizzard should seriously consider getting the game out 
(soon, I hope). But, I do hope that if they can add a way-point 
system, they do. It would really help!
