<pre>Hey Blizz folks, I noticed the Zerg movie has those black lines 
through it. It wan't full screen, either, but that isn't so annoying.
Is that the final movie format you will use?

This is just idle curiosity, but why don't games have full screen 
640*480 cutscenes? 
Descent 2 is the only game I know of with full, high res cutscenes. 
The transitions in Syndicate Wars were 640*480 SMK files, but the 
intro & end sequence were 320*200. I can't believe CD space is a 
problem, and the modern CPU's can obviously handle it, so... why?


Is this Zerg movie actually going to be in the game, or is it a 
preview like the one on the Diablo CD?
If it is just a preview, (and if you have the space) why not put it 
on the CD in a subdirectory with a bunch of other 'goodies' (other 
previews, Win95 themes, wallpaper, art, etc)



I read earlier that you cannot sell buildings. Fair enough, but can 
the terrans scrap (disassemble) buildings/units to scavange resources 
from them? Or do they have to blow up their own units to use the 
wreckage? That seems annoyingly inefficient. Some kind of reclaim 
option would be better, even if it had no real benifit other than not 
seeming so silly.


Has 8-bit in game colour been finalised, or is 16-bit still a 
possibility?

Also, several levels of alliance were described in the last Uber-
list. Just checking: You CAN set players to be perminantly allied 
(but independent) in the 'create game' screen? (so you could have 3 
allied players against 3 other allied players)

Will the creator of a game be able to assign starting points? This 
would be usefull for large co-op matches (4 on 4, etc), so all the 
players who are allied start close together.</pre>
