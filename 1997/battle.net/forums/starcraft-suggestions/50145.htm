&#62; ive posted these a few times but not many people seem to reply to it 
&#62; and niether has blizzard which was the goal in the first place
&#62; 
&#62; 1 i think in the map editor you should have the option to have 
&#62; difrent maps if you win or lose so you can make huge campains that 
&#62; way you have real reply ability, you could beat it and you could keep 
&#62; playing it over againgoing down diffrent paths, because first of all 
&#62; you wouldnt want to make a well thought out campain with a great plot 
&#62; behind it, have people play it about once than delete it.  this would 
&#62; make the game more none lenier.  for the lack of anything else to do 
&#62; ill put an example 
&#62; 
&#62;        You have to distroy a terran transport in this level 
&#62;                if you win you get the terrans flight plan and go to  
&#62; the terrans secret base to distroy it 
&#62;                          OR
&#62;                You fail to distroy the transport and you have to go 
&#62; to the same planet but now its a harder level and maybe they have the
&#62; secret wepon they were carrying
&#62; 
&#62; 2 The Zergs have the ability to burrow under ground but cant attack 
&#62; and stuff, i think you should be able to select multiple zergs say in 
&#62; a circle set to a ambush mode and click, that way when the enemy guy 
&#62; goes on the point they pop up and attack him that way your zergs can 
&#62; attack from all sides makeing there weaker but higher number of guys 
&#62; more affective, this also would also make you have small scout partys 
&#62; ahead of the main one to make shur you dont get lured into an ambush 
&#62; makeing the game harder and more entertaining
&#62; 
&#62; PS please dont mind my spelling im a crappy speller and i know please 
&#62; dont waist your replys complaining about my spelling waist them 
&#62; coplementing my ideas and adding your ideas for my ideas to my ideas.

MmMMMMMMMM  good idia (just to make you feel better i will spell bad 
;) )i allsoossoo thinc that ann ambuss wod be good idia. althrough 
can u imagin the sise off a fil that had tenty maps in itt. 10-20 meb?

Circumnavagation, psychoanalysis,hypothesis. ;)
