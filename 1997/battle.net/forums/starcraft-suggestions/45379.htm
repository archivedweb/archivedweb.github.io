&#62;    1.)Target Practice

     No real &#34;bullseye&#34;... I suppose you could aim for the 
Apple.
     Coke cans work better.

&#62;    2.)Punching Bag

     Ow! break your fist if you like...

&#62;    3.)Paper Weight

     Too heavy to easily remove the paper.

&#62;    4.)Boat Anchor

     Not heavy enough, and nothing to catch the bottom. 

&#62;    5.)Brick

     You can't mortar plastic, but you might be able to build a house 
        out of Mac II cases, so I'll accept that one.

&#62;    6.)Anvil

      Nope. Would break or melt, and has no curved forms.

&#62;    7.)Speed Bump

      I'm not driving over a computer. 

&#62;    8.)Road Block

     On the other hand, it wouldn't stop me if I really had to drive 
      through it.

&#62;    9.)Foot-Rest

     Hmm. Maybe, but too uncomfortable and not quite high enough.    
     (Maybe a 9600/300.)

&#62;   10.)They make wonderful lawn ornaments

     Maybe in your neighborhood- how far South do you live, anyway?

&#62;   11.)They are recyclable

    Well, I suppose this is a good thing...

&#62;   12.)Great for when you can't find a football

     See &#34;Punching Bag&#34; response.

&#62;   13.)Toilet paper gone?

    Man, I don't even want to know what you were thinking, but it's   
    gotta hurt.

&#62;   14.)Loads netscape so slow your inlaws will never come back
     
    Your in-laws have a pretty short attention span if they can't sit
    there for 15 seconds. Could be the part of the same flawed    
    genetics that would make them stick computers in their lawn...


&#62;   15.)You can beat your brother over the head with the keyboard

    Sounds like a good one to me.


&#62;   16.)If you kick them hard enough, they beep a lot

    I doubt it. All you might do is dislodge a card or mess up the 
hard drive; in either case it probably wouldn't do anything at all.

&#62;   17.)Ash Tray
  
     Have you seen a concave Mac? I haven't.

&#62;   18.)Door stop

     Would stick out and block the path too much. A mouse woulb be   
    better.


&#62;   19.)Break the monitor, and use it to put things in it.

     Why waste a perfectly good monitor? You'd probably just cut      
   yourself. too. Though if you have one of the 12-year old original 
Macs you can convert it into a fishbowl.

&#62;   20.)Break other macs with it
    
     Uh... Settle down, Beavis.


&#62;   21.)Use it as a spare tire

     I think even a flat would roll better, don't you?

&#62;   22.)Melt it, and sell the plastic

       How much could you get for that much plastic? But it's worth a 
 
       try. I for one wouldn't buy it from you.

&#62;   23.)Fire Wood

        Smells horrible and gives you cancer too.

&#62;   24.)Use the mac's cpu chip as a comb

     Mac processors don't have big heatsinks like Pentiums. This is  
   because a newer and faster RISC processer is smaller and cooler, 
    while a newer and faster CISC processor is bigger and hotter.

&#62;   25.)Something to hold your car up when you don't have a jack

     How would you raise up the car in the first place without a 
jack? Other than that, it could work.

&#62;   26.)Trash can (Although it Comes with trash in it,....mac users 
&#62; call it macintosh chips)
 
   Yeah, that could work.  


&#62;   27.)Coffee table

      Um-- No. You'd need at least 3- maybe 6- OK, I guess you could  
  do it that way.

&#62;   28.)Chair 

     I have a chair. It is much more comfortable.


Oddly I used my Mac for a lot of stuff today and none of the above 
were included. You seem to have forgot e-mail, Web browsing, site 
authoring, graphic art, paper writing, and yes, a handful of games. 
(like Starcraft.) Another use is to put in a &#34;Pentium-on-a-
stick&#34; PCI card and install Windows '95 to do all the wonderful 
things you can't do with a Mac. (I have one, and it is growing dusty 
with lack of use.)

There's WAY too much Mac & PC bullshit on this forum right now, but 
at least you were trying to be funny instead of just trying to be an 
idiot, so I thought I'd waste my one contribution to this whole 
stupid argument here.

Go to comp.sys.mac.advocacy, all of you. That's where you're supposed 
to bash Macs.</pre>
