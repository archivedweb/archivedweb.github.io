<pre>Wow! My flame was counter flamed by running onion! I feel so 
priveledged. I understand what you are saying, but almost none of the 
resources are going to be the same. The way all the units work in 
Starcraft compared to Warcraft is completely different. The puds from 
warcraft probable wouldn't make very well for strategy in starcraft. 
Besides, all the units are completely different. It would just be too 
difficult to make a converter. Even if there was a converter, to make 
the battles better you will have to almost recreate the whole 
scenerio, which defeats the purpose. Do you follow what I am saying? 
The converter would almost be counter-productive.

&#62; Scroll up to the top of the forum and what do you see?  a sign that 
&#62; says &#34;Starcraft Suggestions&#34;
&#62; Big Rob came up with a suggestion and suggested it.
&#62; And it is not impossible.  What are your computer programming 
&#62; credentials that you declared something impossible??
&#62; Here is why it is impossible.
&#62; 
&#62; War2, i am almost positive, stores the data in a 2 dimensional array. 
&#62; right?  like a 128x128 map is a square array with 128 squares on each 
&#62; side of a grid, creating a coordinate system.  Now, with that in 
&#62; mind, you can find out the coordinates of every square on the map and 
&#62; what is located on that square.  (this is all really easy to do) for 
&#62; instace, in the box 67x45 there is a tree which is represented by the 
&#62; number 4 (i don't know what the real numbers are, this is just an 
&#62; example of how the data would be stored, maybe 1 for water, 2 for 
&#62; unbuildable land, 3 for buildable land, etc)  Then you could read in 
&#62; the coordinates for each square on the map (the pud file) and then 
&#62; you place a similar object in the coresponding area of a scm file.  
&#62; the gold mines could transfer into gas mines, etc.  and the trees 
&#62; could translate into sc trees.  It doesn't need to be a 1-to-1 
&#62; translation the map surface, for instance it would ignore oil 
&#62; deposits and just put water onto the corresponding area on the scm.  
&#62; The coordinates don't even have to be the same, just a translation of 
&#62; them with a math formula (easy to do).  The resulting scm file would 
&#62; only be on 1 level, and you might have to touch it up manually a 
&#62; little so all the different resources are included, but it is not 
&#62; impossible.
&#62; Think before you flame.  And even if it was impossible at least it 
&#62; shows that Big Rob is thinking and using this forum for what is was 
&#62; meant, suggestions.
&#62; 
&#62; There i am done now

&#62; &#62; The reason why no one has suggested it yet is because it is 
&#62; &#62; impossible!!! not only does starcraft use different resources, but 
&#62; &#62; the lasat is completely different. for one thing, War2 has no hills, 
&#62; &#62; and no cliffs!! It is completely flat! Starcraft has hills, gullies, 
&#62; &#62; vallies, and all other geographical things. Thats not even including 
&#62; &#62; that some maps aren't even set on a planet!!!!!
