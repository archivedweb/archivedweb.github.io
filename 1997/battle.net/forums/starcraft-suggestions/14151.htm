<pre>I realize that the Goliath isnt the most powerful Terran unti, I am 
just saying he said that and contradicted it here, Im not saying that 
is what I believe.  Sorry if it came out wrong, but that is hardly 
what I meant, thank you and good night.

-Actually you turned that around on me, when I compared the mechs to 
peons what I'm saying is that we have no idea if they can actually do 
any real damage.  For all we know they may be too weak.  They may be 
the Paladins in a world full of Ogre-magi.  It all comes down to 
stats.  It may do major damage with bullets and missiles or it may do 
no more than make a bunch of noise.  Will it be abled to stand up to 
a Hydralisk or a Dragoon?  Will it be in between?  We don't know.  We 
hope but we don't know.

About the Protoss having some kind of shield.

*Putting gun to head.  Pulling Trigger.  Ack.*

Of course they have shields, I don't know where my brain went.

And I think you should take a second or third look at the latest 
screen shots involving Goliath Mechs.  There is one showing it's 
weapons systems and lo and behold, not a flamethrower on the thing.  
I have a feeling it will just kind of side step around the area 
blazing it's guns and firing it's missiles, but it will never walk 
directly up to an enemy.  It may even backtrack away instead.  Then 
again maybe they will install the flame-thrower as an upgrade.

I may have forgotten something but I don't know or care, this is the 
second time I've written this damn note, and if the browser crashes 
before I get the stupid thing posted, it never will get posted.
