&#62; Hey all...
&#62; 
&#62; I noticed something.  Blizzard has recently put a lot of effort 
&#62; behind Lord of the Clans, pushing it hard on their web page and such. 
&#62;  They have also said nothing about Starcraft recently-- their entire 
&#62; web page is now devoted to LOTC.  It seems to me that Blizzard is 
&#62; putting all their effort behind LOTC (especially since their web page 
&#62; says that it will be out by the holidays) and doing less with 
&#62; Starcraft.  Now I don't know a hell of a lot about game development, 
&#62; so if I seem ignorant, I am-- please help me.  However, I didn't 
&#62; think that it would be possible to put out two games of Blizzard 
&#62; quality within 3 or 4 months of each other.  Is this possible?  Or is 
&#62; Blizzard screwing over Starcraft?
&#62;

First of all, the reason behind the lack of information about 
Starcraft on Blizzard's page could be from a variey of reasons; such 
as they know all the good pages already out there as I have stated 
before, they think Activision will &#34;steal&#34; some of their 
ideas (may have been at first, but Dark Reign will be coming out so 
this reason is basically gone), and a huge build up of anticipation 
by the customers.  Expect a huge surge of information around the 
25th, since Blizzard will be doing an interview over IRC with new 
screen shots, ironically this a day after Dark Reign is to be 
released, which I believe was pointed out by Iolaus? if my memory 
serves me correctly (maybe not).  Also, all of Blizzard's work is 
going into Starcraft right now.  The only work done for LOTC is on 
updating the page which takes not even an hour when they bother to do 
it and the pictures you see are being done by a team in Russia, not 
by Blizzard employees or anything like that, this was mentioned in PC 
Gamer's last issue.  Now, one more thing, although it is said LOTC is 
to be released holiday season, I doubt it will be.  It might be, but 
I doubt it.  Remember Diablo?  Spring '96, then Fall '96, then 
holiday season '96, it wasnt out until January.  So in answer to your 
question: No, Blizzard is not screwing over Starcraft.
