<pre>Out of all the lame and cliche attempts at trying to get Blizzard to 
release info on the release, this one is actually pretty refreshing.
Even I would like to see this happen, unfortunately, ... well, you 
know.
Thanx anyway, Nathan   &#34;,

&#62; &#34;We don't have a release date at this time for Starcraft or the 
&#62; shareware/demo. It's our policy to avoid
&#62; specific release dates simply because we don't know what may pop up 
&#62; at the last minute. We are 
&#62; shooting for a release before the end of this year.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;...before the end of this year.&#34; is kind of vague, since 
&#62; tomorrow would qualify and so would December 30th.  Further, 
&#62; &#34;shooting for&#34; implies that you might not even release it 
&#62; before the end of this year.  How about announcing non release info?  
&#62; You must be able to see at least a week into the future, so you could 
&#62; announce that &#34;Starcraft definitely will not be available this 
&#62; week.&#34;   If your foresight extends to beyond a week, you might 
&#62; announce that &#34;Starcraft definitely will not be available in the 
&#62; next 20 days.&#34;  This way, we the Starcraft enthusiasts would not 
&#62; have to check your site on a daily basis to see if the Starcraft beta 
&#62; or final release was available yet.  Instead we could wait X number 
&#62; of days/weeks/months/years before checking again.  Think of all the 
&#62; Internet bandwidth that could be saved by millions of people not 
&#62; going to your site to see that Starcraft is STILL NOT AVAILABLE :(</pre>
