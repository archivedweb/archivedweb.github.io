<pre>Couldn't you put up a small little note on your main page were it 
says when the last update of you HP took place? It's a bit irritating 
to click everywhere to see if something has changed..

Just checked some screenshots on Lord of the Clans (hardly remember 
when I did the last time), and when I think about it, it actually 
seems kewl, never though about that before.. (duhh! What a misstake!) 
Oh well, guess I will have to buy that too.. You are ruining me 
Blizzard! So stop making good games! Hmm.. no, I changed my mind, 
continue with that, you've given me some happy hours =) (No, some 
happy weeks that is.. no months..actually... err.. hey, I'm still 
playing War2.. aah damn, its been 2 years!)

I can't belive why everyone says that these commercials in the forums 
is so bad. I think they're great! Now you'll earn more ca$h and 
Battle.Net can stay free. These commercials don't bother me a thing, 
and if someone says they're bad, then you tell me why? So think 
twice..

A Diablo2 forum, what would you say about that? I mean, it's in an 
early stage of development, so now would be great for suggestions =)
Question of the week: &#34;What's so special about this new scenario-
editor?&#34;
I DEMAND a new screenshot which includes a battle between all 3 races 
(the three races are Terran, Zerg and Protoss. Incase you forgot ;)
And increase the posting limit to at least three! I can't see why?! 
You tell me..

Oh well, I think that was all, uhmm.. wait! No, hmm.. yes, hold it! 
No, err.. no, no more.. oh well, merry christmas, or was that 
yesterday? No, hmm.. ah! I got it! It's today, isn't it? No? Oh well, 
I better trust your word.. uhm, happy new year? No? Ahh, damn.. I 
can't figure this out at all.. ok, let's say happy Thursday then..

C'ya!</pre>
