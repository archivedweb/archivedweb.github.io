&#62; I recently bought Dark Reign(for all you flame happy idiots out 
&#62; there, I can afford to buy both that and Starcraft, so ha!).  It is a 
&#62; good game, with alotta cool features.  But there are also some 
&#62; mistakes activision made which I think you should double check on. 
&#62; Here goes:
&#62; 
&#62; 1:  Lookalike units-This is SOoooo annoying. Is it a tank with a 
&#62; laser gun, is it a tank with that weird burst fire, etc. Actually, 
&#62; with the exception of a few tanks, the mobile machinery wasn't that 
&#62; hard to tell apart, but they really screwed upin terms of infantry 
&#62; and units.  First off, all the infantry, regardless of which side 
&#62; they are, look alike except for very small graphic differences 
&#62; gunwise. You are not gonna be able to look that close in a fight.  
&#62; The buildings are the worst part though.  You have to first memorize 
&#62; what each building is and does, and then rememorize what it looks 
&#62; like upgraded.  My advice is to go the same way you did with 
&#62; war2:make the purpose and function of each unit obvious, i.e. farms 
&#62; had plowed fields, grunts had obvious looking weapons, and the 
&#62; alchemists looked..well, like alchemists.  Make the flamethrowers 
&#62; standing still animation show fire, have the machine gun guys fire 
&#62; off in the air every os often, etc.  Above all, include the sounds 
&#62; for buildings when u click on them, as this helps you to get them 
&#62; memorized more quickly.

Beat the game on hard setting and you won't have anymore problems 
telling units apart, trust me.

&#62; 2: Medical/Repair personel-Who's idea was this? Flog that person with 
&#62; a wet noodle! I think the idea of infantry like units, without 
&#62; weapons, which repaired/healed other units u moved near them started 
&#62; with red alert...unfortunately, the dark reign people didn't think 
&#62; enough to realize this is a crappy idea.  Moving a medical unit with 
&#62; a group, trying to keep it in back, keep it out of fire, move it to 
&#62; key healing positions, moving injured units back to it....this isn't 
&#62; fun, its a chore.  If you are going to have healing for protoss and 
&#62; terrans, make it mass healing, such as a protoss which can create a 
&#62; healing field all around it, which affects all units at the same time 
&#62; within the field.  Or at least, if you must have a doctor/whatever 
&#62; unit(god forbid), make it AUTOMATICALLY run out to heal anything 
&#62; within its sight. Clicking the healer, selecting 'heal this unit' 
&#62; waiting for it to be done, selecting 'heal this next unit'...don't do 
&#62; that

Having field medics and mechanics are more realistic.  Plus it's not 
a chore at all, just group them accordingly.  If done right, all you 
need is to hit a # button and right click on the unit, done.  

&#62; 3 Stupid independence factor:  I agree that the units should fire 
&#62; back automatically if an enemy attacks, and maybe even pursue.  But 
&#62; if you let them pursue, at least give them some brains.  In dark 
&#62; reign, if you are massing a group outside the enemy's base, just 
&#62; waiting for your rift creator to take out the enemy's neutron 
&#62; accelerators(big BIG tower), your enemy could just have any unit come 
&#62; up, take a couple pot shots at your group, and then run back for the 
&#62; towers.  No matter what independence you have selected, your 
&#62; attackers WILL follow that unit back, and basically get their buts 
&#62; kicked by the towers...make sure that in a similar SC condition, the 
&#62; units will know the range of the towers/whatever, and act to stay out 
&#62; of it unless you say so.  And for heavens sake, include a 'stay put 
&#62; no matter what' command like you had in war2.

Artillary would work much better against towers in the first place.  
The enemy dinging you can be easily solved.  If you wish to use the 
Rift Creator.  Use a drone or a scout(if you're playing the Tograns), 
to do the scouting for you, not your tanks.  About the unit knowing 
range of Tower and stay away, that's very very unrealistic.  Would 
you know the range of my M16 on the field of battle and effectively 
stay out of it judging only by sight?  If you can see the weapon, it 
can hit you. 

&#62; 4:Finally, a word about modems and being connected.  Alotta modems, 
&#62; such as mine:(, have a nasty tendency to kick out without letting you 
&#62; know every so often.  In windows this isn't a problem, as you can see 
&#62; the little modem icon stop flashing its lights.  I'd ask that you 
&#62; make  a similar icon, to show that you are still connected, and your 
&#62; modem is still at work.  Also, make sure that if the disconnect 
&#62; situation does occur, you have a'cancel' button no matter where you 
&#62; are.

Hmm.. don't know about modem connects... only played thru T1 network.
 
&#62; Well, thats it.  Btw, any new word on how the protoss teleportation 
&#62; system works?(I still like the diabloesque portal system 
&#62; better...opening a portal between two enemy bases...muahahhaha:)

In anycase, I agree DR is a good game, though probably not gonna be 
as good as Starcraft, but I'm sure it's a hell of a lot better then 
TA.
BTW, AoE is a great game, I think Starcraft has some very stiff 
challenge in AoE.</pre>
