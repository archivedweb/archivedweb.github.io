<pre>&#62; Why wait around for Starcraft to come out, when you can play Age of 
&#62; Empires right now.  I never thought there would be a day when I would 
&#62; say War2 wasn't the best game ever made.

If war2 had just came out, more people would be still playing it.  
What
we are all suffering from is called war2 burn out.  Its like coming 
off
the rebound with a woman.  You go for just about the first thing 
available.
:)

&#62; Damn, Age of Empires is by 
&#62; far the best strategy wargame I have ever played.  Starcraft has 3 
&#62; races....Age of Empire has 12 tribes to chose from...each with their 
&#62; own strenghts and weaknesses...

Maybe so, but the tribes are all the same, its just some dont get
certain units, buildings, or upgrades. But as you say, they do all 
have
differenct special skills.

Starcraft on the other hand has three *DIFFERENT* races, they dont 
look
the same, or even play the same.

&#62; Coastal maps, isalnd maps, highland 
&#62; maps, inland maps....complete random map generation.....awesome

They are discussing random maps, and starcraft supposedly already has
quite a few map types.

&#62; mulitplayer playability.  I've only played one AoE game yet that had 
&#62; enough lag to make the game uplayable.  You just have to play this 
&#62; game.  Their are so many upgrades and buildings that you typically 
&#62; can not even come close to using them all in one game.

thats cause you dont need them all, with a 50 unit cap, you aren't 
going
to use a lot of the units &#60;but then again, it depends who's 
playing&#62;.

&#62; This is where 
&#62; all the strategy comes in.  You must determine from the multitude of 
&#62; options, what to spend your resources on.  You must exploit the 
&#62; strenghts of your tribe while exploiting the weakness of the other 
&#62; tribes.  What other game can have an 8 multiplayer game, and each 
&#62; player a different race/tribe?

Master of orion 2 &#60;you didnt say it had to be RTs&#62;.

&#62; None I know of.  Do yourself a 
&#62; favor....forget about Starcraft and get Age of Empires...It's in 
&#62; stores now people, unlike Starcraft...

Thats the one argument i actually agree with, Starcraft is not out.
If you need a game NOW then get aoe, but often the best experiences
take the longest time to attain.

- why do people keep asking us to get other games, could it be that
  that they are tired of playing alone? &#60;hehehe j/k&#62;</pre>
