<pre>I REALLY do not understand the hyper about TA.  TA is not that fun a 
game.  So many things about that game is unbalancing.  Big Bertha 
ring bell?  Give me a break, so what if TA have over 100 units?  Blah 
blah blah, half the units does the same thing and the other half you 
don't use.  Who'd use basic Kbots or Vehicles when you've upgrade to 
Advanced?  Plus TA has a large assortment of bugs.  Invisible units, 
unknown energy source that just happens to fill up your energy bar 
fully and you don't get any metal for the next 5 mins.  Also, having 
a super unit like the Commander is really pointless and idiotic.  
Commander cheese ring a bell?  I guess you have to set the game to 
&#34;game ends when Commander dies&#34;, and then your opponent just 
happily nuke your commander and send everything he's got against you 
commander.  I don't know about you, but I've never heard a war was 
over just because the commander of the army perished.  Their 
efficiancy might go down, but surely they're not gonna just throw up 
their arms are say &#34;we're dead&#34;.  Last but not least, TA's 
graphics is not all that.  The Terrain looks like a cheap rendering 
job that my college classmates can do.  The details blow chunks 
considering everything looks like same.  And the units looks like a 
bunch of box piled together that has no obvious characteristics to 
distinguish one from the other.  Hmm.. does TA still sound so good?  
Try playing a Multi-player game with a friend he has build up a 
massive defense, and 
all you can use is big berthas while he big berthas you back.  
Monotonous? I think so.  There is one cool thing about TA though, you 
can set trees on fire.  It's quite amusing but that's the only thing 
that still amused me about TA after clocking about 30 hours of play 
time.</pre>
