How can you guys complain about the release so much!  As far as I'm
concerned Blizzard is the most awesome company ever made.  Who else do
you know would spend all their time just to make a game right and add
all the multiplayer options they are adding (enough to keep us 
playing 
it into the next century), and be able to use it for free on 
battlenet.  And be able to spawn multiple copies so people can try the
game out on multiplayer with their friends (and of course they will 
buy it, who wouldn't after playing :)).  And did I mention 
battlenet is free!  What a bunch of spoiled babies Blizzard is making
of a bunch of you. :)  That they are taking the time to do the game
right is what makes Blizzard the best, and if they ever stopped that,
I would stop doing what I do, which is buy their games.  But as long
as Blizzard keeps making games the way the do, I will buy every last
one of them :)
