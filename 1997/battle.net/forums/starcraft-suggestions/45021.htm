<pre>It was not a real orchestar all right. I have a GuS PnP with 8 megs 
onboard and it sounds pretty much the same, woodwinds and brass are 
better and strings are somewhat worse, still sound synthetic ( 
haven't yet heard a good synthesized violin). And by the way, there 
are no symphonic bands. It's called an orchestra, small orchestra is 
called a chamber orchestra. I dont think Blizzard is ever going to 
record the live orchestra perform the War2 music though, they would 
have to gather a chamber orchestra + choir + harpsichord + 
percussion, and some of the pieces would require a bit of rehearsing 
; there are some things that are almost unplayable.

&#62; 
&#62; Well, I'm pretty sure that the music on the war2 CD is by a real 
&#62; orchestra.  I'm not certain, I got a crappy sb16, I don't know what 
&#62; cool stuff comps can do with sounds now.  It sounded like real 
&#62; instruments to me, and I'm a percussionistin my HS band.  I take 
&#62; private drum lessons and everything.  The music is VERY well 
&#62; composed.  But, of course that music is no match for the StarWars 
&#62; music(Just had to mention it)  I'd like to see what Blizzard has in 
&#62; store for the Starcraft music.  I REALLY hope that they'll release a 
&#62; CD with just the music of the game on it.  I also hope that you can 
&#62; pop in your own music CD into the drive and play it while kicking 
&#62; some ass on battle.net.  I'd like to see how well the StarWars music 
&#62; goes along with it.
