<pre>I don't have finals then because my college is on a term schedule, 
but that should be about the time for midterms.  I guess one of the
things that we're supposed to be learning here is self-control and 
Blizzard is just giving us an opportunity to test ourselves.  :-)

I, myself, will be most likely preordering the game if possible, so 
I will have it when it's released.  I can only hope that it's not a 
true GPA killer and I can wait until Christmas Break.

&#62; I dont know when the release date for starcraft will be, but I am 
&#62; gonna ask that the release date be scheduled for
&#62; the middle of December.  If this is already the targeted release date 
&#62; then good, but if it looks like the game may
&#62; come out earlier then i am asking for a slight postponement.  The 
&#62; reason:  FINALS.  I have finals the 2nd week in
&#62; December and if comes out before I take them I am afraid that my 
&#62; semester will be shot.  Some may say that I need
&#62; the self-discipline to force myself to not buy the game and study, 
&#62; and while I might be able to wait a week or 2 after
&#62; it was released before I bought it, all I would be able to think 
&#62; about those 2 weeks would be how good the game is
&#62; and wondering what I am missing.  So please for the love of all 
&#62; college students everywhere (at least those of us
&#62; that have finals during that time) I am asking for the slight delay.  
&#62; After all, the extra time would allow for more
&#62; refinement of the game,   </pre>
