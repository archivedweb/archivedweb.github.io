&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62;  It's OK. We all know you can't help the way you are.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62;  Btw, got any good Starcraft Suggestions?
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62;  					__Iolaus__  
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Here is one good suggestion I thought of...
&#62; &#62; &#62; (Hey UNIX Fans!!!)
&#62; &#62; &#62; ps -fe | egrep 'the weak|the lame|the unintelligent' &#62; Iolaus Fan 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Club
&#62; &#62; &#62; cat Iolaus Fan Club | cut -d' ' -f3 | KILL
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;Yadda 
&#62; &#62; Yadda
&#62; &#62; Yadda				C'mon Sommykins, it ain't that bad :)
&#62; &#62; 				ps Got any Starcraft Suggestions?	
&#62; &#62; 					__Iolaus__
&#62; &#62; 
&#62;   Ahh yes.  It seems I have over estimated your intelligence yet 
&#62; again Iolaus.  A mistake that is becoming far to common.   I thought 
&#62; you might have fair sport trying to figure out what this standard 
&#62; UNIX command does(and the message therein).  However, it seems that 
&#62; the Computer Department at Foothills has failed to convey even the 
&#62; most rudimentary fundamentals of computer science--regular 
&#62; expressions.  I guess the quality of education in community colleges 
&#62; these day's just isn't what it used to be.  
&#62;  
&#62;   It is also interesting to note that one of your lower 
&#62; minions(KROWA) didn't even know that it was a command line and 
&#62; likened it to himself &#34;banging&#34; on a keyboard.  I find it 
&#62; amazing that an individual with this level of intelligence could even 
&#62; turn a computer on.  Much less find his way to this forum and spread 
&#62; his abhorrent stupidity across the Internet.  
&#62;   
&#62;    Speaking of spreading abhorrent stupidity--I noticed you have quit 
&#62; submitting posts that contain anything resembling intelligence.  It 
&#62; seems all you do now is wait by the computer all day until I post 
&#62; something.  At which time you quickly spring into action and add your 
&#62; cute little dainty comments.  Many people (not just me) have noticed 
&#62; this.  How you used to have somewhat meaningful things to say.   Now 
&#62; you've been reduced to publishing your snide drivel any chance you 
&#62; can get.  This is truly sad Iolaus.  
&#62; 
&#62;   You must be truly unhappy with the person you are to vicariously 
&#62; live  your life in this tiny forum.  I've said it once...I'll say it 
&#62; again...my condolences to your mother on birthing a child of such 
&#62; embarassing caliber.
&#62;                                     with regards
&#62;                                     -SOMMS


   SOMMS, you little little man. I begin to wonder that your paranoia 
about everyone being a minion of Iolaus is a voice(s) in your head or 
do you not remember that you attacked me first so therefore there are 
three factions involved here if not more. You, me and Iolaus there 
are undoubtedly others but I pressume since I was the first I would 
belong amongst the list and Iolaus is self explanatory. I knew about 
your damn UNIX crap but your inteligence only limited to  200 to the 
power of 0 could not comprehend a simple coment on your inability to 
comprehend that no one gives a shit about your gyberish typeing. That 
is another reason you don't belong here. Even though you get as much 
blood to your brain as a dead bug. You apparently lack the brain 
power to notice that your not only not wanted but not needed on this 
forum. You not only do not contribute to this forum but you actually 
took away from it! Go away, talk to your family (If you have one), go 
out with a girl or if you prefer, a guy. Next time don't confuse me 
with a minion of someone and since you do consider me a minion of 
Iolaus then your saying that Iolaus is a good enought leader in order 
to have SO MANY MINIONS. Where are your minions then? Dont have any? 
Aw......
