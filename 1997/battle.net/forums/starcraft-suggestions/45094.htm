<pre>First thing, guess which cartoon inspired my title? Now who said 
adventure games are bad? That is right!!! Roger Wong, please open 
your mind a little bit. Where did you get the idea that adventure 
games were point and click. In SIERRA's Wuest for Glory series there 
was much interaction, (Although 3 and 4 began to look more like an 
arcade and point and click but 1 and 2 were some of the best games I 
ever played) Difficult puzzles which were excellent. Replayability? 
What I HOPE Blizzard is doing with WA is making branching plots, or 
at least if not branching slightly different outcomes depending in 
your choices. Unfortunatly it will only have one charachter and if I 
guess right only the orcs will win. But Thrall does not fit the 
stereotype of orcs and those humans were real... Anti -human like. 
Oh, and for replayability, there is always the fun of looking for 
easter eggs. I  was an RPG/adventure fanatic until Blizzard started 
me on RTS, I was deadset against not having to deal with more than 10 
chrs, not to mention them having all look the same, But Blizzard got 
me hooked on War2, So why not let themt try to get you hooked on 
Adventure. Not to mention the fact that there are very few orcs left 
on Azeroth and an RTS would not fit the storyline. An RPG fits it 
better. In fact I was going to suggest an RPG for the next chapter, 
so I got the web site and WOW there is WA. Besides, a fourth Warcraft 
RTS straight was getting a but dry. Enjoy SC as the next RTS and let 
us hope the WA starts a new venue for Blizzard. Although if you are 
just srtarting with Adventure I would suggest Sierra's QFG anthology 
which is four games in one, and there  is the final sequel coming out 
soon. 

Last thing. Point and click? What exactly is an RTS. Admittedly there 
is Strategy but in an Adventure there is a different kind of 
thinking. Puzzles. :) Hope you open your mind and try WA.

&#62; An adventure game from Blizzard? Point and click adventure. Boring!!! 
&#62; For the many of us RTS fans who enjoy Blizzard games, how many of us 
&#62; do you expect would go out and buy a crappy adventure game? Adventure 
&#62; games and RPGs don't last long. Once you finish an adventuer game 
&#62; once, it would be put away for good and no one would ever touch it 
&#62; again. Adventure games don't have replayability or multiplayer 
&#62; support so who the hell would bother? Once you've finished it, if you 
&#62; were to ever play it again, you would already know exactly what to 
&#62; do. No fun, no thinking required. I wish Blizzard would cancel their 
&#62; work on Warcraft Adventures and use their valuable time (which they 
&#62; are currently wasting on Warcraft Adventures) to make new and better 
&#62; games (e.g. Warcraft III) or finish off some games (e.g. Starcraft). 
&#62; I mean what is the point of making WA, apart from the storyline 
&#62; linking to War3? Who would buy it? Apart from those idiots out there 
&#62; who think WA IS Warcraft 3.
&#62; 
&#62; I know this is not the place to talk about this, but since I've 
&#62; started, who cares. Diablo 2? What happened to diablo 1 better not 
&#62; happen to diablo 2. Please tell the Diablo team (I dont want to waste 
&#62; a message posting the diablo forum then waiting another 2 hours to 
&#62; post again) to make Diablo 2 TOTALLY bug and cheat free. That means 
&#62; no duping or hacks. Have more options to fight the lag too. Have a 
&#62; menu option when launching a game so there is a maximum ping 
&#62; requirement. For example, you can set max ping: 700 so that no one 
&#62; with higher ping than 700 can join. I finished diablo in single 
&#62; player the day after I got it. I played over battle.net and with 
&#62; others, experienced all the cheaters and laggers and pkers. Killed 
&#62; diablo 20 times. Got bored of it within a month and never played it 
&#62; again. How short lived. If I had a wish, I'd wish Blizzard would skip 
&#62; Diablo 2 and warcraft adventures.</pre>
