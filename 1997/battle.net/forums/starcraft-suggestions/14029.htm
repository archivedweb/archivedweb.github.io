&#62; What I mean by that is that the terrans seem to have all the 
&#62; advantages and almost no disadvantages.  
&#62; The protoss have the enormous disadvantage of needing the portals.  
&#62; Take those away in a surgical strike and you take away their powers.  
&#62; They also have the disadvantage of having fewer(though stronger) 
&#62; units.  Anyone who plays war2 knows that 4 or 5 peons can easily kill 
&#62; a grunt, with only one peon dying in return.
&#62;   On the other hand, the zerg have the disadvantage of needing creep 
&#62; to build anything,  If you can somehow trap them, they won't be able 
&#62; to build any more stuff(tower them in with the transformer 
&#62; tank/towers?)  The zergs also have the weakest units,although they do 
&#62; grow stronger with time.
&#62;   The terrans seem to hold all the cards.  Not only are they not 
&#62; restricted by the portals or creep building wise, but they can even 
&#62; move the buildings!  They also have what appears to be the most 
&#62; balanced fighting force, having enough numbers to take care of the 
&#62; protoss while having their units strong enough to withstand a zerg 
&#62; swarm.  They also have a lot of funky(yes I said funky:) abilities 
&#62; such as the aforementioned tank/tower transformer(is it an autobot or 
&#62; deceptacon?), the ability to cloak their ships, the ability to 
&#62; scavenge materials, etc.  
&#62; I know that the other 2 races(particularly the prooss) will have 
&#62; their own special abilities, but I have heard no solid info on what 
&#62; they might be or how they will counter the terrans.  Hopefully 
&#62; blizzard will reveal more specs soon:)

     I dont think that we have enough knowledge about Starcraft yet 
to make the assumption that the Terrans are more powerful than the 
other 2 races, all we have seen are some screenshots. How do you know 
all this other stuff though?           Anyway go to 
&#60;<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nv/etm/index.html">http://www.angelfire.com/nv/etm/index.html</a>&#62; for the E.T.M. 
homepage. In case you didnt notice I shortened my name from Supreme 
Commander-High General Shawn to just Commander Shawn, it just seemed 
to conceded dont you think?</pre>
