&#62; As mentioned earlier in this forum, I believe that units, as they see 
&#62; (and live) through more battle should become more powerful. Like 
&#62; &#34;levelling up.&#34; If you continously harass the enemy with this 
&#62; one Arbiter, or other flying ship (even ground units),  it should 
&#62; become more powerful (however, ever so slightly). 
&#62; 
&#62; Another thing that would be interesting would be the ability to name 
&#62; units. This would be perfectly useless in a battle, but would be a 
&#62; neat little addition to the game. However, &#34;unique&#34; units or 
&#62; &#34;characters&#34; should not be able to be renamed.
&#62; 
&#62; Something else that would be cool, considering there is a maximum 
&#62; size of grouping for each race, would be Generals, or perhaps just 
&#62; unique characters. The idea would be that in any group that this 
&#62; general is grouped with, each unit gains a little plus. This plus 
&#62; would be extremely small, and the Generals would be weak, because the 
&#62; Zerg would have an advantage because they can group more units 
&#62; together.

Hi,

I mentioned both these ideas a long time ago, the naming thing WOULD 
be pretty useless, but being able to hotkey a group of units and 
naming would be nifty (i.e. The 32nd Mobile Artillary Force, or Alpha 
Squadron),  The &#34;general&#34; idea would be good, it would be 
like some of the unique enemies in diablo (like that one goat-bowman, 
who shot blood star instead of arrows, and passed this ability on to 
all the goatmen around him).  I'm not peeved at you for taking my 
ideas or anything, I'm glad that other people have the same ideas I 
suggested.
