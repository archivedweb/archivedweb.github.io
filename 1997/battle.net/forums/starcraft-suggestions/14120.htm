&#62; As mentioned earlier in this forum, I believe that units, as they see 
&#62; (and live) through more battle should become more powerful. Like 
&#62; &#34;levelling up.&#34; If you continously harass the enemy with this 
&#62; one Arbiter, or other flying ship (even ground units),  it should 
&#62; become more powerful (however, ever so slightly). 
&#62; 
&#62; Another thing that would be interesting would be the ability to name 
&#62; units. This would be perfectly useless in a battle, but would be a 
&#62; neat little addition to the game. However, &#34;unique&#34; units or 
&#62; &#34;characters&#34; should not be able to be renamed.
&#62; 
&#62; Something else that would be cool, considering there is a maximum 
&#62; size of grouping for each race, would be Generals, or perhaps just 
&#62; unique characters. The idea would be that in any group that this 
&#62; general is grouped with, each unit gains a little plus. This plus 
&#62; would be extremely small, and the Generals would be weak, because the 
&#62; Zerg would have an advantage because they can group more units 
&#62; together

a cool addition to this would be if your general gets killed u lose 
the scenario. in war wind u had a chief that u had to protect (he was 
part of every scenario not just an escort mission)(kinda represented 
you as you played.)if he died the scenario ended. i feel that this 
would be a cool multiplayer option,kinda leads to desperate assasin 
missions and the like. it should be just and option tho,it an be 
irritating in every scenario.
