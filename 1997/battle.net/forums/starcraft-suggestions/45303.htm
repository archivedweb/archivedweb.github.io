<pre>Ok, I hate to be part of this no-sense war about Mac and Pc... but, I 
need to enlight someone... first of all, i'm a PC user, and I don't 
have a mac, just for the fact that the games are _LATE_... If the 
game would come out at the same time, I'll probably be typing this on 
a Mac...probably...
So, now with the Enlightment

&#62; So you had a 300 Mhz macintosh 6 months ago.  What do you run on it?  
&#62; not Diablo.  Nothing new from LucasArts.  They are &#34;re-
&#62; evaluating&#34; their macintosh strategy.  I don't think a 
&#62; translation is necessary, but I'll provide one anyways: We're gonna 
&#62; discontinue Macintosh products.  Macintosh may have a good processor, 
&#62; but the O/S is horrible, the systems are considerably slower than 

&#62; similarly equipped PC's and not much software is coming out.  So now, 
&#62; what were you saying?
&#62; 
&#62; Roland
&#62; 
&#62; btw, in your signature, you not only mis-spell your name (lunatic, 
&#62; note the 'a') you also screw up the five letter word 'lurks'.  don't 
&#62; feign intelligence, because you aren't very good at it.

I got to stop you now... the Mac O/S are FAR better than any windows 
O/S out there. What do you think Microsoft is TRYING to copy? yes, 
the mac O/S!! That's it!! the only advantage of windows is the 
copy/cut/paste features across differents programs... but that's the 
only one, the mac O/S got _speed_, they are more userfriendly, etc. 
So, get your facts before talking.
For the speed... hmmmm... the mac systems are FASTER than any PC, and 
now they can run PC programs with a little lost of speed. But, you'll 
say, HEY! it's not as fast than on the PC... but, consider this... 
Can you run Mac programs on your PC? NO!! that's the point, so mac 
can run more programs than any PC. 
Now, why do Apples is losing money if Mac are so good?? Because of 
ONE thing, marketing! they are genius, they were and are pioneer in 
the computer world, but, they don't know how to sell and advertise 
something... Why do you think so many peoples like you think that 
Win95 is better that a Mac O/S?? because, apples didn't advertise 
their computer and technology, that's why!! So micro$hitis trying to 
use this flaw to advertise their O/S... Win95!! A great inovation in 
the O/S world... Yeah, right... Mac had the same thing years ago!
To conclude, mac are not a piece of crap, but are very good computer, 
but apples dont know anything about marketing!! But, I agree with 
everyone on the fact that for us, gamers, the mac sucks, all the 
great games are coming late!!

I'm not a mac expert, so I may have say something that is not true, 
but, i dont think I did such a thing, if so, please tell me.
Try to get out of the Micro$hit influence and inform you on the Mac 
before saying something. I'm not saying that mac rules and PC sucks, 
i'm just trying to enlight someone on the darkside(read Micro$hit).
