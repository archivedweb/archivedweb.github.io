<pre>Dear Blizzard,

This idea is one that myself and others in the past mentioned but 
alas, I saw no response to...not even a &#34;go to hell&#34;!  Here 
is is anyway:

StarCraft, I take it, runs very much like WarCraft, in the sense that 
you control units, defeat your enemies, and voila, that's it!  Once 
you join another game on B.Net, everything happens much the same way. 
 Well, how about adding a little bit more depth to B.Net games?  What 
I mean is, instead of just giving players the chance to play &#34;one-
off&#34; games, why not create an entirely new Battle.Net server 
dedicated just to a StarCraft Galactic Campaign?  The Campaign could 
run as follows:

First of all, we'd all need some kind of Campaign patch to 
participate in this game facility! (I say patch because I don't want 
you guys going off to implement this now)  Each person can then enter 
a pre-set StarCraft Galaxy, filled with solar systems and planets 
etc.  Each player can then travel to certain solar systems and the 
planets within them.  If they are uninhabited, the player can claim 
this domain as his/her own.  If someone else owns it, the player must 
fight for it in the same manner as any Starcraft game.  The standard 
maximum of 8 players can join a battle as usual.

Once a planet is owned, the player can rename it and it is basically 
classed as a chatroom for all allies, but if an enemy attacks it, the 
player is given the option to either Defend or Let it Fall.  When 
players conquer planets and go offline, that specific planet cannot 
be instantly taken over by an online player for 24-48 hours as it is 
protected for that length of time.  Opponents can leave their name on 
that planet's Battle Roster so that if the planet's owner comes back 
online within the 24-48 hour limit, he/she is informed of the 
challenge.  If the time limit elapses and the owner still has not 
logged on, the planet is then free to be retaken instantly by any 
other player.

This extra galactic depth can make REALLY good use of the presently 
forming clans, and maybe eventually, one single clan will rise to 
dominance over the entire galaxy! :)  Please, if anyone feels the 
need to comment on this or other factors on this subject, feel free! 
:)
