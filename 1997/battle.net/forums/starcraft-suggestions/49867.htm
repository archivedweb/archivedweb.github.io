<pre>     

      1.  Unit/Building/Technology restrictor: This is an absolute 
MUST.  This would allow the mapmaker to label units as 
&#34;untrainable,&#34; buildings as &#34;unbuildable,&#34; and 
upgrades as, um, &#34;unupgradeable&#34; :)  The mapmaker should be 
able to specify which sides are affected by this; player one might be 
able to build all units, and player 2 might only be able to build 
SCVs.
 
      2,  Hierarchy Editor, for lack of a better name:  This would 
allow the mapmaker to change the order in which buildings and units 
can be built.  For ex. in War2, you had to have a barracks and a 
lumber mill to build an archer, a barracks and a blacksmith to build 
a ballista, and you had to have  a barracks to upgrade to a keep. The 
mapmaker should be able to define and alter these terms, and change 
the way the game &#34;progresses.&#34;  If you had to have every 
structure in the game before __________ (really strong unit) could be 
built, players might think twice about building swarms of ____________

      3.  Unit Statistics Editor: Start with the awesome War2 editor 
Daniel Limberg made, and build up.  Besides being able to edit all 
base stats, the mapmaker should be able to edit both current and max 
health (you could create wounded units) and both current and max ammo 
(dueling at dawn :P).  You should be able to edit the weapon for each 
unit, the projectile for each unit, the sound for each unit, the 
portrait for each unit, and the graphix for each unit.  If you won't 
allow us to create our OWN graphics, then atleast let us mix and 
match the game graphics.

      4.  Landscape Stat editor: If Starcraft is set up so that there 
are variable terrains (units walk slow on sand, fast on a road, slow 
uphill, fast downhill, mechanized units go faster in sand than foot 
units, etc.) than you should be able to alter the effects of each 
terrain.  Make it so zerg can walk 2 times as fast on creep than on 
other terrain, for example (I think this might already be in the 
game)  also, it would be nice if you could edit the effects the 
landscapes had on the troops (creep healed the zerg slowly, the 
protoss homeworld makes the protoss recharge their &#34;magic&#34; 
bar 2 times faster, the terran world is rich in harvestable metals, 
etc.)  Maybe you could make it so that there were certain areas that 
would hurt a unit (make a poisonous forest or swamp).

     5.  Here's a question: can you make custom installation 
missions? I hope so.

     6.  If the terran tank can still morph into a permenate, 
immobile tower, be able to start a map with some already morphed 
tanks rooted in the earth.  Same goes for any other morphing unit.  

     7. Be able to right click on any UNIT (not building) and pull up 
this menu:

         A.) Upgrades-lets you add and takeaway upgrades to the unit. 
         B.) equipment slot-lets you specify what powerup is in the 
unit's equipment slot.
         C.) preorders- this is something i really like :) this 
feature would let you give any units that start out on the map one 
order for them to act out as soon as the game starts.  You could have 
it so that there is a gigantic enemy base, with units preset to 
patrol the parimeters as soon as the game starts.  Or, have it so 
that one of your forces &#34;accidentally&#34; wanders upon a 
detachment of enemy zergs.  Action right from the start equals 
satisfaction till the very end :P
         D.) Posture- lets you specify which direction the unit is 
looking, and, if there are zerg, if the unit is burrowed in the 
ground or not.
         E.) If the unit can attack, be able to choose how much ammo 
it has

      8. Be able to right click on any BUILDING (not unit) and pull 
up this menu:
         A.) If the building can train troops, be able to select a 
troop that will be immediately built, when the game starts (be able 
to choose whether the building of this troop takes any resources or 
not). if there is queuing, be able to choose how many of this troop 
are being built.
         B.)  Be able to choose if this building can be infested.
         C.)  If the building can attack, be able to choose how much 
ammo it has.
         D.) Be able to give the building a command (this would most 
likely just be for the terrans, and the command would be to move 
somewhere.)
         
         

     Thats pretty much it for now.  If some of these suggestions have 
been said before, then the person gets full credit :) I'll post more 
later.
