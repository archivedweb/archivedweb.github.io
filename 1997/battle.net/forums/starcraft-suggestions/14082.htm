<pre>From the hundreds of maps I created in your excellent game, Warcraft 
II, I found a few little problems that kept bugging me. I really 
enjoy working with AI allies, and not just by myself. I can do this, 
as U know, By turning AI players to RESCUE(ACTIVE). But, Although the 
Cpu does work with me in that case, it doesn`t work with other rescue 
actives and they just beat each other up till death instead of the 
enemy. I can almost solve this by putting them in different sides of 
the map, but the rescues have an annoying habit of coming to the 
player`s camp and only then searching for enemy Ai`s. Furthermore, 
the &#34;sea attack&#34; Ai`s empty their mines completely before 
they ever go seafering, and that can take...well, up to and including 
the defeat of all enemy Ai`s. Therefore, if it`s not too late 
already, There is nothing I would appreciate more in starcraft map 
editor then an &#34;Ally&#34; option in Ai`s setting, in a way that 
all allied ai`s will work together with the player, and 
independently(from their base, not coming to the player base first) 
against enemy AI`s. Furthermore, I hope U noticed that custom Ai`s 
tend to build farms which block their way to their mines and then get 
stuck and stop developing, effectively eliminating them from the 
competition. I hope U will read this and/or consider my polite and 
humble request. Thanks in advance and congratulations on creating 
such a great list of superb games.
