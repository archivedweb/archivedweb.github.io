&#62; I think the three races will balance out pretty well in one-on-one 
&#62; battles, but I wonder how things would work out in larger multiplayer 
&#62; games.  For example assuming that allies were using the same race I 
&#62; would rank them as such:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Protoss (strongest)
&#62; 2.  Zerg
&#62; 3.  Terran
&#62; 
&#62; In other words a team using all Protoss would be very difficult to 
&#62; defeat in my opinion if they work well together to produce units.  An 
&#62; an all Zerg team would obviously be terrifying due to sheer numbers.  
&#62; An all Terran team?  I don't know if they'd be as intimidating.
&#62; 
&#62; Now I know all of this is speculation since the beta isn't out but it 
&#62; does bring up the point that the racial balance might be much more 
&#62; difficult to maintain as more human players join in the battle.  I'd 
&#62; appreciate comments on what a good team would be (i.e., which races 
&#62; make the best combo) and how you feel about the rankings above.

    You make a good point but your confusing player skill with the 
unit power.  If a team of great Protoss players are in a game against 
other mediocer players of course they're going to win, because their 
good.  Its true that the number of Zerg on a team would be 
intimidating but thats the point of the Zerg, power in numbers.  I 
personally think a team of Terrans would be the most intimidating 
though, because you can't be sure exactly where they are at any one 
time.  With mobline buildings the Terrans could leave the second you 
discovered a base and you wouldn't know until they were gone.  Think 
about this, your in a six player game, two people of each race,your 
Protoss, all are good players.  The Zerg are pumping out a huge army, 
the Protoss are keeping an eye on the Zerg and hunting the Terrans 
down, but the two Terrans keep moving their bases around, and at any 
minute you could have a barracks landing just outside your defense 
range and starts pumping out goliaths.  Without a network of spies 
across the map, you don't know where the Terrans are at any given 
time, I don't know about you but that intimidates me.  Now the 
Protoss are intimidating because of their powerful units, which are 
fewer than any one elses, I can see why a team of Protoss would be 
thought more powerful but a group of just as many Terrans or Zerg 
with players on the same skill level will be just as powerful. 
Besides all this you left out the one team that would be the most 
terrifing, a mixture of all three.  Think about it, the power of the 
Protoss, the mobility of the Terrains and the numbers of the Zerg all 
mixed into one team, that  scares me more than any pure team.</pre>
