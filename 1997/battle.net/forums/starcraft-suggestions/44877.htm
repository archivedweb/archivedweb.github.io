<pre>       Ok here's the scoop.  In the game from Activision called Dark 
Reign an interesting feature is included.  here it is:
        
       You are sick and tired or following your builders around 
making sure that they make the most possible buildings as soon as 
possible in the beginning of the game.  With this feature you can 
click on a building then another building and the builder will build 
the buildings consecutively without waiting for another command.  
     EXAMPLE FROM WARCRAFT II:

       You just started a multiplayer game and you dont have to 
follow your peons around.  You simply click on a building and the 
place where it should be built.  So you start building your barracks 
and you decide to plan ahead and choose more buildings in the order 
you prefer and place them where you want.  (The area where you will 
build buildings could be shaded in so that you know you cant build 
buildings there)  So instead of following your peons around you have 
planned ahead and thus able to get to more important matters such as 
defending that grunt rush, and talking with your allie, or sending 
insults to the enemy.



     DONT THINK I AM AN IDIOT!!
 
     Do not think that i am stupid and that I think this is the only 
way to go.  To tell you the truth i am not sure.  Planning ahead does 
take out a little skill that is needed to follow your peons around 
and thus if you are faster then your opponent you could gain a lead.  
I simply wrote this to allow Blizzard (if they like the idea) to 
choose if this option would benefit the game or not.  Personally i 
like the idea but i think it best to make it an option.  However, 
that could impose a problem with making the computer AI.  Well see 
how you like the idea Blilzzard.  PLEASE RESPOND! i posted earlier 
and noone ever responded.
