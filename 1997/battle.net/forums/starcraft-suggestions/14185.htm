&#62; &#62; I was wondering. Considering how all the races have air units, and 
&#62; &#62; there will be quite a few of them, what sort of things will shoot 
&#62; &#62; air? There should be some sort of AA guns, for all the races. These 
&#62; &#62; should also be about the same for all the races, so as to encourage 
&#62; &#62; land battles. In War2, the balance between air and ground units was 
&#62; &#62; perfectly equal. A large amount of guard towers was more than 
&#62; &#62; necissary to defend against a Gryphon or Dragon assault. I would like 
&#62; &#62; to see the same thing in Starcraft, because if air units are 
&#62; &#62; extremely powerful, then there will be almost no reason to build 
&#62; &#62; ground units, which would lead to a lack of different strategies. A 
&#62; &#62; game with one or two basic strategies (ex. Red Alert) becomes boring 
&#62; &#62; after a while. Please impliment some types of AA guns, or I'm worried 
&#62; &#62; the whole game will become air battles.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; A very good idea, but the guns should be both anti air AND land, like 
&#62; the guard towers were on War2. Many of the ground units use range 
&#62; weapons of a sort... machine guns, missiles, ect., so they'd be able 
&#62; to shoot at the air units, too. That makes things very interesting....
&#62; Keep up the great ideas everyone!
&#62; Solik


    I like the idea of weapons that can only shot at flyers.  You 
could have them do massive damage to flyers more than most of the 
other units.  They would need to be fragile so ground troops could 
destroy them.  This would allow for more strategy: you have to send 
in the ground pounders to clear a path for the flyers but the flyers 
need to clear a path for the ground units.

Just some thoughts,
Cerberus

ps,  ignore any spelling errors,  I just can't spell.</pre>
