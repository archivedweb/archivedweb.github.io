<pre>              Maybe if they were weak, you could have a small chance 
              to capture not kill them. Then you might be able to use 
thier 
              weapons, or get  information by torture. You could hold 
them in a small 
              prison camp.  You could even put up a ranson on very 
important guys. 
              This was  awfully hard to do in war. 2. Everytime i 
tried this i 
              killed what i   wanted to capture. I think it would 
really add to the 
              game if their  were these hostages. Maybe if there was 
enough of them 
              in one prison  they could even break out in an angry 
mob. This really 
              adds to the  game with hostages I think. It would 
really tick poeple 
              off, and  would be fun to do.       Tell me what you 
think of the 
              idea! You  hate it? TELL ME! You love it? TELL ME!

                            THanx for your time, i greatly appretiate 
it.

              This is like the third time (SORRY) (SORRY, SORRY) 
Could somebody  please help me? I want this idea posted when blizzard 
lookes at the fourm. Like 10 - 12. Around there. Just copy this and 
paste it around then in one of your messages. THANX</pre>
