&#62; &#62; Many Infected Codes and Routines On a System that is Oustanding  For

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Personally, I think that Windows is crap!!
&#62; &#62; Mac don't tend to crash as often as Win95
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Do your homework kid!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; BTW, im a viru... I mean a win95 user, and I got a PC and I like 
&#62; &#62; PCs... but not micro$hit. Give me a stable mac O/S anyday!!

&#62; &#62; &#34;Brain? If I got a brain? WHAT THE HELL IS A BRAIN??&#34;

&#62; You suck, IBMs rule.My freind had a mack and he had to reboot 
&#62; everytime he turned it on!Windows is easy you just cant be a dumbass 
&#62; to use it.

    &#34;Your friend has a Mac and he had to reboot it everytime he 
turned it on?&#34; OK...I almost never see Macs do that, but your 
friend either has 

a) an extensions conflict or
b) a hardware problem or

  If 'b', take it in and get it fixed. If 'a', go to the Extensions 
Manager and turn off half of your Extensions, then re-start. If the 
problem goes away, it's one of those extensions you turned off 
causing it. If not, it's one of the extensions still ON causing it. 
Turn on all the extensions you know are innocent, and keep repeating 
the process until you narrow it down to the extension that's hosing 
his system. Should take all of 10 minutes if you know what you're 
doing. And Extensions conflicts are just about the WORST thing that 
can happen to you with the Mac...ask PC owners if they've had probs 
that took longer than 10 minuts to solve...

  Btw, I use Win 3.1, 95, AND the Mac OS, and I'd have to say that 
Macs definitely crash less often than Win 95 (so does Win3.1, 
actually). And almost EVERYTIME I use Netscape with Win95, the 
program crashes. Microsoft: &#34;Where do you want to crash 
today?&#34;
