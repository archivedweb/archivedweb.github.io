<pre>Blizzard has said it dozens of times.  I've said it dozens of times 
(but, of course, who listens to little-ol me?)  STARCRAFT DOES NOT 
HAVE A RELEASE DATE YET.  NEVER HAS.  Don't listen to anyone but 
Blizzard.

Many people complain about Blizzard's choice of not giving a release 
date.  EVERYONE does this.  The almighty Microsoft even does this.  
Apogee/3D Realms does the same (Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior were going 
to be released 'when it was ready'.)  Blizzard made that mistake 
once... giving a release date that they were unable to meet.  They 
will not do it again.  They prefer for people to be frustrated and 
not know, and to have their game and them be happy, rather than say 
&#34;It will be ready on XX date&#34;, failing to meet the deadline, 
and people whining and complaining... &#34;You said it was going to 
be released!  You liars!  You suck!&#34;  Geez people... chill out 
and wait.  If Blizzard has proven anything, it's that their games are 
worth the wait.

Once more for those hard of hearing (or seeing, I guess. :) ) THERE 
IS NO SPECIFIC RELEASE DATE.  It is naive for anyone to think that 
another company like EB would know the release date before Blizard. ;)
