&#62; &#62; &#62; On the main page it said that TA crushed the competition, but that SC 
&#62; &#62; &#62; and DR pulled out plenty of votes.  I was there when we passed TA, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; but quickly saw somebody coming to Cavedog's aid.  (No fair, one 
&#62; &#62; &#62; ballot box stuffer at a time :)  We had about 2400 (a little less) 
&#62; &#62; &#62; when I went to bed.  I don't know how TA would have &#34;crushed&#34; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; SC, but apparently Meccaworld thinks it did.

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Actually, considering SC isn't even out yet, it did pretty well.  
&#62; &#62; This brings up a new point: why the hell would you vote for a game 
&#62; &#62; that hasn't even come out yet?  C'mon, remember the hype surrounding 
&#62; &#62; Outpost before its release?  There were tons of maniacal fans who 
&#62; &#62; were claiming it the game of the year without even playing it.  Guess 
&#62; &#62; what happened...yup, a lot of dissappointed idiots.  Now before you 
&#62; &#62; lynch me, I'm just using Outpost to illustrate a point; I'm NOT 
&#62; &#62; saying SC will be as bad.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; It is because the people here are morons, and would think Starcrap is 
&#62; the best RTS even if it had Monochrome graphics, and 1 unit per side, 
&#62; just because it is made by blizzard.  Everyone else would decide 
&#62; between two games they have played.

Well lets see... I've played War Wind, KKnD, WarCraft, WC2, DR, TA, 
Z, AoE and some others and if I had to choose which was the best it 
would be WC2.  And who could make a RTS game better than WC2 other 
than Blizzard?  We are not blindly following Blizzard, but we have no 
reason to believe that SC won't be great.  They had WC2 which won 
game of the year, and Diablo which won game of the year.  Why 
shouldn't we have faith in a company that we know can make great 
games?</pre>
