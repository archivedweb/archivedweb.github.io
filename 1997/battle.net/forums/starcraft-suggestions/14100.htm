&#62; Hi, I dont think that this has been suggested yet, 
&#62; 
&#62; You know what ticked me off about war2?  Your main building (Castle, 
&#62; Stronghold) was that, real castles had all sorts of defences (just 
&#62; look at those big towers, those were meant for archers!).  Well, I 
&#62; think it would be a good idea for starcraft, if you could have units 
&#62; &#34;defend&#34; a building,  like, in war2, the town hall could have 
&#62; held 5 units to defend it, the keep 10, and the castle 15.  Another 
&#62; thought on this idea, is that the zerg can &#34;infest&#34; a 
&#62; building, since each zerg unit wont be that  powerful, make it so 
&#62; that more zerg can infest a building than terran or protoss.  Or 
&#62; maybe, instead of units, you could have weapon systems built in to 
&#62; buildings, like defensive lazer turrets.  I think that these ideas 
&#62; should only be implemented on the town hall (whatever the S.C. 
&#62; equavalent of that will be), and maybe on other important building 
&#62; (barracks, maybe?)  
&#62; Please tell me what you think, I really want to know if it is good or 
&#62; if it sucks
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62;

   I think that is a pretty awesome idea :)  It wouldn't be very hard 
for them to make the town hall hold troops, just use the programming 
for transports, really.  It would be cool if you could click on the 
town hall and see the portraits of the troops inside, and choose to 
send them out one at a time, or in a group. There should be 
limitations, however: a goliath is too tall to fit in, but marines 
will go nicely, or something.  Here is another suggestion, regarding 
the weapons systems and stuff:  When you first build the town hall, 
it is weak, but mobile.  You can upgrade it to the (equivalent) of a 
keep, adding strength and keeping mobility.  THEN, you can choose to 
upgrade it to the (equivalent) castle, and that is when the fun 
starts, :)  The tank treads are retracted, and shielding goes up 
around it.  The castle is very strong, but immobile.  THEN, since 
they are already planning to have structures that can fuse together 
or connect (science wing, and such), you could choose to add a cannon 
tower on the northwest corner, a fusion turret on the south east 
corner, and so on.  It would be cool if the castle could go on 
forever, in a way, as you expand on it and add defensive and 
offensive structures.  Maybe you could connect it with a barracks, 
and then the castle could hold more troops.  It would almost balance 
itself out, because you could opt for a weaker, but movable, 
stronghold, or you could choose to stay in one spot, and over time, 
create an almost impenetrable structure.

   Please reply with questions/comments/whatever
