<pre>All of what you say is true, but the fact that it could be done is 
still there.  I never said the maps would be &#34;good&#34; scms, i 
just said that it was possible, and it was also a decent suggestion.
Are my flames really that so good that people are honored by them?

&#62; Wow! My flame was counter flamed by running onion! I feel so 
&#62; priveledged. I understand what you are saying, but almost none of the 
&#62; resources are going to be the same. The way all the units work in 
&#62; Starcraft compared to Warcraft is completely different. The puds from 
&#62; warcraft probable wouldn't make very well for strategy in starcraft. 
&#62; Besides, all the units are completely different. It would just be too 
&#62; difficult to make a converter. Even if there was a converter, to make 
&#62; the battles better you will have to almost recreate the whole 
&#62; scenerio, which defeats the purpose. Do you follow what I am saying? 
&#62; The converter would almost be counter-productive.

&#62; &#62; Scroll up to the top of the forum and what do you see?  a sign that 
&#62; &#62; says &#34;Starcraft Suggestions&#34;
&#62; &#62; Big Rob came up with a suggestion and suggested it.
&#62; &#62; And it is not impossible.  What are your computer programming 
&#62; &#62; credentials that you declared something impossible??
&#62; &#62; Here is why it is impossible.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; War2, i am almost positive, stores the data in a 2 dimensional array. 
&#62; &#62; right?  like a 128x128 map is a square array with 128 squares on each 
&#62; &#62; side of a grid, creating a coordinate system.  Now, with that in 
&#62; &#62; mind, you can find out the coordinates of every square on the map and 
&#62; &#62; what is located on that square.  (this is all really easy to do) for 
&#62; &#62; instace, in the box 67x45 there is a tree which is represented by the 
&#62; &#62; number 4 (i don't know what the real numbers are, this is just an 
&#62; &#62; example of how the data would be stored, maybe 1 for water, 2 for 
&#62; &#62; unbuildable land, 3 for buildable land, etc)  Then you could read in 
&#62; &#62; the coordinates for each square on the map (the pud file) and then 
&#62; &#62; you place a similar object in the coresponding area of a scm file.  
&#62; &#62; the gold mines could transfer into gas mines, etc.  and the trees 
&#62; &#62; could translate into sc trees.  It doesn't need to be a 1-to-1 
&#62; &#62; translation the map surface, for instance it would ignore oil 
&#62; &#62; deposits and just put water onto the corresponding area on the scm.  
&#62; &#62; The coordinates don't even have to be the same, just a translation of 
&#62; &#62; them with a math formula (easy to do).  The resulting scm file would 
&#62; &#62; only be on 1 level, and you might have to touch it up manually a 
&#62; &#62; little so all the different resources are included, but it is not 
&#62; &#62; impossible.
&#62; &#62; Think before you flame.  And even if it was impossible at least it 
&#62; &#62; shows that Big Rob is thinking and using this forum for what is was 
&#62; &#62; meant, suggestions.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There i am done now

&#62; &#62; &#62; The reason why no one has suggested it yet is because it is 
&#62; &#62; &#62; impossible!!! not only does starcraft use different resources, but 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the lasat is completely different. for one thing, War2 has no hills, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; and no cliffs!! It is completely flat! Starcraft has hills, gullies, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; vallies, and all other geographical things. Thats not even including 
&#62; &#62; &#62; that some maps aren't even set on a planet!!!!!
