<blockquote>
<pre>Please answer the following or post a reply stating that they are 
being saved for the uberlist. I have posted them before but noone 
responded.

1 ) Playing the zerg, if my terran opponent abandons auxillary 
structures by moving his primary structure elsewhere, are the 
auxillary structures themselves infestable or are only primary 
structures infestiable?

2 )  if creep is destroyable, and all creep around a zerg building is 
destroyed EXCEPT the building itself is left intact, will the 
building create more creep and eventually redevelop the destroyed 
creep? Or will the creep-destroyed area be rendered permenantly 
uncreepable (sorta like nuclear meltdowns creating uninhabitable 
areas in Sim City)?
   a) If Terrans order a nuclear strike at a zerg area, assumedly 
       the creep there would be destroyed. As this more closely 
       resembles the circumstances of that Sim City meltdown 
       allusion, do nuked areas become uninhabitable to the zerg 
       (creep) or other races? Or does nuking have solely a damage 
       effect?

3 ) Does creep have hit points and armour levels? Is there a 
quantifable amount of damage creep does to non-zerg standing on it 
(beyond that generated by the attacks of the lurker) and a 
quantifiable amount of damage it can take before it is destroyed? If 
so, can creep hit points/armour level/attack effects be upgraded?

4 ) If a terran unit was left standing right next to creep (but not 
on it), and if that unit was ignored by its player, could the creep 
eventually 'creep' under him? Or would it surround him but not be 
under him?

5 ) Likewise, would that unit in the above question automatically 
attack creep that comes in range of his weapons systems? 

6 ) Can lurkers strike at units adjacent to creep or must the unit be 
physically on it? Moreover, can lurkers attack flying units hovering 
or traveling over creep?

7 ) When creep is attacked, does the zerg player get a zerg-
equivalent  'our town is under attack' sound warning? Or does that 
only occur when actual zerg buildings are attacked?

8 ) How are building relocation commands handled? I mean, if I order 
my structure to move to point B (at the time of the order
point B is clear of creep, other units, trees and obstacles), but in 
transit some foreign unit (or my own) comes to occupy that landing 
space, will the structure automatically land in the space nearest to 
point B that is available? Will it return automatically to its take 
off point?   Will it hover above point B until it receives an 
explicit new landing location or until point B is cleared off again?

9 ) Do any Terran buildings have defense systems that continue to (or 
solely) operate while the building is in-flight?

10 ) Do power stations continue to generate power while they are in 
flight? (Assumedly they would as their solar cells are still
absorbing solar energy). 
     a) If they dont function, do anchored buildings suffer 
         power outtages while power stations move?
      b) If they function, why would I ever want to land them (and 
           be vulnerable to land and air attack) when I could set 
           them flying along an endless path of waypoints (or 
           patroll) perhaps over trees or water so that they are 
           vulnerable by air only?

11 ) Part b above leads to the next rational question: Are there 
limitations on building movement capacity? That is, can a building be 
in the air for only 'x' seconds (maybe it has only 'y' amount of 
fuel) such that it has no choice but to land? Or, on the other hand, 
can buildings remain airborn indefinately?

12 ) I assume the blue rift that appears in one of the screenshots is 
a protos building in-progress (being teleported from protos 
homeworld). Is this correct? Can units attack the 'blue rift' and 
damage the transporting building?

13) Is building-teleportation near instantaneous or is there a 
comperable 'phase in' period simular to teran building construction 
time and zerg building gestation time?
      a) What of protos units? Are their teleportation from the
           homeworld upon demand near instantaneous?

14 ) Assuming all races have one sort or another of 'building time' 
associated with building new buildings, are any of the races given a 
particular advantage in having particularly fast build-times relative 
to the other races? Or are the three races fairly equal relative to 
eachother and the complexity of the building being built?

15 ) If Protos have teleportation technology, one would think they 
could teleport units directly into enemy encampments/behind enemy 
defenses. How is it rationalized that they can not? If the answer 
involves the need of a pre-existing structure to be the target of the 
telportation, how does the first Protos structure (I assume the 
Nexus) get to a given planet considering no pre-existing structures 
existed for it to teleport to?

16 ) Can orders be erased from a unit's order que out of order?  
Meaning, if I have qued 6 orders to some unit production facility 
(the 3rd of which is to produce a firebat), and I decide I no longer 
wish to produce that firebat, can I delete/change the 3rd order 
without altering the surrounding orders in the que? For that matter, 
can you expand on how flexible the que is to alteration?

17 ) On unit movement/interaction with buildings: In warcraft2 one 
could inadvertently build unit 'traps' where newly constructed units 
are surrounded by buildings/natural obstacles and cannot get out. 
Simmularly, peons at times found themselves trapped after building 
new buildings. Has this bug (in my opinion -- as it is very 
unrealistic) been dealt with in starcraft? Assumedly buildings would 
have walking spaces inside them and surrounding them inherant to its 
space through which units can move -- not needing to be manually 
maintaned by the player. I suppose the question is, can small ground 
units travel between two buildings built adjacent to eachother?

18 ) Considering wood no longer is a resource, I assume it is still 
possible to clear trees and the like to make room for building 
expansion? 
  a)Can any unit attack/destroy terrain or does that require special 
     units? What terrain can be altered/destroyed and what cannot? Do 
     terrain features have hit-point equivalency or is it more like 
'one 
     shot destroys it' type of thing?
   b)Can Terran SCV's and Protos shuttles be ordered to build 
     buildings on forested areas (rationally speaking, especially in 
the 
     future, one would think SCV's and shuttles could handle routine 
tree-
     clearing to prep a space for a building they are creating).
     If they can't, what's the logic? I can't see how advanced races 
     couldn't figure out how to get rid of trees without breaking a 
sweat.

19 ) So far, the only mention of exploding units have been biproducts 
of defilers and possibly infested terrans. Do exploding units do 
damage to terrain features?

20 ) Is there any way to alter terrain (in actual gameplay) to 
produce bridges between levels? For example, can you do something 
like walk an exploding unit up to a cliff such that when it explodes 
it collapses some of the cliff face making a 'ramp' linking the lower 
level to that at the cliff's top? 

21 ) Age of Empires, etc all have hotkeys for grouping units, but 
I've found (in AoE and Warcraft II) it would likewise be useful to be 
able to set hotkeys or have commands for particular unit FORMATIONS. 
Such that 'group objects' (pardon the object orientedness of the 
question) would have their own formation commands/functions that 
isolated units would not have. Does Starcraft attempt to deal with 
this in any way or will this have to wait for the likes of Warcraft 
III and other post-starcraft cutting edge RTS games?

22) Suggestion: I know this sounds silly and slightly absurd, but I 
strongly suggest the addition of a peon equivalent hero or two!! Not 
only for the huge potential comic element of having a 
superpeon/scv/shuttle/drone, but also because it makes a bold 
statement and could augment gameplay.. a 'superpeon' might have 
significantly increased 'building' rates and 'gathering' capacity. 

23 ) Battlenet question. Is there any way to 'reset' your statistics 
or are they permenant? Likewise is there any way to 'delete' your 
username from the Battlenet annals (besides through it happening 
automatically do to inactivity)? Logic being if I wanted to start 
anew with my current name and there was no reset function I'd delete 
myself and re-register the same username immediately after. 

24 ) Also on Battlenet. While tracking wins-losses-disconnects is 
certainly a nifty way of assessing opponents, its limitted in that it 
reflects overall historical data (assumedly including the user's 
newbie games) as opposed to adequately expressing his current 
ability. That is, if Lothar has 50 wins and 50 losses, I have no idea 
if he's an average player who wins half the time or a kick-ass player 
who lost his first 50 games but has won every one since. Does 
Battlenet also provide 'Last 10 games' information (or anything 
simular, like providing dates with wins/losses) from which I can see 
the results of a potential opponent's RECENT forays and assess his 
CURRENT ability?

25 ) How do you decide which questions to answer, which to ignore, 
and which to save for the uberlists? Is there a certain criteria you 
use? I ask because I've posted these questions before but they were 
not responded to -- either with explicit answers or statements 
suggesting they would be answered in the next uberlist.</pre>
