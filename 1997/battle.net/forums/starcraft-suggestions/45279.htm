<pre>&#62; I might be wrong but Total Annihalition, Dark Reign, Conquest Earth, 
&#62; War Wind and a whole bundle of RTS games came out before AoE...Did I 
&#62; go for the first thing available...Nope....I went for a winner...

You apparently didnt wait long enough, i dont think starcraft is out
yet :) 
 
&#62; Well, I have to tell you....not many of the tribes on AoE play the 
&#62; same.....Granted most the units look alike, but the buildings do not. 
&#62;  Each geographical region represented in the game has a distinct look.

Ok, not the same, but similarily....
There are 3 geographical locations. And three races in starcraft
i think i'd rather totally different races, then just different looks
for the buildings. &#60;but its not a bad feature&#62;
 
&#62; Hmmm...I like how they are &#34;discussing&#34; random maps and 
&#62; &#34;supposedly&#34; already has quite a few map types.  Makes me 
&#62; feel confident in buying their game.

Well, i am quite sure that they have different map types, but i didnt
want to commit to saying that &#34;there are&#34;
as for random maps, i find that one person always gets screwed for
resources....

&#62; Ah, you don't need all of them, but they are there depending on what 
&#62; strategy you are going to take.  If you are doing an island pud, 
&#62; there are alot of upgrades you won't use or will use late in the 
&#62; game, but there are a compliment of upgrades that will help you in 
&#62; that island game.  Just the fact that so many options are there is 
&#62; what makes it unique.


 
&#62; You know, when I go thru the drive thru at McDonalds, I don't say, 
&#62; &#34;Hey, could you put my food in a bag?&#34;.  But every damn time 
&#62; they give me my food in a bag..........

well, thats only so its easier for you to get home, less spills in the
car, and an overall happier customer....

as for me, i'm not so concerned about repeat business :)

&#62; Exactly, that's why I waited thru the releases of Dark Reign, 
&#62; Conquest Earth, M.A.X., War Wind, Total Annilhalation, Dark Colony, 
&#62; etc. until a good RTS came out.  AoE is IT...

AoE is a decent game... but i still prefer warcraft two over it, and
i sure hope &#60;and am fairly certain&#62; that, starcraft will be 
much
better...

&#62; Mr. Softy
&#62; -Why do people waste their time in forums for games that won't be 
&#62; released for months, when they could be doing some serious 
&#62; gaming...Hey, what am I doing here?  :)

Exactly, one of the biggest problems with forums, are ppl that waste
their time posting in them that &#34;this game sux&#34;, or &#34;GAME-
X is gonna
wipe the floor w/ StarCraft....
