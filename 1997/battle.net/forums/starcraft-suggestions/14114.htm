&#62; &#62; Hi, I dont think that this has been suggested yet, 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You know what ticked me off about war2?  Your main building (Castle, 
&#62; &#62; Stronghold) was that, real castles had all sorts of defences (just 
&#62; &#62; look at those big towers, those were meant for archers!).  Well, I 
&#62; &#62; think it would be a good idea for starcraft, if you could have units 
&#62; &#62; &#34;defend&#34; a building,  like, in war2, the town hall could have 
&#62; &#62; held 5 units to defend it, the keep 10, and the castle 15.  Another 
&#62; &#62; thought on this idea, is that the zerg can &#34;infest&#34; a 
&#62; &#62; building, since each zerg unit wont be that  powerful, make it so 
&#62; &#62; that more zerg can infest a building than terran or protoss.  Or 
&#62; &#62; maybe, instead of units, you could have weapon systems built in to 
&#62; &#62; buildings, like defensive lazer turrets.  I think that these ideas 
&#62; &#62; should only be implemented on the town hall (whatever the S.C. 
&#62; &#62; equavalent of that will be), and maybe on other important building 
&#62; &#62; (barracks, maybe?)  
&#62; &#62; Please tell me what you think, I really want to know if it is good or 
&#62; &#62; if it sucks
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks,

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;    I think that is a pretty awesome idea :)  It wouldn't be very hard 
&#62; for them to make the town hall hold troops, just use the programming 
&#62; for transports, really.  It would be cool if you could click on the 
&#62; town hall and see the portraits of the troops inside, and choose to 
&#62; send them out one at a time, or in a group. There should be 
&#62; limitations, however: a goliath is too tall to fit in, but marines 
&#62; will go nicely, or something.  Here is another suggestion, regarding 
&#62; the weapons systems and stuff:  When you first build the town hall, 
&#62; it is weak, but mobile.  You can upgrade it to the (equivalent) of a 
&#62; keep, adding strength and keeping mobility.  THEN, you can choose to 
&#62; upgrade it to the (equivalent) castle, and that is when the fun 
&#62; starts, :)  The tank treads are retracted, and shielding goes up 
&#62; around it.  The castle is very strong, but immobile.  THEN, since 
&#62; they are already planning to have structures that can fuse together 
&#62; or connect (science wing, and such), you could choose to add a cannon 
&#62; tower on the northwest corner, a fusion turret on the south east 
&#62; corner, and so on.  It would be cool if the castle could go on 
&#62; forever, in a way, as you expand on it and add defensive and 
&#62; offensive structures.  Maybe you could connect it with a barracks, 
&#62; and then the castle could hold more troops.  It would almost balance 
&#62; itself out, because you could opt for a weaker, but movable, 
&#62; stronghold, or you could choose to stay in one spot, and over time, 
&#62; create an almost impenetrable structure.
&#62; 
&#62;    Please reply with questions/comments/whatever
&#62; 
&#62;                                                     Ugly the Cute

Yeah!  I like ALL those ideas!  especially about the keep and kastle 
(kind of) balancing out.   I hope that this is included.
