<pre>Lets look at the facts...
   Some people dont want superweapons
   Some people want superweapons
   Some have better things to do other than starcraft and havent post
Ok, now lets look at a perfect model, Real War
Superweapons(Nukes, Chemicals Warheads, Biological Warheads...) in 
real war have been used.  2 Nukes have been fired during wartime at 
Japan and that made them surrender real quick.  Some crazy lunatics 
have used chemical weapons etc...  What im trying to say is that how 
unconventional they are, they are used.  Blizzard, please dont make 
superweapons that do horrible damage.  I fired a nuke in RA and it 
didnt even blow up a tank.  A TANK!!!! just a measily peice of 
vaporized metal in a real nuclear blast, but more like i hit it with 
a riflemen.  RA's philosiphy sucked.  Superweapons SHOULD do 
superdamage, but at high costs.  Ill take a nuke for example cause i 
love mushroomclouds.  Lets say a terran player builds a nuclear 
warhead.  He should, under proper war, threaten the other players 
first saying if they do not withdraw there forces they will be 
attacked by the nuke.  BUT... This is Battle.net, there are going to 
be loosers that just fire it so lets take that scenario, the guy just 
fires it as soon as its ready.  While the nuke is in orbit, THE 
PROTOSS ACTIVATED THERE ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM and blow it out of the 
sky.  While the terran has spend a long time building and preping the 
nuke, all wasted.  This would discourage people from using these 
weapons.  But, if the protoss player is ignerant and forgets to do 
this, he should be punished.  How?  by turning his base into a 
glowing cinder.  The nuke should be a huge explosion that will take 
out just about everything in its path, except one thing... the 
ignerant player built bunkers.  Bunkers could be a building that 
could be build that you can put, say, five units in.  The bunker 
would only be slightly damgaged by layers and layers of protoss 
concrete and that gold stuff you always see them wear.  The protoss 
inside would not be hurt at all.  And then you might think about AH 
OH, THe RADIATION!!!! AHHHH... And pee in your pants.  Well, after 
considering this(and changing pants a few times) i thought about what 
the guys used in the zerg cut scene.  Cold Fusion.  Fusion is not 
Fission.  Fission leaves behind alot of radiation while fusion, well 
truthfully only leaves behind water and helium.  Really... So, have 
super weapons that do super damage, just put a prevention mechanism 
for each race and a mechanism to help them out if they do get hit.
I have another idea considering nukes(fiesty little missiles arent 
they)  fake bases.  I think that you should be able to build fake 
structures where your base was, of corse moving your base to another 
location.  And then plant underground nukes all in and around your 
base(small ones).  Then when the zerg comes, unsuspecting any 
resistance, they attack your base.  And you give your Ghost 
permission to push the button and KABOOM!!!! The zergs army is dead 
and your base is saftly away.  Just an idea for a stratagy.  Later
