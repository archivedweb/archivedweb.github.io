<pre>        Ok i know some of you have realised that the Zerg are VERY 
similar to the Tyranids of Warhammer 40K. For those of you who dont 
know its a cool table top war game that i would encourage you to 
check out. Anyway when they made the tyranids they gave them the 
option of bio upgrades. These were cool little upgrades equivelent to 
the Space marines(hmmm kinda like terrans) war gear cards. The bio 
upgrades included things like a voltage field it was a cool shield 
that emminated from the tyrands body it not only protected but also 
had the ability to short out the enemys shields(cool huh). They also 
had the Acid blood  bio upgrade so when they died they could kill 
their killer(again very cool). They also had things like hardened 
carapace that acted as an better armor. They had one called the Aura 
of Torment which brought massive fear to the enemys within close 
proximity of the tyrinid w/ that upgrade. Another cool upgrade was 
flesh hooks these were hooks connected to the tyranids chest that 
shot out i believe it was about 20 feet they then connected to an 
enemy(maybe a lil terran hehe) and dragged the poor screaming marine 
to the a grusome death ny the Tyranid. The last one ill mention will 
be the Null Zone this was an area around the tyranid where ALL psycic 
attacks had a 50&#37; chance of being countered in other words they 
didnt work HAHA. Please excuse my spelling and please give me some 
feedback.

PS. There is also a tyranid unit called a Lictor i unfortunatly cant 
find my codex so will some 40k'er please tell people about the 
Lictor(Hive Tyrant maybe hmmm) I think he would be cool for the Zerg.

PPS please keep in mind i dont think the zerg should be exactly like 
the tyranids i just think the Nids had good ideas and maybe Blizzard 
should think on em.

                                   A Big Bliz Fan,
                                   ISAM</pre>
