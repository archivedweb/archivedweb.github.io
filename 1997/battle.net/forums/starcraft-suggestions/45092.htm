&#62; An adventure game from Blizzard? Point and click adventure. Boring!!! 
&#62; For the many of us RTS fans who enjoy Blizzard games, how many of us 
&#62; do you expect would go out and buy a crappy adventure game? Adventure 
&#62; games and RPGs don't last long. Once you finish an adventuer game 
&#62; once, it would be put away for good and no one would ever touch it 
&#62; again. Adventure games don't have replayability or multiplayer 
&#62; support so who the hell would bother? Once you've finished it, if you 
&#62; were to ever play it again, you would already know exactly what to 
&#62; do. No fun, no thinking required. I wish Blizzard would cancel their 
&#62; work on Warcraft Adventures and use their valuable time (which they 
&#62; are currently wasting on Warcraft Adventures) to make new and better 
&#62; games (e.g. Warcraft III) or finish off some games (e.g. Starcraft). 
&#62; I mean what is the point of making WA, apart from the storyline 
&#62; linking to War3? Who would buy it? Apart from those idiots out there 
&#62; who think WA IS Warcraft 3.
&#62; 
&#62; I know this is not the place to talk about this, but since I've 
&#62; started, who cares. Diablo 2? What happened to diablo 1 better not 
&#62; happen to diablo 2. Please tell the Diablo team (I dont want to waste 
&#62; a message posting the diablo forum then waiting another 2 hours to 
&#62; post again) to make Diablo 2 TOTALLY bug and cheat free. That means 
&#62; no duping or hacks. Have more options to fight the lag too. Have a 
&#62; menu option when launching a game so there is a maximum ping 
&#62; requirement. For example, you can set max ping: 700 so that no one 
&#62; with higher ping than 700 can join. I finished diablo in single 
&#62; player the day after I got it. I played over battle.net and with 
&#62; others, experienced all the cheaters and laggers and pkers. Killed 
&#62; diablo 20 times. Got bored of it within a month and never played it 
&#62; again. How short lived. If I had a wish, I'd wish Blizzard would skip 
&#62; Diablo 2 and warcraft adventures.


Some people love these games. Possible you don't, but people have 
different taste you know.. So you mean Blizzard should do nothing 
else than RTS games?? &#34;Yeah, that's right, 'cause that's what 
they're good at&#34; - I hear you say. Yes, I agree, but how do you 
know that they're not good at other game styles? And I can't believe 
that you said that RPG's don't last long! You're wrong there dude! 
Possibly that you got a good character in Diablo quite fast, though, 
your character can still get better, I'm sure of that. Though I agree 
with that RTS games have longer durability, but RPG's are not far 
away.. so you want every gamecompany in the whole world to make only 
RTS's? Wow, then those games would get fun after 20 years..
So stop this bullshit saying they should do no more than RTS's!
And how do you explain that people still play Angband from 1984? (RPG 
with no graphics at all)
How do you explain that MUDs are welcome by many? How do you explain 
that Diablo sold in 13 million ex? (Think it was 13 million, and just 
imagine how many piracy versions that's out there..) Why do you think 
people are waiting for Diablo 2? That's cause they want those games, 
so stop this nonsense! You want RTS games? Fine, then buy those and 
leave the other games alone if you like..</pre>
