<pre>Since I'm bored and I have 2 posts that I haven't used, I might as 
well show you some of the advantages the others have.

Terran mechs, they are the strongest Terran forces, or we assume so, 
and what are their weapons?  Missles, and Machine guns, we've seen 
from screen shots that they have no actual melee weapon.  So 
basically if they can't keep a distance then they're at a loss.

Second, say there is a research laboratory, it can move all right, 
and it can have wings to research biological stuff like that.  
Problem: the wings will get left behind should the lab find the need 
to move.  So don't go thinking that the whole Terran base could 
suddenly sneak up behind you or anything.  Yes I read these in a 
reputable computer magazine in case you're going to ask.

Keep stuff like this in mind.

The Zerg will have absolutely NO long range weapons, and I'm sure 
you've seen pictures of the hydralisk and Ultralisk.  They have big 2 
foot long blades for arms, and it is been noted in the mags and 
previews so far that the Zerg will have the highest melee attack of 
every race, in addition to the fact that they will be the most 
numerous.

Now go back to Warcraft, take 9 upgraded rangers, and 9 upgraded 
ogres, and tell me which group would survive?  The ogres hands down.  
Of course the rangers would be a bit more powerful, and the ogres 
would be slightly less powerful, but just bear with me on this.

You stated that the Terrans will be able to cloak themselves?  Well 
that's not how I heard it to tell the truth.  Take a look at those 
Protoss.  What race of aliens from what movie do they remind you of?

hint: Predator

Yes, and remember the cool cloaking ability they had?  It wasn't 
total invisibility as there would be a very slight ripply affect 
around them but the idea is the same.  You can't tell where, or how 
many there are.

Throckmorton is right when he says the Pylons and uplink(?) will 
probably have upwards of 1000hp or thereabout, kinda like the dark 
portal in War2.

As for creep, I am confused by what people are posting about it on 
this forum.  What the creep is from what I understand is, there is a 
main hive and the creep gradually seeps outward in a circle from the 
hive, and as enough ground is covered, you can build more buildings 
on it.  In my opinion a very imaginative way to keep the Zerg from 
building up so fast.  After all, why would they need resources?

The Protoss will almost undoubtedly have some sort of BLOODLUST, in 
fact that was confirmed, simply having a large group cast lust on a 
single unit and having it a nearly invincible killer for a time.  
They may also have some sort of shield ala Independance Day that is 
castable on their units and possibly buildings (hint important 
buildings).

But when it comes down to it, you can't really know because it all 
comes down to the stats of the individual units.  If the mechs are 
about as powerful as the present day peons, and the dragoons more 
like juggernauts, well Terrans will get wasted so bad, it's awful to 
think about.</pre>
