Well, it's the second &#34;Cruddymag&#34; and boy have I got some 
surprises for you.  Surprise!  I'm not really going to have anything 
this time!  Hehe, just kidding.  I've got an interview with Farmer 
Fred about food, a rhyme about food, and the first part of a three 
part story about food! Bon Appetite!

An Interview With Farmer Fred
-----
CB - Cruddy Buddy
FF - Farmer Fred
-----
CB: I shar doo thank ya fer lettin we talk to yar today!
FF: You're welcome, I'm glad I could be here.  But I'm a farmer you 
know, not a hick.
CB: Yikes!  Chill out dude!  I was just kidding.  You don't have to 
go psycho on me!
FF: Could we continue please?  I've got a lot of work to do.
CB: What work?!  All you farmers do is sit around all day and watch 
the trees grow!
FF: That is not true young man...
CG: I'm not a man, I'm a critter.
FF: Oh really?  What kind of critter are you?
CB: What kind of farmer are you?
FF: I asked you first!
CB: I asked you second!
FF: Fine, then to answer your question, I am a good farmer.  Now, 
what kind of critter are you?
CB: I am a good critter.
FF: *sigh* You need help.
CB: You need Rogain.
FF: Listen CRITTER!  I agreed to an interview, not to an insult match.
CB: You're right, I'm sorry.  Could we continue please?
FF: Well...I don't know.
CB Pleeeeease?!
FF: OK, but no more silliness.
CB: Kay.  Now, what kind of food do you grow on your farm?
FF: Well, I grow broccoli, bean sprouts, asparagus-
CB: WOAH WOAH WOAH!  Back the chuck wagon up for a minute!
FF: What is it?
CB: I asked you what kind of FOOD you grow here.  Now what kind of 
crap do you grow here.
FF: Are you saying you don't like broccoli?
CB: As a food or as a projectile?
FF: OK, I can see you're not interested in grown items.
CB: What else ya got?
FF: Well, we raise pigs, cattle, chickens, and emu.
CB: Any free samples?
FF: After the interview, we'll go inside for some dinner.
CB: We're done!
FF: With the interview?
CB: Yep!  Let's go eat!
FF: Actually, my wife will not have supper ready for a wee bit longer.
CB: Never mind then.  I've got a question about your emu.
FF: Yes?
CB: Does it taste just like chicken?
FF: Well, some people think it does.  I, for one, think it tastes 
like-
*Cruddy runs over to the emu and attacks it*
FF: Stop!  Leave that emu alone!
CB: Why?  You said he tastes just like chicken!
FF: I know what I said, but you'll have to wait until-
CB: WAIT!
FF: What?
CB: I think I heard your wife say that supper is ready!
FF: Really?  I didn't hear anything.
CB: Uh, yeah!  She said, &#34;Come an get it!&#34;
FF: Really?
CB: Yup!
FF: That's funny, because my wife can't yell.  She always rings the 
dinner bell.
CB: Oh, uhhh... then what's this?!
FF: That's a sweet potato.  You may keep it if you'd like.
CB: Why?
FF: To eat of course!
CB: Does it taste just like chicken?
FF: No, it tastes like a sweet potato.
CB: Is it good?
FF: Of course it's good!  I eat them all of the time!
CB: Uh... sure you do.  If they are so good, then why are you giving 
one to me?
FF: Because I have plenty to share!
CB: Uh hu... sure pal.  I'll just be taking this back to the lab...
*ding ding ding!*

I would have finished the interview... uh, but um... Something 
happened right after the dinner bell rang and I didn't get a chance 
to finish.  Yeah!  That's it!

Steal My Junk and Die You Punk
by Cruddy Buddy

Oreos, Crackerjacks, peanuts, and cake,
Junk food is better than chicken or steak.
I love to eat it all day and all night;
Look at my popcorn and you'll lose your sight!
Touch my chips once and kiss fingers goodbye;
Candy bars, lemon drops, french fries, and pie!

This poem was inspired by my stomach!  You can send him an e-mail at  
cruddybuddy's.stomach@food.4.me.com.  Actually, his account is not 
set up yet, so just send the mail to MY address and I'll print it out 
and make sure he gets it.  *munch munch*

THE STORY OF CHEF BOYARDEE
(Part 1 of 3)
by Cruddy Buddy

Once upon a time, in Italy, there was an quaint, little orphanage on 
the outskirts of Venice.  The orphanage was run by a kindly old nun 
who had been taking care of children for many years.  But, alas, 
because of her age, remembering the names of the children was not as 
easy as it was in years past.  Once day, she came up with a system 
for telling the children apart.  She would call them only by their 
first and last initial.  She called Antonio Monabe, A.M. and little 
Brianna Vizzini, B.V.  This system worked well until new children 
with the same initials came to the orphanage.  So, she took her 
system a step further by calling the children's gender, boy or girl, 
before their initials.

Now, the old lady had arthritis, and so her cooking was not to the 
children's satisfaction.  On one particular day when the food was 
especially bad, a young lad named Richard Denario leaped upon the 
table and proclaimed...

&#34;Suma day!  I will maka all kids love food!&#34;
&#34;YEAH!&#34;
The nun came out of the kitchen to see what the commotion was about.
&#34;Boy R.D.!  You get offa thata table this instant!&#34;
&#34;I promisa you all!  Suma day,  I will maka food that children 
will love!&#34;
To Be Continued...


Well, that's all of the time we have for today.  Join us next time 
when we will explore the possibilities of garbage trucks in space, 
and I will tell you how you can support the &#34;Cruddy Buddy for 
President Campaign&#34;!
Wait a second.  Didn't I tell you that is what we would explore in 
THIS issue?  OK, so Cruddy Buddy is a liar too!  Add THAT to your 
list of &#34;Reasons Cruddy Buddy Sucks&#34;

With Lots of Love For All Foodkind,
Cruddy Buddy
