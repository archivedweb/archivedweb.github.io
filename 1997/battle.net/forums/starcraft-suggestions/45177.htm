<pre>&#62; we are all suffering from is called war2 burn out.  Its like coming 
&#62; off
&#62; the rebound with a woman.  You go for just about the first thing 
&#62; available.
&#62; :)

I had that after the 2nd week of playing that God-awful mouse 
clicking contest.  

 
&#62; Maybe so, but the tribes are all the same, its just some dont get
&#62; certain units, buildings, or upgrades. But as you say, they do all 
&#62; have
&#62; differenct special skills.

the game was meant to simulate HISTORY on EARTH from around 12,000 
B.C. to 500 A.D, and does a damn good job at it.  Civilization on 
Earth was not as radically different form each other, with the 
exception of the Far East, since they all developed near each other.  

&#62; Starcraft on the other hand has three *DIFFERENT* races, they dont 
&#62; look
&#62; the same, or even play the same.

Who cares?  That is not the point of AOE.  The point was to make a 
fun game based on history that needs thinking, not fast mouse 
clicking, to win.  LOTR2, C&C1, and AOE are the only RTS's that need 
strategy, not fast clicking, to win.
 
 
 
 
&#62; thats cause you dont need them all, with a 50 unit cap, you aren't 
&#62; going
&#62; to use a lot of the units &#60;but then again, it depends who's 
&#62; playing&#62;.

More like some upgrades are EXPENSIVE.  Take, for example, Longsword 
to Legion, or Phalanx to Centurion.
 
&#62; &#62; This is where 
&#62; &#62; all the strategy comes in.  You must determine from the multitude of 
&#62; &#62; options, what to spend your resources on.  You must exploit the 
&#62; &#62; strenghts of your tribe while exploiting the weakness of the other 
&#62; &#62; tribes.  What other game can have an 8 multiplayer game, and each 
&#62; &#62; player a different race/tribe?
&#62; 
&#62; Master of orion 2 &#60;you didnt say it had to be RTs&#62;.

MOO2 sucked.  All it was was missile blitz, because a galaxy larger 
enough to prevent this took too long to play.
 
&#62; &#62; None I know of.  Do yourself a 
&#62; &#62; favor....forget about Starcraft and get Age of Empires...It's in 
&#62; &#62; stores now people, unlike Starcraft...
&#62; 
&#62; Thats the one argument i actually agree with, Starcraft is not out.
&#62; If you need a game NOW then get aoe, but often the best experiences
&#62; take the longest time to attain.

Then if Microsoft was lazy, and spent the whole time on break, 
because they had an army of lamers buying their games no matter what, 
they could take forever, and people would use the same argument.</pre>
