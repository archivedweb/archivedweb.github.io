&#62; I have read that when you upgrade a terran building and then move 
&#62; that building the upgrades stay where they are.  Then if another 
&#62; lucky terran player comes along and settles down he can use those 
&#62; upgrades on his own buildings.  Cool idea.  But isn't it a little 
&#62; unfair to protoss and zerg players?  I was wondering if you could let 
&#62; them use it, maybe in strange ways.  One idea for the zerg is to let 
&#62; them simply eat the upgrades to grow stronger faster.  An idea I had 
&#62; for the protoss is an ability human clairvoyants are sometimes 
&#62; purported to have.  Apparently they can touch something and tell 
&#62; exactly where the owner/last person to have touched it is.  Since the 
&#62; protoss have psionic(psychic?) powers how about letting the protoss 
&#62; player touch the upgrade and then have the current position of the 
&#62; terran building revealed?  This would be very cool, especially if the 
&#62; protoss player has the terran player on the run(he could track him 
&#62; down wherever he goes:).
&#62; At the least could you allow the zergs/protoss to at least easily 
&#62; destroy all the upgrades so that the terrans won't have them again if 
&#62; they come back.  Pls provide some feedback on how u feel about the 
&#62; idea.
&#62; 
&#62; By the way thanks for letting up a little on that heavy veil of 
&#62; secrecy blizzard:)  Maybe you could give us a rundown on the races 
&#62; and each  of their abilities sometimes?

You aren't getting the point of balancing races!  They can not all use
the same thing to get upgraded and they all have different strengths
and weaknesses in specific areas.  If they can all make use of these
upgrades that are left behind, then it becomes like Warcraft 2.  WC2
wasn't a bad game or anything (perish the thought!) but the orcs and
humans were more or less equal in every aspect, eg. 
1 grunt equals 1 footman.. You DON'T want this, it makes it less fun..
The Zerg or Protoss maybe won't be able to make use of the upgrades
but they will make up in other areas like unit strength, and the 
like..
Anyways.. Races need to be balanced, but not equal.. Some people 
have to find it harder to use Zerg or Protoss, and some people find
them easier..</pre>
