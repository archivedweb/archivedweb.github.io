&#62; &#62; I think the three races will balance out pretty well in one-on-one 
&#62; &#62; battles, but I wonder how things would work out in larger multiplayer 
&#62; &#62; games.  For example assuming that allies were using the same race I 
&#62; &#62; would rank them as such:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1.  Protoss (strongest)
&#62; &#62; 2.  Zerg
&#62; &#62; 3.  Terran
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; In other words a team using all Protoss would be very difficult to 
&#62; &#62; defeat in my opinion if they work well together to produce units.  An 
&#62; &#62; an all Zerg team would obviously be terrifying due to sheer numbers.  
&#62; &#62; An all Terran team?  I don't know if they'd be as intimidating.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Now I know all of this is speculation since the beta isn't out but it 
&#62; &#62; does bring up the point that the racial balance might be much more 
&#62; &#62; difficult to maintain as more human players join in the battle.  I'd 
&#62; &#62; appreciate comments on what a good team would be (i.e., which races 
&#62; &#62; make the best combo) and how you feel about the rankings above.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; 
&#62;     You make a good point but your confusing player skill with the 
&#62; unit power.  If a team of great Protoss players are in a game against 
&#62; other mediocer players of course they're going to win, because their 
&#62; good.  Its true that the number of Zerg on a team would be 
&#62; intimidating but thats the point of the Zerg, power in numbers.  I 
&#62; personally think a team of Terrans would be the most intimidating 
&#62; though, because you can't be sure exactly where they are at any one 
&#62; time.  With mobline buildings the Terrans could leave the second you 
&#62; discovered a base and you wouldn't know until they were gone.  Think 
&#62; about this, your in a six player game, two people of each race,your 
&#62; Protoss, all are good players.  The Zerg are pumping out a huge army, 
&#62; the Protoss are keeping an eye on the Zerg and hunting the Terrans 
&#62; down, but the two Terrans keep moving their bases around, and at any 
&#62; minute you could have a barracks landing just outside your defense 
&#62; range and starts pumping out goliaths.  Without a network of spies 
&#62; across the map, you don't know where the Terrans are at any given 
&#62; time, I don't know about you but that intimidates me.  Now the 
&#62; Protoss are intimidating because of their powerful units, which are 
&#62; fewer than any one elses, I can see why a team of Protoss would be 
&#62; thought more powerful but a group of just as many Terrans or Zerg 
&#62; with players on the same skill level will be just as powerful. 
&#62; Besides all this you left out the one team that would be the most 
&#62; terrifing, a mixture of all three.  Think about it, the power of the 
&#62; Protoss, the mobility of the Terrains and the numbers of the Zerg all 
&#62; mixed into one team, that  scares me more than any pure team.

A lot of Terran fans seems to think that the moving buildings will 
save the Terrans. Sure it'll be a cool thing, but as long as the 
bases keeps moving they probably can't make new units and all 
extensions will be lost.

I guess it will much more like warcraft. The price of a townhall will 
be so low, that is cheaper to build a new one than move the old?
