<pre>The ongoing system maintenance of a personal computer can be a very 
time consuming, costly,
and frustrating process. The overall productivity and cost of 
ownership of a personal computer is
heavily influenced by the time and money spent on system 
troubleshooting, managing files,
adding hardware and software, etc.

This report examines the system maintenance differences between an 
Apple Macintosh and a PC
running Windows 95. 

Maintaining a personal computer over time consists of the following 
actions:

1) Adding and removing applications
2) Reorganizing the desktop for convenience 
3) Hard disk space management
4) Adding and upgrading hardware components
5) Backing up files
6) Troubleshooting system conflicts and other problems
7) Recovery from system failures

Overall, the Macintosh is significantly easier to maintain than a 
Windows 95 system in all of
these areas. This is not only an issue of less frustration and 
requiring less knowledge to maintain
the system, but is also a matter of time saved. These issues are 
particularly important to the
home, education, and small business users, who usually have little or 
no access to experienced
support personnel.

There are two key reasons why Macintosh is easier to maintain than 
Windows 95. The first is
that Macintosh has a better architecture and less complexity with 
which the user must deal. The
second is that Windows 95 has many more interdependencies than does 
Macintosh. Let me
explain.

Complexity
With the Macintosh, the self-sufficient user needs to be aware of 
applications, their data files, the
system folder, Preferences, and inits. With Windows 95, I estimate 
the self-sufficient user has
about an order of magnitude more complexity to cope with. Below are 
lists of system files for
each system, of which the user needs to aware to perform system 
maintenance . (Programs in
square brackets may not be present on every system).

Macintosh System Files

       System 
       Control Panels 
       Extensions
       [System Update]
       [Individual program Preferences] 

Windows 95 System Files

       MSDOS.SYS
       SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT (Registry files)
       SYSTEM.INI
       WIN.INI
       COMMAND.COM
       [AUTOEXEC.BAT]
       [CONFIG.SYS]
       [AUTOEXEC.DOS]
       [CONFIG.DOS]
       [WINBOOT.INI]
       [Individual program .INI files]

Two key points are worth noting here. First is that in the case of 
Macintosh, it is much easier to
understand what function each system file performs and therefore, it 
is easier to identify the
source of problems. Secondly, working with Macintosh system files 
nearly always involves a
graphical user interface to make changes or else a corrupted file is 
merely replaced with the
original version. 

In the case of Windows 95, many kinds of problems give no clue as to 
which of the system files
is the cause of the problem. In addition, fixing problems typically 
involves editing text in these
files. Just replacing them with earlier versions may undo beneficial 
or needed changes made by
applications which have been installed successfully and subsequent to 
the original version.

Interdependencies
The point above leads us to note the many interdependencies which 
arise in the Windows 95
system architecture and which are much less prominent with Macintosh. 
When Windows 95
applications are installed, they routinely make changes to one or 
more of the system files. Thus,
for example, any of the system files may contain changes which were 
made by several different
applications. When problems arise, this means that the relevant 
system file must often be
diagnosed on a line by line basis. Even as Windows 95 evolves and 
developers tend to
concentrate their system changes in the Registry, the same problem 
remains. It is far from easy to
find and identify which Registry entries apply to any particular 
application or to determine their
significance. 

For example, this is PC Magazine's explanation of how to change the 
icon for My Computer:

       &#34;To change the icon that represents My Computer, open the 
Registry Editor and
       scroll to
       HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002-
B30309D}\DefaultIcon.
       After double-clicking on the Default value entry, type in a 
new data string that
       points to the icon file and icon you wish to use.&#34;

To change the hard disk icon on the Mac, you simply choose the menu 
command &#34;Get Info&#34; for
the hard disk, click on the icon, and paste in the new icon.

Let's examine the seven areas of system maintenance in detail:

1. Adding and removing applications
Although adding applications is probably about a draw between 
Macintosh and Windows 95,
removing them is not. 

On the Macintosh, nearly all applications are easily disposed of by 
just throwing them in the
trash. (The careful user will also dispose of any associated 
Preferences files, control panels and
extensions.) 

With Windows 95, just as with previous versions of Windows, 
applications may have left
entries throughout the system. They can leave entries in 
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS,
SYSTEM.DAT, USER.DAT, SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI and others, and there is 
always the
possibility that they may have created their own custom .INI file. In 
addition, many
miscellaneous files may be left in the Windows folder. Typically, 
after significant use, the
Windows folder can contain hundreds of entries with no reasonable way 
of knowing which are
still needed and which were created by applications no longer used. 
(Some may provide needed
information under Properties, but many will not). These entries can 
affect system performance,
and some can affect other applications as well. 

Although Windows 95 applications are supposed to include an UNINSTALL 
program, there is
no assurance that they will function perfectly. And on those 
occasions when the entire system
does not run after a new program is installed, there may be no 
platform available from which to
run UNINSTALL. Uninstalls cannot usually be run from Window 95 SAFE 
mode or DOS. 

2. Reorganizing the desktop for convenience
It is not long before new computer users realize that they use 
certain applications and files much
more often and so want easier access to them. On the Macintosh, this 
is easily done either by
rearranging the files and folders themselves or by creating aliases 
to point to those items most
frequently used. If aliases are used, the original items can be left 
in their original locations or can
be moved and renamed and the alias will continue to point to them. 
Reorganizing the desktop can
also consist of relocating items so that those used together are in 
the same folders and of
renaming folders and files to make their function more readily 
apparent.

Windows 95 users suffer from a number of disadvantages here. First, 
moving applications or
renaming their directories can cause the links to all documents 
created with that application to
break. Second, Windows 95 shortcuts (unlike Macintosh aliases) cannot 
reliably track moving or
renaming of the original files. Third, because applications are 
usually installed into the Start
menu with no desktop representation, it can be difficult or time-
consuming to even find where
the original application is.

3. Hard Disk Space Management
Many users eventually begin to run short of hard disk space. The 
usual answers are to throw out
unnecessary files or to buy a second hard drive. In either of these 
cases, the Windows 95 user is
at a significant disadvantage. Windows users have a harder time 
identifying unnecessary files
because Windows applications use many more files than Macintosh 
applications, with most
having cryptic file names and many which get placed into the Windows 
folder with hundreds of
other mysterious files. It is doubtful that Windows 95 will quickly 
change these long held
programming practices. 

In the case of making use of an additional hard drive, Windows 95 
users are at a tremendous
disadvantage. If they move applications to the new hard drive, the 
links between applications and
their resource files get broken and the user will have to reestablish 
these links manually--a
significant task in itself. This is due to the previously mentioned 
fact that moved Windows
applications lose their links with data files and shortcuts.

4. Adding and Upgrading Hardware
Macintosh users have always enjoyed a significant advantage in the 
ability to &#34;plug and play&#34;
new hardware add-ons. Apple built in SCSI to the Macintosh in 1986 
for the easy addition of up
to seven external hard drives, scanners, CD-ROM's etc. and the Mac's 
NuBus cards were
always self configuring. Up to now, PC users could do neither easily. 
Hours of configurations
with dip switches, IRQ and DMA settings, and driver installation made 
adding new hardware a
nightmare in the Windows world.

The new Plug and Play specification in Windows 95 promises to help 
this problem in the future,
but many existing computers and peripherals are incompatible or 
problematic with Windows 95.
Some skepticism is always appropriate for a new set of specifications 
before they are proven to
have actually worked in the marketplace. Very few Plug and Play 
peripherals are currently
available in the marketplace, and many new PCs still don't support 
the Plug and Play
specification. It will take years before this Plug and Play 
transition is over for the Windows
world. 

5. Backing Up Key Files
My experience has been that on the Macintosh, it is adequate to only 
back up data files. Thus, a
simple file copy operation based on last modification date suffices. 
With Windows 95 there is
much more reason to back up system and application files as well. 
This is for the following
reason: With Macintosh, the user can almost always reinstall the 
system or any given application
without having to change anything else. With Windows 95, it is much 
more likely that such
tactics will not work, and the user will be forced to choose between 
a complete restore of a
previously good set of system and application files, or to do the 
installation over completely with
system and all applications. The key reason for this is that because 
applications keep needed
information in system files, reinstalling the system may cause 
applications to fail and to need
reinstalling themselves. 

Windows 95 also changes more files and kinds of files in operation 
than does Macintosh. When
doing comparable operations on a Macintosh and a Windows 95 PC, I 
have noted that a backup
based on the archive bits on each machine shows the Windows machine 
changing many more
files than the Macintosh, including system files and files in the 
Windows folder. If one believes
that these changed files are significant, then they need to be backed 
up, and the file backup which
is sufficient on the Macintosh is not sufficient for the Windows 95 
user.

6. Troubleshooting System Conflicts and Other Problems
Here is where our prior concepts of complexity and interdependence 
are most relevant. On the
Macintosh, the vast majority of problems can be diagnosed and fixed 
by the following: resolving
init conflicts, throwing out or replacing Preferences files, 
reinstalling individual applications or
reinstalling the system files. Reinstalling one item rarely causes 
the failure of any other part of the
system. Throwing out Preferences files does not cause failure because 
applications merely
replace them with default Preferences. Of all these items, only inits 
show a significant problem
with interdependencies, and even here, there are excellent tools 
available from third parties to
isolate and disable conflicting inits.

The complexity of troubleshooting in Windows 95 is mind boggling. 
Some key documented
sources are the section of the Windows 95 Resource Kit beginning on 
page 1059. The same
material appears in hypertext format in the Windows 95 Resource Kit 
Help File under General
Troubleshooting under the Windows 95 Reference. There are several 
things worth noting about
this material. First, it is a collection of procedures and ideas, not 
a logically organized flow chart.
Second, it assumes a great deal of other knowledge. Third, it points 
to entire chapters as
references, belying the fact that the section itself is only 22 
pages. Fourth, it makes no reference
to procedures I have personally experienced working with Tech Support 
for Windows 95
applications, and it can therefore fairly be called incomplete.

Having already been competent in troubleshooting Windows 3.1 problems 
and having developed
the ability to identify and fix specific problems, I have to date 
been unable to consistently
troubleshoot and specifically fix Windows 95 problems. Editing system 
files often has
consequences far removed from what simple logic would lead one to 
believe. In addition, the
available documentation is often inadequate in the face of real 
problems. At times, my experience
has been that attempts to fix specific problems have only made things 
worse until I got to the
point where I had to either do a complete restore or a complete 
reinstall. I have heard the same
comment from other industry experts. Of course, PC gurus don't pride 
themselves on being the
first to declare that something has become so difficult that they can 
no longer do it. Only time will
tell if this is a lasting conclusion and how many others arrive at 
it. 

The complexity of Windows 95 troubleshooting goes hand in hand with 
the interdependencies
inherent in the architecture. Many of the key system files are likely 
or certain to contain entries
from multiple applications. In addition, it is often extremely 
difficult to identify in which system
file the problem resides. Combining these two facts shows why fixing 
Windows 95 problems by
replacing files is a difficult strategy. Another way of looking at 
this is that with Macintosh, one
typically replaces a system file with the original version. With 
Windows 95, one needs to replace
it with the last good version, if such can be determined.

While I can count on solving a Macintosh problem in minutes or hours, 
Windows 95 problems
have taken days. 

 

Adult Reasons Why Educators Should Continue to Embrace
Macintosh

by Michael J. Johnson, Ph.D.

 

Over the last three years my two co-authors and I have evaluated all 
the educational technology
projects funded by an educational foundation in the 14 Western 
states. After visiting scores of
schools and universities, corresponding with hundreds of teachers and 
administrators, and
producing two videos, we concluded that the battle over which 
platform, Macintosh vs.
DOS/Windows, was an adult issue. Students easily adapt and move from 
one platform to another
rather seamlessly. Students do get very upset when the platform they 
are given is incapable of
doing some of the things they learn that another machine can do or do 
with less effort. But for
the most part, kids adapt. So it is the adults who seem to have so 
much invested in the platform
war.

The platform controversy often goes to extremes in school districts 
as allegiances are strong and
bias is at times an insurmountable obstacle as it is in any holy war. 
People's emotional
attachments to the platform they learned on often make it nearly 
impossible to be objective. This
battle has left most educators, administrators, and board members at 
an extreme disadvantage in
that they do not have an educational technology background and have 
had to rely on their
technical computer support staff and others for information and 
recommendations.

The recommendations and information they have gotten has often been 
biased by the platform
bias of their techies. In the past educators, administrators, and 
boards may have been
uncomfortable with this situation, but left it up to the techies. 
That situation has changed! The
importance of the platform decision has become much more critical in 
the last two years,
however, as the world and school technology programs are changing at 
breakneck speed.

The pervasiveness of the Internet as a new viable vehicle for 
commerce and information is
driving this technological revolution in education. School districts 
will spend 5 billion dollars in
the next year on technology and higher education is spending even 
more. Everyone is thinking
about, and the vast majority of districts are, wiring their buildings 
and installing networks. As
the American Association of School Administrator reports, school 
world wide web site home
pages grew exponentially from 134 to 2,850 in just 18 months, 1995 
into 1996. The importance
and the amount of money being expended on school technology are 
making board members and
administrators very nervous about platform decisions.

The national bad press that Apple has received has also increased 
administrator and board
member anxiety over the platform issue. Macintosh is THE major 
multimedia platform in
education today, according to the latest report by Quality 
Educational Data. The bad press has
prompted some school administrators I know to ask themselves the 
question whether they should
purchase fewer Macintoshes. Board members and administrators are also 
at a disadvantage in
making that decision because they often lack, or are not given, 
factual information upon which to
base that decision.

 

An Objective Analysis

Anyone reading an article that might favor one side or the other in 
the platform holy war is
immediately cautious of which side of the battle line the author is 
writing from. I have done many
platforms from CPM to Macintosh to Unix to Windows. I have favored 
Macintosh in schools for
many practical reasons, but with all the furor over Apple's bad 
press, I purposefully set out to
objectively research the issue with an open mind, willing to consider 
moving away from
Macintosh, if the facts indicated that the world had changed and that 
would be an appropriate
decision. As Deputy Superintendent for Instruction and Technology of 
a large suburban school
district that has been purchased $8 million dollars worth of 
computers in the last four years -- I
have to remain as objective as possible in this fast changing world 
of technology. There is just
too much at stake to let previous bias cloud being able to see what 
is really happening. Following
is what I found in my personal research into the platform issue in 
the last six months.

 

Networking and Networking Support

Installing networks in schools is growing at an exponential rate. 
According to QED (1996)
school district networks have grown 600&#37; in the last five years. 
The ease and cost of supporting
a platform on local and wide area networks should be a significant 
factor in deciding which
platform to purchase. Our district has an extensive intranet and 
internet network. We have
installed thousands of Macs and PCs on our network in the last two 
years. We have found a
significant difference between Macs and Windows machines. This 
difference is easily seen in the
directions on how to install each platform. The Windows directions 
are 3 pages long, single
spaced, and only our district windows techies and a few building 
level techies can do the
Win-stall. The Mac directions are 1/2 page long, including a picture, 
and we have trained all our
librarians how to install Macs on the network.

Although Windows95 has gotten significantly better, even our most 
devoted DOS-heads still call
it plug and pray. We have analyzed the time that it takes our 
technical staff to install the Windows
platform, especially on multimedia windows machines. Installing a Mac 
on the network takes
10-15 minutes; Windows 3.1 45 minutes to an hour and Windows95 it 
takes 45 as well,
although a small percentage of Windows95 machines can be as short as 
20 minutes, as long as
Windows95 will find and identify the correct ethernet driver.

If there are any problems on a Windows install, building level 
techies, simply can't handle it.
Supporting the Mac platform on networks is exponentially less 
expensive and perhaps more
important, requires far less district level support.

This lack of technical support, especially at the building level, has 
been identified in Texas and
nationally as the number one problem in equational computing. Just 
buying technology has
proven to be a major challenge for most districts and getting enough 
technical support positions
seems completely off the horizon. The ease of installing and 
maintaining a platform becomes a
real concern when technical resources are at such a premium. 
Computers can sit in closets or on
desk tops as dark screened Cassandras foretelling the death of the 
school's educational
technology program.

 

Cost of Supporting the Platform

In the fall of 1995 Gardner Group, the national computer consultin 
firm that provides services to
corporate America and larger educational institutions, released an 
independent study that
concluded that Macintosh was at least 25&#37; cheaper to support than 
the Windows platform. This
data matches our District's general experience with platform support, 
especially with the advent
of networking as such an important computer function.

 

Ease of Use and How to Use it

Which is easier to use, Mac versus Windows, is another of those 
&#34;nary the sides shall meet&#34;
issues in schools. So perhaps the opinion of the CEO of the company 
that makes the most
popular computer processor for Windows machines might be viewed as 
being a little less biased.
Andrew Grove, CEO of Intel in his 1996 book, Only the Paranoid 
Survive , says on page 58,
Windows wasn't even as good as the Mac, let alone the NEXT interface, 
and it wasn't
seamlessly integrated with computers or applications. Our experience 
with the Mac platform
bears this out as the MacOS takes much less time to learn and to 
start using effectively.
Windows95 has made improvements but it still has a good distance to 
go to match the MacOS.
We expend much less staff development resources to start a Mac 
platform classroom and teacher.

 

Cost of Support: Replicating Business's Technology Model Won't
Work in Education 

Another factor that parents in particular express at school PTO 
meetings is, &#34;Shouldn't we have
the same computers in the classroom that are the majority in 
business?&#34; This is also especially
enticing for school administrators and board members who are much 
more in tune with business
and business management practices. But there are some key differences 
between business and
education, especially in regards to computing.

The first major difference is that studies show that business 
provides a support ratio of one
computer support person for every 35-60 users. In our district, the 
ratio is closer to one technical
support person for every 750 users. National studies and a recent 
study in Texas, list computer
support the most critical problem in educational computing at the 
district and particularly at the
building level. Given how difficult it is to get money just for 
computers, hiring an army of
techies to support them will not fly with tax-payers and parents. 
Business' computer support
model would be nice for education, but it just won't happen.

The last, and perhaps most surprising reason that business computing 
is not a model for
education is that K-12 students are power users. Most K-12 students 
use the computer as a true
mutlimedia tool and their technological expertise is very 
sophisticated, especially when compared
to most business users.

 

We Have Students Who Construct Their Own Internet Web Pages --
They Have No Front Teeth and They Still Believe In the Easter
Bunny!

The vast majority of business people do not use the full multimedia 
capabilities of their
computers. Elementary students in putting together a multimedia 
report will record sound, scan
pictures and draw graphics, input a digital camera image, incorporate 
word processing, program
an animation, and even input a video segment into their multimedia 
report. Few business users
begin to be that sophisticated. Student computers have to have more 
capability and power.
Putting a standard business desk-top in every classroom would 
seriously hamper most of our
student computer users.

 

What Computer Features Best Support and Enhance Learning:
Multimedia

When the first computers hit classrooms in the late 1970s, we took 
the new technology and used
it in our current way of doing things -- we created Computer Assisted 
Instruction (CAI),
Electronic workbooks. We have since learned that a workbook in paper 
form is only $10 dollars
while a computer costs, $2,000. Moreover, we have found that 
multimedia enhances student
learning in ways that are amazing that that we are just beginning to 
understand.

Regardless of the affects of multimedia learning that we are just 
starting to realize, the internet
has made it obvious that multimedia is the present and future of 
computing. The install base of
mutlimedia machines in schools is now 1.9 million or 41&#37; of the 
total. (QED, 1996) We have
learned that computers are tools for learning and discovery and that 
information and knowledge
and more than just the text and

pictures we have had in books. Information is digitized and can be 
text, pictures, graphics,
sound and video. Providing information in all these ways really 
enhances learning for all
students and especially for all those students we know are very 
bright but have just not reached
their potential in school. In addition, once kids use multimedia, 
they want to use it all in their
learning. This generation of young people in our schools is creating 
a &#34;time-bomb of computer
users&#34; as Andrew Groves discusses in Only The Paranoid Survive.

 

Which Multimedia Platform Delivers the Most Capacity at the Best
Price?

The very thing that has caused Macintosh its biggest challenge is the 
very thing that most benefits
schools, a truly integrated system. Apple kept its operating system 
and didn't allow others to use
in machines made by other manufacturers. DOS/Windows thus gained 
market share in the
business world because computers and parts became commodity items. 
You could mix and
match and build your own in the PC world. This permitted endless 
variation. All PCs came with
various slots that you could put different card devices in and have 
the computer that best met
your needs. Every Mac, on the other hand, comes equipped as a full 
multimedia machine with
sound input/output and graphics features. All the components in Macs 
were from the same
design/manufacturer and therefore they all have been designed to work 
together.

This endless variation on the DOS/Windows side, however, has lead to 
many serious problems
in different devices that were made by different manufacturers and 
installed in different slots in
the PC. I have seen this problem cause havoc in many places, and in 
schools in particular, where
advanced technical support is lacking. One project between several 
different school districts was
delayed for over nine months because the PCs they had would not 
function with both the
CD-ROM drive and the ethernet card installed.

Over the last year, even our district's most ardent Win-heads have 
been enthusiastic about
purchasing Macintoshes, as Macintosh delivered far more RAM, hard-
drive and full multimedia
features than any Windows manufacturer at a far cheaper price. Some 
of the Windows
manufacturers, such as Compaq are really starting to make headway in 
delivering comparable
capacity at more comparable prices, but the slot addressing and 
driver problems continue to be a
problem that is not going to go away in the near future. Our district 
analysis is that Apple is till

Best Company Sales and Support to Education

Apple has the most sophisticated sales and support force for 
education. Some PC resellers are
providing excellent service, but no PC manufacturer can provide the 
information, assistance, and
support that Apple has been so good at developing over the last 20 
years. In addition, the
majority of Apple's educational support and sales personnel are 
former teachers themselves and
have a good understanding of the needs of teachers and students and 
how technology enhances
learning. The other manufacturers tend to hire business graduates who 
do not have the important
experience and knowledge. Again, Compaq is making in-roads in this 
area by developing a
functioning educational marketing team complete with former educators 
and former Apple
employees... but it will be a while in developing.

 

Conclusion: Macintosh is Still the Best Platform for Education

Our students do get very upset when they know that they can do things 
on the Mac that the
Window machine can't or they can't get the Windows multimedia 
functions to work properly.
But Kids are extremely adaptable and can use any platform or 
combination of platforms
seamlessly. However, when I consider the strictly adult reasons for 
choosing a platform, money,
resources, capabilities for learning, and fewer problems-- Macintosh 
is still the best computer
platform for education.

 

Will Apple Survive is Also An Issue: Chrysler Came Back - So Can
Apple

But &#34;which is better&#34; is not the only issue in the platform 
debate. Many school districts and other
educational institutions have questioned their continued purchase of 
Macintosh based on the
possibility that Apple won't survive. The current media feeding 
frenzy and the Apple's dying
spin they are putting on all stories about Apple have made everyone 
wonder. I have wondered
myself, but every time I get very far down that path, I think of four 
truths: 1) Media frenzies are
examples of stampede behavior and they are most often inaccurate 
perceptions of reality-- I
shouldn't believe everything I read or see on TV; 2) That Jobs, 
Wozniak, and Kawasaki are back
involved in Apple and that will count for something; 3) Chrysler 
nearly went under and came
back to lead their industry -- so can Apple; 4) That real competition 
provides Education with the
best software and hardware... and we need that competition to provide 
us with choices and better
products.

Apple will probably still have more bad news in their struggle, but 
many of us sincerely believe
that they will make it in the market place and remain Education's 
most prolific platform. Compaq
is right on their heals though in focusing on education and will 
provide some great competition.
But that is the major point, education needs that competition real 
competition between hardware
and platforms.

 

Uncertainty in the Computer World in General: Who Knows Where
It is Going!?

Another factor that has heightened anxiety over the Mac/Windows 
platform debate, is the general
anxiety about the vast amount of uncertainty and risk there is in the 
computer world in general.
The world of computing is about to (or at least most people 
anticipate that it will) go through
several major metamorphoses. The fight over Win-tel's (MicroSoft 
Windows and Intel) support
for Windows NT on IBM and Motorola chips has technology directors 
wondering which way to
go. The addition of the Apple/Next aquisition, Rhapsody, multi-
platform operating system, and
what advances it will bring to the desktop.

The techno-world seems even more disconcerting by the battle between 
the use of thin
clients/client server desk-top networks versus the full blown 
multimedia machines with
&#34;bloatware,&#34; large programs requiring big operating and 
storage memory. The introduction of
radically new products especially designed for Education, such as, 
Apple's new E-Mate 300
portable for students adds to the mix of questions about what to buy. 
All this uncertainty has left
many educators very nervous about computing in general. It is all 
moving so fast and any
decision you make could become a mistake. However, the best advise 
for how to make decisions
in today's very uncertain world might be to go with adult reasons for 
making decisions: Which
platform that exists right now saves the most money, time, and 
effort, and simultaneously,
delivers the most features that educators and students need at the 
best price?

Dual-Platform Support Costs

               Following is the summary of the Gartner Group report 
titled 

        Technical Support Costs and Dual-Platform Desktops: 
                            Managed Diversity 

Gartner Group Consulting Services recently concluded an extensive 
survey of actual
dual-platform costs collected from real organizations in the US. 
Conventional wisdom indicates
that it costs more to support both Macintosh and Windows than to 
support Windows alone. In
their report titled &#34;Technical Support Costs and Dual-Platform 
Desktops: Managed Diversity,&#34;
(copyright © 1995 by Gartner Group) Gartner Group concludes there is 
no support
cost premium associated with having both Macintosh and Windows (that 
is,
heterogeneous computing) over being single platform (homogeneous 
computing).

Objectives of the Study 

Gartner Group Consulting Services examines IT technical support costs 
in medium to large
organizations. The key objective of this study was to quantify the 
effect on technical support
costs of heterogeneity in end user computing environments. The study 
sample size exceeded
312,000 desktop computers. The study aimed at providing answers to 
the following
questions: 

       &#34;Do dual-platform computing environments result in higher 
technical support costs?&#34; 

       And, if the answer to the first question is yes, &#34;What are 
the main cost drivers resulting
       in this technical support cost &#34;premium&#34; associated 
with heterogeneous computing
       environments?&#34; 

In this study, Gartner Group surveyed over 65 enterprise IT 
organizations in the US in mid
1995, evaluating existing technical support infrastructure and costs. 
The study covered over
312,000 desktop computers. As such, the study includes varying mixes 
of Macintosh (up
to and including Mac OS version 7.5.1) and Windows based desktops (up 
to and including
Microsoft version 3.11). The study was concluded while Windows 95 was 
still in beta test.
Gartner Group says that while Windows 95 has minimally lower support 
costs than does
Windows 3.x, there is nothing about Windows 95 that changes the 
fundamental
conclusions of their study. 

Background

Most organizations deploy desktop computers from several hardware 
vendors, supporting both
Macintosh and Windows. Gartner Group calls this &#34;heterogeneous 
computing&#34; because there is
so much diversity apparant at the desktop. 

At the same time, IT organizations are often under budget pressure 
and are called on to reduce the
costs of supporting the overall organization without regard to any 
benefits of dual-platforms to
end users. This has led some IT organizations to evaluate the single 
platform challenge: would an
all-Windows environment have lower IT technical support costs than a 
dual platform one? 

The common wisdom is that initial installations of a technology bear 
a larger portion of the
support costs and, as the technology proliferates, support costs can 
be spread over a larger
installed base, lowering the incremental support cost of later units. 
Old erroneous beliefs
were that introduction of a second technology will dilute this 
economy of scale and unavoidably
make a dual-platform environment more expensive to support. 
Furthermore, this effect will be
present even if one of the technologies has fundamentally lower 
support costs than the other. 

Following is a &#34;theoretical&#34; model of what such a dual-
platform penalty region would look like.
At one extreme is all Windows; at the other is all Macintosh. In the 
middle, the &#34;hump,&#34; if it
exists, would represent the extra costs of being dual platform. Note 
that Gartner Group did not
find any such region in the data. 



Effect of Windows 95 

Gartner Group's major conclusion is that, while conventional wisdom 
might suggest that
standardization on a single platform would lower technical support 
expenses, there is no cost
premium associated with supporting both Macintosh and Windows. And, 
while the
study was conducted prior to the public release of Windows 95, 
Gartner Group says that
deployment of Windows 95 doesn't change the fundamental conclusions 
of this study. 

Gartner Group's Methodology 

The principal methodology used was a survey conducted using one-to-
one audio
teleconferencing interviews. Sixty-seven companies, all located in 
North America, participated in
the survey; the sample size exceeded 312,000 desktop computers. The 
companies represented a
wide range of industry sectors, installed base sizes, and degrees of 
heterogeneity. The survey
was supplemented by a small number of audio teleconferences that were 
held with a subset of the
participant companies. 

The data were gathered in mid-1995 and were not supplemented by data 
collected during
previous studies. Although a certain amount of filtering had to be 
performed to eliminate
responses that were incomplete, no attempt was made to infer or 
reconstruct missing data.
Technical support costs were equated with full-time equivalent (FTE) 
technical support
personnel. Gartner Group has often found that personnel costs are the 
main determinant of
technical support costs, and furthermore, that it is usually 
quantifiable more accurately than other
cost elements. A number of different data analysis methods were used 
to analyze the data, to
accommodate the nonlinearity of some of the data. 

Effect of Diversity on Support Costs 

Gartner Group found that total technical support costs in 90&#37; of 
the enterprises surveyed fall
below 0.025 FTEs/end user desktop. The most remarkable feature of 
these data is that they do
not show any deviation from linearity: there is no &#34;dual-platform 
penalty&#34; region
wherein the technical support costs are driven upward. Gartner Group 
concludes from this that
dual platform desktop standards (Macintosh and Windows) do not lead to
detectable increases in technical support costs. 



Regression lines fit through the data tend downward to the right 
(100&#37; Macintosh). This
confirms the frequently reported fact that Macintoshes are less 
expensive to support
than Windows systems (25&#37; less in this study) and Gartner Group 
concludes that overall
support costs decline as the percentage of Macintosh systems in the 
environment
increases. 

Effect of Support Quality 

To investigate whether the differences between Windows and Macintosh 
costs were due to
differences in the quality of technical support, Gartner Group 
conducted a pairwise comparison
between Windows and Macintosh support costs in individual 
enterprises. Gartner Group found
that in most environments, and regardless of the degree of Macintosh 
penetration, the Macintosh
was less expensive to support than Windows. Again, there is no 
visible effect due to mixing
desktop platforms. 

A closer look at those few environments in which Macintosh technical 
support costs exceed those
for Windows reveals some of the critical cost drivers. The use of 
problem resolution tools, for
example, reduces Macintosh support costs, as does the integration of 
these tools with network
management tools. Also, the use of multiple versions of the Macintosh 
operating system also
increases support costs. 

Effect of Management Style 

There are some environments that apparently do not have the same 
level of management control
as others. Gartner Group believes that these different environments, 
which they characterize as
tightly managed and loosely managed, are responsible for the 
existence of two distinct
bands in the support cost data, separated by a factor of four, into 
which the data cluster. After
separating the data into these two groups, Gartner Group found that 
one average technical
support person can care for about 95 Macintoshes or 77 Windows 
systems in tightly managed
environments. These ratios drop to 23 and 18, respectively, in 
loosely managed situations. 

    Average number of end users supported by one technical support 
person: 

                   Tightly Managed             Loosely Managed
                   Environments *              Environments *
                   ___________________         
________________________
 Macintosh :
 platform  :       95 end users                23 end users
           :
 Windows   :
 platform  :       77 end users                18 end users


* Not all environments experience the same level of management 
control. Some are more
successful than others at controlling technical support costs. 
Gartner Group refers to these
as &#34;tightly managed&#34; environments.



Best Use of Existing Windows Computers 

Gartner Group also found that increased production-type use (e.g., 
terminal emulation) decreases
support costs. This effect is particularly marked in the case of the 
Windows systems, where,
increasing terminal emulation usage from 0&#37; to 100&#37; can 
reduce support costs by 50&#37;.
Gartner concludes that concentrating existing Windows systems in
production-type use will reduce technical support costs. 

Effect of Remote Backup 

In a similar vein, Gartner Group found that sites with higher levels 
of remote backup incur
higher technical support costs. But this increase could be due as 
much to the fact that the labor
associated with local backups may be drawn from the end user 
community itself and therefore
not recorded in the study as would centrally managed technical 
support. It is also possible, of
course, that if backups are not done remotely, with the help of 
formal technical support staff,
they don't get done at all. 

Effect of End-User Training 

One way to assess the validity of the unexpected results of this 
study is to see if the same data
can be used to confirm other, more familiar, observations. For 
example, and in agreement with
other studies, Gartner Group found that while organizations that 
provide less than three days of
end user training per year frequently experience larger support 
costs, those that provide more
than three days per year see no further reduction in costs. 

                                                                      
    

The survey data collected in this study do not allow assignment of 
cause and effect. As an
example, the data are clear that no installation with more than about 
5,000 units falls into the
loosely managed category. But is it the case that having more 
desktops reduces technical support
costs? It could just as readily be argued that unless tight 
management is practiced, organizations
are unable to grow to over 5,000 desktops. The data by themselves do 
not suggest either one
interpretation or the other. 

Standardize at the Network and Application Layers 

Most of Gartner Group's interviewees agreed that successful control 
of support costs was made
possible by managing diversity at two crucial architectural layers: 
networking (file
and print services) and applications. Although the benefits to be 
achieved by the flexible
use of multiple desktop systems have long been felt, it was always 
believed that the costs of
supporting such environments made their use impractical. Gartner 
Group's observations indicate
that a significant number of enterprises have learned where to 
concentrate their management
efforts: it appears that they have learned to &#34;manage their way 
out&#34; of the extra costs that have
long been thought to result from such arrangements. Whereas in the 
past, it was thought that to
control these extra costs one should manage at the hardware on OS 
layers (that is, go single
platform), in this study Gartner Group found the companies would have 
success managing at the
network and application layers. 

                                              

Windows Systems Inherently More Heterogeneous 

Finally, Gartner Group concluded that in the real world, there really 
is no such thing as being
&#34;single platform.&#34; Companies deploy multiple generations of 
Windows platforms from several
different hardware vendors. Thus, even in the &#34;pure&#34; Windows 
shop, there are multiple add-in
cards both from vendors and from users, </pre>
