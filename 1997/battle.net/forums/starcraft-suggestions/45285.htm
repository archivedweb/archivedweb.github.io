<pre>Well, I am realy exited that  Starcraft is coming out soon.  A shrine 
has developed in my room devoted to the game.  But every day, I end 
up with more questions and comments, and I had to write them down, 
and see what people thought.  so, here we go...

Questions:

1)what kind of visual effects will there be in Starcraft?  Will there 
be support for 3d cards? And if so what cards?

2)Will all races have some sort of magic? Or will the protos be the 
race with the magic powers?

3) will you be able to change the resolution in Starcraft?  

4) what will the AI be like in starcraft?  One of the biggest 
problems with Warcraft 2 was the AI (and the archers uselessness in 
combat) sucked.  It never built demo squads: atacked with the wrong 
creatures: and seemed to be able to keep up with you whatever the 
circumstances were: never seeming to run out of money.  And some how, 
the AI in war2 knew all the time what you were doing...but how? they 
never build flyers? so how do they know?  I hope the AI in starcraft 
will be much better.

5) will the terain be interactive in starcraft?  Will explosions 
bring dents in the ground?  can you set things on fire? will the 
ground get stained with blood after huge battles?

6) In a cgw a while ago, they talked about how you were trying to 
impliment weather effects into starcraft.  Are you?  And if so, how 
does it work, what does it effect, and what kinds are there?

7)Are there boats in starcraft? and if not, how do the units get 
acros  water?

8)will the terains or protos have any melee units a la war2? or will 
they all have weapons?  What about the Zerg?  Will they be all Melee 
and no weapons?  And what do the zerg shoot?

9) I heard that the tank for the terans can turn inot a stationary 
base and fire around it.  Is that true?  (I like the idea!) Will the 
protos and zerg have simular units and/or towers?




I only have one comment....

1) I heard somewhere on this forum that signing onto bnet will alow 
you to Pw your name, so that only the creator of the name can use it. 
Is this true?  If it isn't, it would be a worthwhile feature to 
include.  Part of the fun in online games is finding the same people 
over and over again, but if anybody can sign on as anybody else, you 
can never tell if they are the real person or not.  On kali, 3 poeple 
took my name in the space of three month, making people think they 
were me when they weren't.  If this feature isn't there, it would be 
an  excelent feature!


I hope you answer these, and thank you if you do
