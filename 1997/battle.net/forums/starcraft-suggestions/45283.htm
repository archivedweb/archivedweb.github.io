&#62;      I think that cruddy was funny the first time I saw his message.  
&#62; As a matter of fact I poted a comment saying for him to do it again.  
&#62; I think that he is still funny in some things he says... but that he 
&#62; is trying to hard, cuz some of his stuff just does'nt cut it.  As for 
&#62; hating cruddy... I don't... cuz he give me something funny to read 
&#62; while I wait for other forumers to post thier comments/suggestions.  
&#62; I don't know why everyone makes such a big deal about cruddy, but I 
&#62; really don't think there is any reason to &#34;RAG&#34; or 
&#62; &#34;DIS&#34; cruddy.  If you don't like what he's got to say... 
&#62; don't read it.
&#62; 
&#62;      Actually... I would really like to know what AdamM and Pat think 
&#62; about cruddy.  If your reading this guys... please let me know!
&#62; 
&#62;                          And that's my 2 cents,
&#62;                                            Izze

 Izze,
   As for your question, I'll have to talk that over with the 
development team. Look for it in the next uberlist.
