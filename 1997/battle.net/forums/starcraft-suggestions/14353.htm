&#62; HEY FOOL
&#62; 
&#62; Where did you learn english?
&#62; Or do you just not know how to type?
&#62; 
&#62; Stay off this page you illiterate sob
      Well, if we are going to bust people for misspelling and 
incorrect grammar, YOU better get off the page.  Maybe we should 
force people how to punctuate after every sentence, ie 'Stay off this 
page you illiterate sob'   Do you see punctuation?  I know that I do 
not see any in that sentence.  Also, for all the people who call him 
stupid and say they cannot understand his writing, maybe you are the 
ones who need to work on their English.  After all, it is not that 
hard to understand if you know how to read.  Well, I guess my point 
is that we do not need to flame people who are different than 
ourselves and may not be as profficient in the English language as 
many of you think you are.  Everyone should have their own voice, 
even people who cannot go a few hours without flaming someone.  
Everyone should be able to post on this forum, and if you do not like 
how they write, then keep away from their posts.   Every time this 
guy writes, there are people flaming him.  If you all cannot stand 
him, why do you still bother to read his posts?  Maybe he also is not 
truly as 'illiterate' or 'moronic' as you think.  Just remember, you 
snobs, not everyone in this world is the same as you and we should 
not take offense to what they have to say and how they say it.  Who 
knows?  Maybe this person is smarter than all of us and s/he just 
does not speak English as a first, second, or maybe even third 
language.  Maybe s/he is just not very good with English, but does 
that rule out this person being intelligent and having good ideas.  
Maybe you need to take a good hard look at yourself.  I am not trying 
to 'flame' anyone at all, I am just attempting to convince anyone who 
does flame for grammar and punctuation mistakes not to.  Go ahead and 
flame them if you must, but you just make yourself look the fool.

Vossman[DN]
P.S.- I do not care if you find mistakes in my grammar or punctuation 
because I typed this up in haste in a minute or so.
Oh yes, and we all know how educated the 'YOUR MOM' flames are, if 
you think only educated people belong here.</pre>
