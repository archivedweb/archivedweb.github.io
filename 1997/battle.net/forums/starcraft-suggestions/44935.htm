<pre>Accually it is a bad time to ask questions. After the work day is 
over, all the Blizzard staff go home. They don't have spe :)cial 
people come in to work the night shift just to answer questions. 
Blizzard doesn't usually go back and answer questions from the night 
before either. I don't know if this will answer any of your questions 
but: Blizzard told me that giving units their own special picture 
would not be in the game. Mainly because they want to keep the scum 
files small. So anything you could think of to add to a scum, make 
sure it would increase the file size dramitally. Bybye!

PS- if you want Blizzard to answer the rest of your questions, repost 
the message tomorrow afternoon. :)

&#62; I was thinking of some possible scm.'s I could make and then I had 
&#62; some questions.
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  How many AI's are there?
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  What are the different AI's?
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  Can you set the difficulty of the AI's?
&#62; 
&#62; 4.  When you create a heroe, can you just take a regular unit or 
&#62; heroe and tell the map editor you want a heroe that looks like this 
&#62; or is it more restricted to something like, adjust Lothar's stats and 
&#62; name?
&#62; 
&#62; 5.  Can you make two different heroes with different stats and names 
&#62; but with the same GFX?
&#62; 
&#62; 6.  If you have a multi campain and some of the players have to kill 
&#62; each other, how do you get to the next level?
&#62; 
&#62; 7.  In a multi campain, can you have a unit gain levels through out 
&#62; the game and adjust it's stats for certain levels without it losing 
&#62; it's levels?
&#62; 
&#62; 8.  Can you set units on a premade path?  This would be cool for a 
&#62; mission where you had to keep a heroe which you cannot control alive 
&#62; and he/she was just following your premade path through ambushes.
&#62; 
&#62; 9.  Is there a certain number of scenarios that have to be in a 
&#62; custom campain?  Is there a maximum?
&#62; 
&#62; 10. (Not a question)  I really think there should be walls.  I want 
&#62; to make a prison camp in the middle of the mountains without having 
&#62; to make another scenario with instalation tileset.
&#62; 
&#62; That's about it... for now... :)
