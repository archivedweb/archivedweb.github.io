    Thats it. It has took me a while but oh well. If i was
not suposed to post this kinda stuff up, im sorry. I give all
my credit to Computer Games. Some of these may not be right (the
avenger for ex.). And some are in the wrong catagories but i didnt
feel like tryin to figure the flying and the ground units out.
    Maybe this will clear up some things about the units names
and stuff. It's 1:30 in the freakin morning here so thanks for 
reading but im gonna sleep.
