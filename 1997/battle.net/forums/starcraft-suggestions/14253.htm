&#62; 
&#62;      OK!  This is in reply to a kind of old message, posted either 
&#62; last saturday or friday, by someone claming to be ME!  It was not ME! 
&#62;  Here is what happened:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;      I took a trip to Florida for about a week, with some friends of 
&#62; mine and other people.  My younger (and stupider :) ) brother stayed 
&#62; home, because, well, he IS stupid.  He logged onto my computer, and 
&#62; onto the internet using my login and password.  THEN, the smart-ass 
&#62; went to the Starcraft suggestions forum, and procceded to right that 
&#62; pathetic message!  When I came home, he showed me it and the replie 
&#62; from SOMMS.  He thought it was funny!  I was barely keeping myself 
&#62; from kicking his a$$, when I saw what he had replied with. &#34;Very 
&#62; well done, or something.&#34;  VERY WELL DONE!?!?!?!?  WHAT IS THIS, 
&#62; A STEAK?!?!  So i did kick his ass.  And I apologize to anyone that 
&#62; would ever believe, for one second, that I have any sympathy for 
&#62; poor, adolescent SOMMS.  Thanks.
&#62; 
&#62;                                          Ugly the Cute

  This is the most pathetic story I have ever heard in my life.  I 
can't believe you went to the trouble to make this crap up.  Don't 
you realize nobody gives a rat's @ss what you did or ever will do?</pre>
