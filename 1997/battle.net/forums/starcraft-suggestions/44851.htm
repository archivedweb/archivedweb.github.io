<pre>To whom it may concern,
   I am fairly new to the internet.  I have been online since July.  
I was told to go to Blizzards website because it ruled.  I enjoyed 
playing WarCraft 2.  Then I was told about the new game StarCraft and 
wanted to find out everything about it I could.  I clicked on the 
link to battle.net and went to the StarCraft forum.  Then my friend, 
Wolftrigger as you know him, desided to start a StarCraft guild.  I 
thought it would be a great idea to join so i could have more friends 
but have them not in Florida.  I also thought it would be a great way 
to gain information on StarCraft.  I started posting all over 
battle.net to get other people to join the StarRaiders so they could 
help me learn about this game.  Then out of nowhere, I started 
getting acused of lying about the release date and spamming.  The 
ironic thing was, people started spamming the StarRaiders and calling 
us liars.  I can only assum that this was out of pure ignorance.  One 
of the friends I made from joining the guild told me about the 
release date as it had been told to him by two different stores.  
www.UnitedCDROMs.com and Babbages.  They both told him that they 
would have StarCraft on their shelves on November 26, 1997.  This was 
the date that we promised to tell those who joined.  Many doubted us 
but we didn't care.  We still don't care.  Then I, and I alone, got 
into a little disagreement with JOBE and some words were exchanged.  
None of this was intentional but the message was.  We wanted to gain 
more members and become stronger instead of being weak.  We have 
gained many allies, and a couple enemies.  I don't even know the 
point of war.  I saw on my female friends shirt a very good quote.  
It read, &#34;If violence is the answer, what was the question?&#34;  
think about that before reading on.

I don't like telling people off because I can be a very sweet and 
caring guy.  But I don't like to be bad mouthed by someone who only 
knows  by what I have typed.  If you are to ignorant and stupid to 
accept this as the truth that it is, then I don't care.  You have a 
right to you own opinion.  But when people don't know the difference 
between right and wrong, true and false, then where will this world 
be in about 30 years?  That is if it is...

hey. (SR)
join what ever guild you want. 
i am too exhausted to type the StarRaiders URL.
but you probobly already know it.</pre>
