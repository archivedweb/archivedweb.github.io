&#62; Did you read anything I said, (no I didn't :)they dropped the old

All right, looking at it again I can see that that's what you meant.  
In all likelihood, I was wrong and you were right (yech, bad taste in 
my mouth, err... fingers.  Whatever)  

However, now I'll make an attempt to prove I'm still right because I 
can't handle losing. :)

  Technically, Starcraft has been in development for over two years.  
Some of the ideas incorporated into the current SC WERE in the 
original E3 War2 TC version (Blizzard had pretty much decided on 
races, some units, the overall theme).  So the game as we know it 
today did originally begin more than 2 years ago, though the engine 
has undergone radical changes along the way.

&#34;I will never be wrong... ok, never again... well, I was just 
wrong right there in the last sentence... No no, I was right.&#34; =-p</pre>
