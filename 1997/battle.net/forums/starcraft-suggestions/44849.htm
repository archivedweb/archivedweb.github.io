<pre>&#62; Am I the only human critter left?
&#62; Cruddy Buddy
&#62; 
I too am a human critter, and i slice bloodlusted ogres i twain with 
my mighty sword. (with the help of my mages slowing and blizzarding 
the ogres of course)

On the subject of computers fighting it out to balance the play:
it would not work.

The AI's have to be programmed in differently depending on the race 
(zerg would not work well if you played them like protoss)
therefore the races may be balanced but the AI's might not be.  I 
personally think the AI for zerg would be vastly superior to an AI 
programmed for the terrans (think about it, it is easy to make the 
computer create large forces and manage reasources, yet very 
difficult to have it know when to move it's base, who to pick off 
with ghosts, etc.)  Therefore since the AI's are not going to be 
equal, a fight between two computers will not be equal even if the 
races are balanced for a human(as in player, not race) game.  

I hope you can follow my logic.

&#62; &#62; I was reading one of recent posts dealing with balanced sides. One of 
&#62; &#62; the replies pointed out that, it is a common mistake that most 
&#62; &#62; players see someone winning because of the race they choose and not 
&#62; &#62; because of their skill level. This has happen a lot in Warcraft 2, 
&#62; &#62; were bloodlusted ogres are viewed as the winning team.  However it 
&#62; &#62; got me thinking, are you guys at Blizzard gonna have it to were two 
&#62; &#62; or more AIs can fight amongst each other? Cause if you do... this 
&#62; &#62; would be a great way to also test balancing issues. You can set up 
&#62; &#62; two computers to fight each other with different species, and you 
&#62; &#62; just sit back and watch the game. Find out which AI will win... and 
&#62; &#62; figure out why it won and if it's necessary to do some more tweaking, 
&#62; &#62; etc... Just a suggestion :-)
