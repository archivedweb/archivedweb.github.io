<pre>I bought my PC to get away from the crashing my Mac used to do,
by that I mean constantly. It crashed all the time. Every program on
it would cause a systems failure. It crashed on average every 15 
minutes. That computer gave me a ton of problems daily. It lost the
hard drive 3 times (Yeah, you're probably thinking that I lost the
hard drive but No! I knew EXACTLY where it was!). It leaked fluid.
It yelled at me. It was not very nice to live with. In comparison my
PC only crashes when I'm in the heat of battle in Quake. I don't own
Quake so I think that's a pretty good track record.

&#62; I dunno, but maybe you haven't experianced the constant cpu load that 
&#62; typically comes with Windows or the garunteed &#34;Crash-A-Day!&#34; 
&#62; feature included with all Windows 95 computers.  I'm not saying Macs 
&#62; are good, I'm just saying Windows machines, well they just.. SUCK.  
&#62; I've worked with IBM compatibles since I started using computers 
&#62; (well I used Commodore 64's during summer school once..) and only now 
&#62; am I beginning to work with Macs, and I haven't experianced a single 
&#62; crash yet.  Both Windows and the MacOS have their problems, and 
&#62; neither one is the best OS, or crappy.  For me, the best OS is DOS, 
&#62; simple, easy to use (for me, if not the rest of you...), low memory 
&#62; resident, and basic hard drive access.  The hard drive access is what 
&#62; bothers me about both MacOS and Windows.  To really find something 
&#62; out in Win95, I have to use the DOS emulator, and in MacOS, you can't 
&#62; do that at all.  And hey - I don't use a Mac!
&#62; 
&#62; So basically - stop with this &#34;Macs suck!&#34; or &#34;Winblows 
&#62; sucks!&#34;, it's just an opinion, based on the &#34;I don't use it, 
&#62; so it must suck!  Cause if it didn't suck, I would use it!&#34; way 
&#62; of looking at life.
