&#62; I have been thinking about when Starcraft will REALLY come out.  
&#62; Basically, there are 3 groups of people who have and idea...
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  There are the loyal to Blizzard type.  They believe anything that 
&#62; Blizzard gives them.  Blizzard could say that it hits the stores 
&#62; tomorrow and they would believe it!  Of course Blizzard says that 
&#62; Starcraft will be done by American Thanks-giving.  (Which I don't 
&#62; really see possible since the Beta is to last 2 weeks and then they 
&#62; have to implement the changes that are needed after the Beta.)
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  Then there is the type that would like to believe Blizzard (and 
&#62; used to) but they can't because of all the things they have heard and 
&#62; the excuses that they have heard.  Also, they don't fully believe 
&#62; Blizzard because they realize that there is no way that the Starcraft 
&#62; Beta will be done and game completed by Thanks-giving.  (That is if 
&#62; there really is going to be a public Beta Test.  If you are in this 
&#62; group you don't really believe everything that Blizzard says.)
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  This group thinks that Starcraft will be a crappy game, Blizzard 
&#62; is a crappy company, and that Dark Reign and TA will far surpass any 
&#62; RTS game that will ever be made.  They only come to the forum to 
&#62; provoke arguments by degrading Starcraft and Blizzard, and making 
&#62; rumors like &#34;Starcraft won't be out  until Thanks-giving 
&#62; 1998!&#34;  
&#62; 
&#62; ?4?.  Yes, that's correct, there is a 4th group.  The group that 
&#62; doesn't care when Starcraft comes out (or I should say they DO but) 
&#62; they know that Starcraft will come out when it's good and ready to 
&#62; come out!  After all, isn't that what Blizzard has said from the 
&#62; beginning?  Starcraft will be out, (and probably will be soon) but 
&#62; this group will hold on until it is ready.  Because good things are 
&#62; worth waiting for!  And they will wait, until this fantastic game 
&#62; will come out!  
&#62; 
&#62; After all that has been said, I bring-forth my question to you!  
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  What group do you belong to?
&#62; 2.  When do you think Starraft will be in the stores?
&#62; 
&#62; PS.  I would like some answers, so either E-Mail them to me or post 
&#62; them up on the forum.  And I know Im going to get flamed, but I 
&#62; dont mind criticism, so bring it on!
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62;              Zombie[MRC]


Well I'd probably in the 4 group because STARTCRAFT is nothing more
than A GAME LET IT BE. I mean people in this forum remind me of KIDS
awaiting the fat red man to come down the cheminy.</pre>
