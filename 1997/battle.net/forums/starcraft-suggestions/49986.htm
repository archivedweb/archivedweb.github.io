&#62; &#62;      I have been keeping track of the progress and updates of 
&#62; &#62; Stracraft on Blizzard's website and the Battle.net site.  I have 
&#62; &#62; purchased and played Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo.  I enjoy them 
&#62; &#62; all and I am excited to here about the Diablo expansion pack.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      My question about Starcraft is the following.  From what I have 
&#62; &#62; been reading in reviews it seems as if the Protoss and the Zerg are 
&#62; &#62; going to be the dominant forces in Starcraft.  The one thing I have 
&#62; &#62; enjoyed is the balance that each race has and does not.  In Warcraft 
&#62; &#62; II this was obvious.  It seems as if the Terrans are just cannon 
&#62; &#62; fodder for the Protoss and Zerg.  I think every race should have it's 
&#62; &#62; strengths and weaknessess but they should not be obvious and easy to 
&#62; &#62; identify.  This has always been the mix for a great game.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      My concern is that one race will be vastly superior over the 
&#62; &#62; others and the game won't be that challenging or fun to play.  I look 
&#62; &#62; forward to purchasing and playing game.  I have a LAN at home with 6 
&#62; &#62; PCs.  My concern and Blizzard's to I would hope is to find a balance 
&#62; &#62; between all the races, each with it's unique strength, weaknessess, 
&#62; &#62; and benefits.  So if your multi-player gaming on your home LAN, via 
&#62; &#62; modem, or the battlenet you can pick any race and still have a 
&#62; &#62; fighting chance.  Where the main factors that determine if you win or 
&#62; &#62; lose is how you setup your base, manage and deploy your units, and 
&#62; &#62; your overall stragedy.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      I by no way mean to criticize the programmers efforts.  I know 
&#62; &#62; the hours they put in are long and hard.  High-tech industries are 
&#62; &#62; like that.  I am currently working on a project to implement cable 
&#62; &#62; modem technologies in the Seattle, WA area.  I just hope that 
&#62; &#62; Starcraft is everything if claims to be and hopefully alot more.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62;   
&#62; &#62;                                              Sincerely,
&#62;

&#62; 
&#62; We are going to strive to make sure that every race will be able to 
&#62; stand on its own two legs (or multiple appendages, for the Zerg) in 
&#62; multiplayer games against each other. This doesn't mean that the 
&#62; races will all play the same, however. They all will have their 
&#62; strengths and weaknesses for players to find (and exploit).

     Thanks for responding quickly to my questions.  It's nice to 
know that
StarCraft will have the crucial balance that makes a game great.  I 
sure 
that the Blizzard team is hard at work.  All we can do know is wait 
for
the BETA.  Have a nice day.
