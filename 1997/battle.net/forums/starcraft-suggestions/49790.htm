<pre>Good day fellow forumers and critters alike,

So today is the day.  Don't get too excited, today is not the day the 
Beta sign-up will be announced - at least, not to my knowledge.  
Today is not even the day new screenshots will be released or new 
units will be produced.  Today is the day &#34;Cruddymag&#34; issue 2 
will be posted.  OK, OK.  Quit booing.  If you think it's going to be 
great, I think you'll be gravely disappointed (Don't tell Cruddy I 
said that).  However, if you think it will be the worst thing you 
have ever read - you just may be right - then there is a weenie of a 
chance that you might actually like it... a little, maybe.

Last night a person e-mailed Cruddy Buddy a copy of THEIR VERSION of 
the &#34;Cruddymag&#34; issue 2.  It was rather, interesting, Cruddy 
let me read it; but it didn't flow with the theme of Cruddy Buddy.  
This person said that they were about to post it when they found out 
they had been banned from the Starcraft Forum.  We're kind of glad 
they didn't, since Cruddy worked hard to prepare one yesterday.

Like promised yesterday, Issue 2 of the &#34;Cruddymag&#34; will be 
posted this morning around 11:00am.  We critters here at &#34;Cruddy 
Buddy's Comedy Barn&#34; are also discussing an e-mail list for the 
&#34;Cruddmag&#34;.  Perhaps not now, but if enough support is shown, 
we may offer it in the near future.  It that were to happen, a 
&#34;Cruddy Buddy's Comedy Barn&#34; website would not be far behind. 
 That puts a pretty heavy load on Cruddy Buddy.  So, he's asked me to 
mention that he may need some assistance in the future with funny 
material, ideas, and web maintenance.  Please e-mail Cruddy Buddy if 
you are interested in helping.  Don't forget to mention what talents 
you have to offer!

Critter Carl,
Cruddy Buddy's Agent
&#34;Cruddy said it so it must be true!&#34;</pre>
