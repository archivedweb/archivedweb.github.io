&#62;       1.  Unit/Building/Technology restrictor: This is an absolute 
&#62; MUST.  This would allow the mapmaker to label units as 
&#62; &#34;untrainable,&#34; buildings as &#34;unbuildable,&#34; and 
&#62; upgrades as, um, &#34;unupgradeable&#34; :)  The mapmaker should be 
&#62; able to specify which sides are affected by this; player one might be 
&#62; able to build all units, and player 2 might only be able to build 
&#62; SCVs.
&#62;       2,  Hierarchy Editor, for lack of a better name:  This would 
&#62; allow the mapmaker to change the order in which buildings and units 
&#62; can be built.  For ex. in War2, you had to have a barracks and a 
&#62; lumber mill to build an archer, a barracks and a blacksmith to build 
&#62; a ballista, and you had to have  a barracks to upgrade to a keep. The 
&#62; mapmaker should be able to define and alter these terms, and change 
&#62; the way the game &#34;progresses.&#34;  If you had to have every 
&#62; structure in the game before __________ (really strong unit) could be 
&#62; built, players might think twice about building swarms of ____________
&#62;       3.  Unit Statistics Editor: Start with the awesome War2 editor 
&#62; Daniel Limberg made, and build up.  Besides being able to edit all 
&#62; base stats, the mapmaker should be able to edit both current and max 
&#62; health (you could create wounded units) and both current and max ammo 
&#62; (dueling at dawn :P).  You should be able to edit the weapon for each 
&#62; unit, the projectile for each unit, the sound for each unit, the 
&#62; portrait for each unit, and the graphix for each unit.  If you won't 
&#62; allow us to create our OWN graphics, then atleast let us mix and 
&#62; match the game graphics.
&#62;       4.  Landscape Stat editor: If Starcraft is set up so that there 
&#62; are variable terrains (units walk slow on sand, fast on a road, slow 
&#62; uphill, fast downhill, mechanized units go faster in sand than foot 
&#62; units, etc.) than you should be able to alter the effects of each 
&#62; terrain.  Make it so zerg can walk 2 times as fast on creep than on 
&#62; other terrain, for example (I think this might already be in the 
&#62; game)  also, it would be nice if you could edit the effects the 
&#62; landscapes had on the troops (creep healed the zerg slowly, the 
&#62; protoss homeworld makes the protoss recharge their &#34;magic&#34; 
&#62; bar 2 times faster, the terran world is rich in harvestable metals, 
&#62; etc.)  Maybe you could make it so that there were certain areas that 
&#62; would hurt a unit (make a poisonous forest or swamp).
&#62;      5.  Here's a question: can you make custom installation 
&#62; missions? I hope so.
&#62;      6.  If the terran tank can still morph into a permenate, 
&#62; immobile tower, be able to start a map with some already morphed 
&#62; tanks rooted in the earth.  Same goes for any other morphing unit.  
&#62;      7. Be able to right click on any UNIT (not building) and pull up 
&#62; this menu:
&#62;          A.) Upgrades-lets you add and takeaway upgrades to the unit. 
&#62;          B.) equipment slot-lets you specify what powerup is in the 
&#62; unit's equipment slot.
&#62;          C.) preorders- this is something i really like :) this 
&#62; feature would let you give any units that start out on the map one 
&#62; order for them to act out as soon as the game starts.  You could have 
&#62; it so that there is a gigantic enemy base, with units preset to 
&#62; patrol the parimeters as soon as the game starts.  Or, have it so 
&#62; that one of your forces &#34;accidentally&#34; wanders upon a 
&#62; detachment of enemy zergs.  Action right from the start equals 
&#62; satisfaction till the very end :P
&#62;          D.) Posture- lets you specify which direction the unit is 
&#62; looking, and, if there are zerg, if the unit is burrowed in the 
&#62; ground or not.
&#62;          E.) If the unit can attack, be able to choose how much ammo 
it has
&#62;       8. Be able to right click on any BUILDING (not unit) and pull 
&#62; up this menu:
&#62;          A.) If the building can train troops, be able to select a 
&#62; troop that will be immediately built, when the game starts (be able 
&#62; to choose whether the building of this troop takes any resources or 
&#62; not). if there is queuing, be able to choose how many of this troop 
&#62; are being built.
&#62;          B.)  Be able to choose if this building can be infested.
&#62;          C.)  If the building can attack, be able to choose how much 
&#62; ammo it has.
&#62;          D.) Be able to give the building a command (this would most 
&#62; likely just be for the terrans, and the command would be to move 
&#62; somewhere.)
&#62;      Thats pretty much it for now.  If some of these suggestions have 
&#62; been said before, then the person gets full credit :) I'll post more 
&#62; later.

I don't think that limited ammo will be in the game.  I would rather 
not have that to worry about.   Having to move back and forth to the 
base to reload would be incredibly tedius.  It *might* work if you 
could have a mobile depot that you could have travel with your units, 
but that would also be tiring.  As for ammo for buildings; that would 
entail having guys run around your base restocking every building.  
Building defenses will probably be energy weapons anyway and each 
building probably has access to enough energy to have effectivly 
unlimited ammo.
