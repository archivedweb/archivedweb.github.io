<pre>Ok, Battle.Net suggestions...

* SPECTATOR MODE!!!  This is my favorite idea!  Allow a large number 
of people to join a game as spectators!  Since they are not playing, 
they don't need as much information.  I'm sure you could work out an 
algorithm for this, without affecting the player's gameplay.  Maybe 
have a &#34;No Spectators&#34; checkbox if they don't want peopl to 
watch.  And the Spectators CAN NOT talk to the players, or they would 
affect the gameplay.  They are READ ONLY.  The best players like to 
observe sometimes.

* I liked the idea of having a &#34;Buddy&#34; list and a &#34;Don't 
play with&#34; list, or just a bunch of custom player lists.  And a 
&#34;auto-search&#34; feature that allows you to search for any/all 
of the people in each list who are online.  That would at least save 
me paper.

* Make every players stats viewable.  And, don't give any advantages 
for a player who has played longer.  I don't want a player to be able 
to keep money, units or anything that can be easily added with a 
hack.  I want to know that every time I play, the playing field is 
even.  Just keep their total kills, total games played, wins, losses 
etc.  I have a feeling that this suggestion was already violated.

* Give us the option of adding a photo or a logo to our stats.  This 
data can be stored on our machines and anyone who wants to look at it 
can.  I'm sure it would make it more interesting to see the 
warped/morphed/filtered/tinted/mirrored face of the person you were 
battling.  Then we could put pictures of our favorite Playboy models 
in the picture field to intimidate our opponents!

* Allow games to be entered at any time.  Keep it like Diablo, if 
they want a private game, then make a password.  The later you enter, 
the harder it is to get started of course.

* Memory hacking penalties.  I know that once they game is put on the 
net, people will develope ways to alter the memory during the game, 
and change aspects of the game.  This can eventually be detected, and 
I believe that a note should be put in a players stats if they have 
been detected doing this.  They shouldn't be kicked out or anything, 
because they have a right to play the game they purchased.  But I 
would like to know who has been cheating.  All it takes is a little 
increase in production to unbalance the game.

That's all I can think of right now.

Part II

For of War?
     I was just wondering if Blizzard was going to keep the Fog of 
War from Warcraft 2 in Starcraft?  I like the Fog of War.  That was 
one thing I hated about Red Alert (Still a good game), was that all 
it took was one spy-plane over my base, and I could never keep a 
secret again.  And the Allies had the GPS sat which allowed them to 
see the entire map all the time until you destroyed their tech 
center.  I also wanted to make sure that the AI players were also 
blinded by the Fog of War.  I have a feeling that the Warcraft II AI 
always knew where your base was, even if it couldn't see it.  I want 
to be able to hide units in unpatrolled areas of the map waiting for 
an attack.</pre>
