&#62; NOTE:   THIS IS JUST A JOKE!   DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!
&#62; 
&#62; Reasons AdamM left Blizzard (Joke)
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Management thought he wasn't taknig his job seriously enough, and 
&#62; Blizzard's special ops division (The Men in Blue) brainwashed him, 
&#62; and his new, more effecient identity is actually ScottM.  
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  The Diablo 2 team got a little too into the game and sacrificed 
&#62; him.
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  &#34;AdamM left Blizzard and is now working at another 
&#62; company&#34; is really just a nice way of saying he was caught trying 
&#62; to upload a SC beta to some ftp site, and got his ass canned.
&#62; 
&#62; 4.  Was asked to playtest a new build of SC, where you get to name 
&#62; your units.  He got so attached to a unit he named &#34;AdamM, the 
&#62; lean, mean zerg destroying machine&#34;, that when it died, the real 
&#62; AdamM died too, and Blizzard is trying to avoid a scandel.
&#62; 
&#62; 5.  PatN knew AdamM was popular than he was, and killed him.  (Just 
&#62; kidding there Pat, you know we luv ya.)
&#62; 
&#62; 6.  Because Blizzard has a new contest, (in which Blizzard employees 
&#62; are non eligible to win), in which you get to take an ACTUAL zerg out 
&#62; for a night on the town.
&#62; 
&#62; 7.  Doesn't want to spoil the surprise of what all the advanced units 
&#62; will be.
&#62; 
&#62; 8.  Disagreed with Blizzard's inhuman treatment of zerg.
&#62; 
&#62; 9.  Started dabbling in the black arts, and is now called Adam the 
&#62; Black and Blue.
&#62; 
&#62; 10.  Just partied really hard one night, and will be having a 
&#62; hangover for the next month and half.   
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, some of the ones towards the end kinda sucked, I agree.  If you 
&#62; have anything better, then post it in a reply.
&#62; 
&#62; Please tell me if you liked this or not

Really funny.

I had a theroy that he stuffed all the betas he could in his car and 
left to try to sell them to insane Blizzard adicts for Extreme 
amounts of $$$$.</pre>
