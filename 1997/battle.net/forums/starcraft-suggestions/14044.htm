&#62; Terran mechs, they are the strongest Terran forces, or we assume so, 
&#62; and what are their weapons?  Missles, and Machine guns, we've seen 
&#62; from screen shots that they have no actual melee weapon.  So 
&#62; basically if they can't keep a distance then they're at a loss.

Wrong,  the goliaths have flame throwers for melee combat and the 
Protoss will be the best long range attackers, or so I presume.

&#62; Second, say there is a research laboratory, it can move all right, 
&#62; and it can have wings to research biological stuff like that.  
&#62; Problem: the wings will get left behind should the lab find the need 
&#62; to move.  So don't go thinking that the whole Terran base could 
&#62; suddenly sneak up behind you or anything.  Yes I read these in a 
&#62; reputable computer magazine in case you're going to ask.

Exactly correct.
 
&#62; The Zerg will have absolutely NO long range weapons, and I'm sure 
&#62; you've seen pictures of the hydralisk and Ultralisk.  They have big 2 
&#62; foot long blades for arms, and it is been noted in the mags and 
&#62; previews so far that the Zerg will have the highest melee attack of 
&#62; every race, in addition to the fact that they will be the most 
&#62; numerous.

Right again. 

&#62; Now go back to Warcraft, take 9 upgraded rangers, and 9 upgraded 
&#62; ogres, and tell me which group would survive?  The ogres hands down.  
&#62; Of course the rangers would be a bit more powerful, and the ogres 
&#62; would be slightly less powerful, but just bear with me on this.

Rangers more powerful than ogres?  And you cant compare like that in 
War2 given the Rangers were not meant to be used like that, only in 
support of Knights or Footmen whereas in Starcraft the units will 
have different abilties and different attacking strengths but the 
numbers will balance it out.

&#62; You stated that the Terrans will be able to cloak themselves?  Well 
&#62; that's not how I heard it to tell the truth.  Take a look at those 
&#62; Protoss.  What race of aliens from what movie do they remind you of?
&#62; Yes, and remember the cool cloaking ability they had?  It wasn't 
&#62; total invisibility as there would be a very slight ripply affect 
&#62; around them but the idea is the same.  You can't tell where, or how 
&#62; many there are.

Maybe I missed it, but I didnt see him state that in this post...
  
&#62; Throckmorton is right when he says the Pylons and uplink(?) will 
&#62; probably have upwards of 1000hp or thereabout, kinda like the dark 
&#62; portal in War2.

Not that much, but probably still awfully high.  Phylons might, on 
the other hand, be extremelly cheap and easy to produce and very  
numerous in Protoss bases...

&#62; As for creep, I am confused by what people are posting about it on 
&#62; this forum.  What the creep is from what I understand is, there is a 
&#62; main hive and the creep gradually seeps outward in a circle from the 
&#62; hive, and as enough ground is covered, you can build more buildings 
&#62; on it.  In my opinion a very imaginative way to keep the Zerg from 
&#62; building up so fast.  After all, why would they need resources?

Youve got it, but the creep may not spread by itself, the new 
buildings would each have a radius of creep around it to extend the 
creep or the creep may only be able to go so far from any buildings.
 
&#62; The Protoss will almost undoubtedly have some sort of BLOODLUST, in 
&#62; fact that was confirmed, simply having a large group cast lust on a 
&#62; single unit and having it a nearly invincible killer for a time.  
&#62; They may also have some sort of shield ala Independance Day that is 
&#62; castable on their units and possibly buildings (hint important 
&#62; buildings).

There is already a shield for the Protoss units.
 
&#62; But when it comes down to it, you can't really know because it all 
&#62; comes down to the stats of the individual units.  If the mechs are 
&#62; about as powerful as the present day peons, and the dragoons more 
&#62; like juggernauts, well Terrans will get wasted so bad, it's awful to 
&#62; think about.

The GOLIATHS, since they are the most powerful weapon of the Terran 
whcih you say earlier and contradict here, will undoubtedly be more 
powerful than a peon in the game.  The race that would have units 
about as powerful as a peon, if that weak, are the Zerg, and even 
that would only be their weaker unit types.
