&#62; I am on neither of those sides. If that is your theory then why don't 
&#62; we all just wait till Dec 98 and the game will be even better than it 
&#62; would be if it was release Dec 97? How about waiting for Dec 2007? 
&#62; that way it is the most kick ass a game can be for a piece of work 
&#62; which took 15 years. Come on, I would like a good game yes, and I'd 
&#62; rather wait longer for a better game but what I'd really prefer is a 
&#62; game which is good AND doesn't delay long. It doesn't look like 
&#62; Starcraft will be released this year. Has beta testing been launched 
&#62; yet?


J,
  If you take too long the technology you used is out of date.  We're 
interested in making great games, in fact, we're interested in making 
the best games we possibly can.  Part of that though is knowing when 
to say &#34;enough&#34; and to get the game out.  Sure, if we took 15 
years to make Starcraft it'd be a great game, but only because we had 
to completely rewrite it every 2 years or so just to keep up with the 
changing technologies.
