&#62; Good to speak to ya again Adam.  Heh.  Sorry to bust yer bubble, but 
&#62; I think there was a fake Adam M post in there somewhere, but about 40 
&#62; people jumped on the gimp who did it, so thats okay.  You do realise 
&#62; that all manner of maniacs, (probably me included when I get bored 
&#62; enough...) are going to come after you as an insider to the workings 
&#62; of Blizzard, so you won't get much peace.  Just a question, the 
&#62; voices from War 2 were done by the programmers, and fucking good they 
&#62; were too.  This may be a stretch, but do you think you could tell us 
&#62; who from the above list did what, and the same for the released SC 
&#62; sounds?  It would be interesting to find out that the guy who did the 
&#62; Ogres also did the SCV captain, etc...  I may be totally cocked up, 
&#62; (its happened before...) but I'm guessing that since the only three 
&#62; possibilities as I see them for good old female programmers are ye 
&#62; Dana, Lim, and perhaps at a stretch Pat, (we never did get a concrete 
&#62; answer for that...) I'm guessing one of these three did the dropship 
&#62; voice.  The basic rumour is that you didn't have many female units 
&#62; due to lack of female programmers to voice them.  There may be other 
&#62; reasons...  Another rumour is that the game is taking so long because 
&#62; of the unbelievable beauty of the female programmers you do have, 
&#62; people are having difficulty concentrating... (Note: Not meant in a 
&#62; sexist way, meant in a FUNNY way.  Christ, gotta be careful these 
&#62; days...)
&#62; 
&#62; Good Luck Adam, whatever your doing now.

I'm glad I missed the fake (Pat did you delete that?).  Until YOU 
burst my bubble I was feeling quite good about the forums. ;)  
Seriously though, to answer your questions (which don't seem to be 
giving any info away that would hurt Blizzard in any way) though...  
Only one of the people you mentioned is female.  As for the voices... 
 In War2 almost all of the voices were done by folks at Blizzard, I'm 
not sure who did the Ogre, but it was probably Stu, one of Blizzard's 
artists (and a damn good one too).  The Starcraft voices weren't done 
by any of the programmers or artists as far as I know though...  
Let's see...  Metzen did the voice of teh DeathKnight as well as a 
few others I can't remember now...  I think that's the only person in 
teh above list to do voices...
