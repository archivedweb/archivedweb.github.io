&#62; &#62;   Sinec the dropships can drop bombs they should be upgradable to

&#62; &#62; he screen and look at the destroyed buildings.  Your droship would 
&#62; &#62; probally di in the explosion but if you blew up all there guys what 
&#62; &#62; the hell.  Of course youwould have to research Atomic bombs first and 
&#62; &#62; then upgrade to them then buy each one.  They would be really 
&#62; &#62; expensive so you could have 3 dropshps and blow up half of the map.

&#62; Hmmm...
&#62; I wonder if this would be such a great idea.
&#62; Look at the abombs in RA(or C&C for that matter).
&#62; I think abombs suck.
&#62; And if they were powerful enough to take units and buildings out in 
&#62; one hit they would really suck.
&#62; Imagine having built a great base and having way more forces than the 
&#62; other guy.
&#62; Then somehow he sneaks in with two lousy guys and your almost dead.
&#62; Wouldnt be all that funny would it?
&#62; Please Bliz if you have abombs at least make it an option to turn 
&#62; them off, because Im sure im not the only one who 
&#62; wanna be able to win by supperior numbers and tactics without having 
&#62; to think about the risc of my entire army being
&#62; eniolated in 1 sec by ONE lousy ship.

Nuclear bombs in space would not do much damage at all, compared to 
when they are detonated in an atmosphere.  Since there is no air for 
the shockwave to travel through, the bomb would be very muffled, have 
a small blast radius etc.  The radiation would only affect the Zerg, 
everyone else has shielding.  The whole concept of super weapons is 
okay with me, if you let some sucker spend 10,000 credits on some 
mega-device and you arn't able to stop him even though you have 
10,000 credits more in troops, then you deserve to loose.</pre>
