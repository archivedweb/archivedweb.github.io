&#62; &#62; 1 afternoon?  Why the hell would you sit by your computer doing 
&#62; &#62; nothing while DLing?  MOST people do something else while waiting.
&#62; 
&#62; I agree here, go watch brave heart or something, its a kick
&#62; ass movie :)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; As unique as they were historically.  Militarily speaking, ancient 
&#62; &#62; civs weren't that different.  For example, at some point most used 
&#62; &#62; chariots, then later heavy infantry groups, etc.  These kids keep 
&#62; &#62; expecting to find orcs and ogres in a historical sim. 
&#62; 
&#62; actually, no, but i think that the orcs where more resemblant of the
&#62; vikings &#60;yep this is a major stretch&#62;.  Orcs fit the story 
&#62; line better
&#62; though ;)...

I was thinking more along the lines of Huns, Visgoths, or Vandals for 
the Orcs.

&#62; 
&#62; I dont recall elephants ever being used in warfare, and does it seem
&#62; strange to anyone else that they could build fishing boats before they
&#62; learned to use tools, hehehe....

Do Hannibal or Hamilcar ring a bell?  
 
&#62; &#62; If there is a difference, then they are not identical.  Ever notice 
&#62; &#62; the Hittites' War Galley has +6 range, and the Egyptians +0?  
&#62; 
&#62; i believe they also get an archer range bonus or something.  The
&#62; problem here is, although they have bonuses, they do have the same
&#62; units, which does fit in with historical sim.  But i find fantasy
&#62; funner.

Ship range bonus for the Hittites, Egyptians have stronger chariots 
and something else. 


&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Not really.  the only resembelance is that you use villagers to 
&#62; &#62; gather resources.
&#62; 
&#62; I aint gonna touch this one.  How bout we just call all rts's
&#62; dune 2 clones :)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; That is why you play against humans.  They know how to counter these 
&#62; &#62; things.  
&#62; 
&#62; It is funner to play against real people, i rarely ever play computers
&#62; in any game that has multiple players.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; It IS a reasonable limit, since MOST GOOD HUMAN PLAYERS can use their 
&#62; &#62; units more effectively than the AI.  The size of the demo was mostly 
&#62; &#62; for the graphics.  
&#62; 
&#62; The limit is not exactly reasonable, i can easily build 50 villagers
&#62; i hate having to kill things off just so i can build more useful
&#62; units.

you don't NEED 50 villagers.  15-25 should be the most.

  Have you ever read up on some of the armies in this game
&#62; they wheren't by any means small, some thousands large... just
&#62; thought i'd bring that up

People would whine even more if you had to do tactical combat with 
1000s of units.

&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Netstorm sucks.  It is like C&C, minus strategy, and plus lame units. 
&#62; &#62;  All it is is sandbagging from C&C made into the main part of the 
&#62; &#62; game.
&#62; 
&#62; I played early versions of netstorm, its wasnt too bad, except that
&#62; it becomes unbalanced huge if you fight against people with a higher
&#62; rating then you.

Netstorm SUCKED.  I fell asleep while I was playing it.  It is 
nothing but C&C sandbagging being the only thing, and a child's 
puzzle block sidegame thrown in.  
 
&#62; &#62; Too many of you lamer kids play AOE, and expect orcs, ogres, zerg, 
&#62; &#62; and God knows what else.  You won't find these.  What you will find 
&#62; &#62; is an EXCELLENT historicaly accurate game.  It isn't meant to have 
&#62; &#62; races that are diverse.  They have their differences that alter 
&#62; &#62; playstyle.  It also requires THINKING, which is why some of you don't 
&#62; &#62; like C&C1, LOTR2, etc., because they are too much for your little 
&#62; &#62; brain to handle.  Rapid mouse clicking, not thinking, is all you 
&#62; &#62; brats can do.  And the sad thing is most of you suck at that, too.
&#62; 
&#62; brats, hmmmmm, rapid mouse clicking?  i cant believe how many people
&#62; say war2 was a click fest.  If you ever used humans, you had to
&#62; use all the units, decide when and where to hit, use the spells
&#62; and other such &#34;clickings&#34;.

Then hte Orc player clicks 3 times, and the speed is on full, and he 
jsut clicks on Ogre as fast as he can, and can win.  

 And despite what you all might 
&#62; think,
&#62; AOE is just as much of a click fest as any other game.

Not really.  In games like Warcrap2, clicking fast is a substitute 
for thinking fast.  Not so in AOE, and REAL strategy games.</pre>
