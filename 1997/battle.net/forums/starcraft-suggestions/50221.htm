<pre>On Thu Nov 6 21:08 PM, Rob wrote:
&#62; Please answer the following or post a reply stating that they are 
&#62; being saved for the uberlist. I have posted them before but noone 
&#62; responded.
&#62; 
&#62; 1 ) Playing the zerg, if my terran opponent abandons auxillary 
&#62; structures by moving his primary structure elsewhere, are the 
&#62; auxillary structures themselves infestable or are only primary 
&#62; structures infestiable?
&#62; 

I'll see what I can find out about this.


&#62; 2 )  if creep is destroyable, and all creep around a zerg building is 
&#62; destroyed EXCEPT the building itself is left intact, will the 
&#62; building create more creep and eventually redevelop the destroyed 
&#62; creep? Or will the creep-destroyed area be rendered permenantly 
&#62; uncreepable (sorta like nuclear meltdowns creating uninhabitable 
&#62; areas in Sim City)?
&#62;    a) If Terrans order a nuclear strike at a zerg area, assumedly 
&#62;        the creep there would be destroyed. As this more closely 
&#62;        resembles the circumstances of that Sim City meltdown 
&#62;        allusion, do nuked areas become uninhabitable to the zerg 
&#62;        (creep) or other races? Or does nuking have solely a damage 
&#62;        effect?
&#62; 

Creep will regrow if it is destroyed (and there is something nearby 
that regrows creep).

&#62; 3 ) Does creep have hit points and armour levels? Is there a 
&#62; quantifable amount of damage creep does to non-zerg standing on it 
&#62; (beyond that generated by the attacks of the lurker) and a 
&#62; quantifiable amount of damage it can take before it is destroyed? If 
&#62; so, can creep hit points/armour level/attack effects be upgraded?
&#62; 

Hm...yes, creep can take a certain amount of damage before being 
destroyed, though I don't think it can be increased through upgrades. 
 I'll check on this for you.



&#62; 4 ) If a terran unit was left standing right next to creep (but not 
&#62; on it), and if that unit was ignored by its player, could the creep 
&#62; eventually 'creep' under him? Or would it surround him but not be 
&#62; under him?
&#62; 

Hm...that's another good question :)

&#62; 5 ) Likewise, would that unit in the above question automatically 
&#62; attack creep that comes in range of his weapons systems? 
&#62;

No.

 
&#62; 6 ) Can lurkers strike at units adjacent to creep or must the unit be 
&#62; physically on it? Moreover, can lurkers attack flying units hovering 
&#62; or traveling over creep?
&#62; 
&#62; 7 ) When creep is attacked, does the zerg player get a zerg-
&#62; equivalent  'our town is under attack' sound warning? Or does that 
&#62; only occur when actual zerg buildings are attacked?
&#62; 

You'll find out about these soon enough ;)

&#62; 8 ) How are building relocation commands handled? I mean, if I order 
&#62; my structure to move to point B (at the time of the order
&#62; point B is clear of creep, other units, trees and obstacles), but in 
&#62; transit some foreign unit (or my own) comes to occupy that landing 
&#62; space, will the structure automatically land in the space nearest to 
&#62; point B that is available? Will it return automatically to its take 
&#62; off point?   Will it hover above point B until it receives an 
&#62; explicit new landing location or until point B is cleared off again?
&#62;

A Terran building won't land anywhere you don't tell it to land.

&#62; 9 ) Do any Terran buildings have defense systems that continue to (or 
&#62; solely) operate while the building is in-flight?
&#62;

Don't think so -- I'll check.
 
&#62; 10 ) Do power stations continue to generate power while they are in 
&#62; flight? (Assumedly they would as their solar cells are still
&#62; absorbing solar energy). 
&#62;      a) If they dont function, do anchored buildings suffer 
&#62;          power outtages while power stations move?
&#62;       b) If they function, why would I ever want to land them (and 
&#62;            be vulnerable to land and air attack) when I could set 
&#62;            them flying along an endless path of waypoints (or 
&#62;            patroll) perhaps over trees or water so that they are 
&#62;            vulnerable by air only?
&#62;

Actually, these buildings don't move.
 
&#62; 11 ) Part b above leads to the next rational question: Are there 
&#62; limitations on building movement capacity? That is, can a building be 
&#62; in the air for only 'x' seconds (maybe it has only 'y' amount of 
&#62; fuel) such that it has no choice but to land? Or, on the other hand, 
&#62; can buildings remain airborn indefinately?
&#62;

Nope, they can stay up as long as they need to.  However, they lose 
their functionality while flying.
 
&#62; 12 ) I assume the blue rift that appears in one of the screenshots is 
&#62; a protos building in-progress (being teleported from protos 
&#62; homeworld). Is this correct? Can units attack the 'blue rift' and 
&#62; damage the transporting building?
&#62;

Yes, though the &#34;shimmer&#34; effect is not too long.
 
&#62; 13) Is building-teleportation near instantaneous or is there a 
&#62; comperable 'phase in' period simular to teran building construction 
&#62; time and zerg building gestation time?
&#62;       a) What of protos units? Are their teleportation from the
&#62;            homeworld upon demand near instantaneous?
&#62; 

Yes, it does take time to bring in the Protoss structures.

&#62; 14 ) Assuming all races have one sort or another of 'building time' 
&#62; associated with building new buildings, are any of the races given a 
&#62; particular advantage in having particularly fast build-times relative 
&#62; to the other races? Or are the three races fairly equal relative to 
&#62; eachother and the complexity of the building being built?
&#62;

The is a difference in building times for structures, though no 
species has a has a huge advantage in this area (but remember the 
building limitations of each race).

 
&#62; 15 ) If Protos have teleportation technology, one would think they 
&#62; could teleport units directly into enemy encampments/behind enemy 
&#62; defenses. How is it rationalized that they can not? If the answer 
&#62; involves the need of a pre-existing structure to be the target of the 
&#62; telportation, how does the first Protos structure (I assume the 
&#62; Nexus) get to a given planet considering no pre-existing structures 
&#62; existed for it to teleport to?
&#62; 

Protoss probes can be used be gate in a Nexus, and this Nexus can be 
the hub for a Protoss energy net (for info on this, please see the 
Starcraft FAQ under Species information).

&#62; 16 ) Can orders be erased from a unit's order que out of order?  
&#62; Meaning, if I have qued 6 orders to some unit production facility 
&#62; (the 3rd of which is to produce a firebat), and I decide I no longer 
&#62; wish to produce that firebat, can I delete/change the 3rd order 
&#62; without altering the surrounding orders in the que? For that matter, 
&#62; can you expand on how flexible the que is to alteration?
&#62;

You can cancel the order to produce a unit in the middle of the 
queue.  It's very easy to create such a queue with the interface, and 
there is no penalty for this.  
 
&#62; 17 ) On unit movement/interaction with buildings: In warcraft2 one 
&#62; could inadvertently build unit 'traps' where newly constructed units 
&#62; are surrounded by buildings/natural obstacles and cannot get out. 
&#62; Simmularly, peons at times found themselves trapped after building 
&#62; new buildings. Has this bug (in my opinion -- as it is very 
&#62; unrealistic) been dealt with in starcraft? Assumedly buildings would 
&#62; have walking spaces inside them and surrounding them inherant to its 
&#62; space through which units can move -- not needing to be manually 
&#62; maintaned by the player. I suppose the question is, can small ground 
&#62; units travel between two buildings built adjacent to eachother?
&#62;

Units can't move through buildings, but you shouldn't have too much 
trouble with them getting stuck.  Flying transports can carry units 
out of sticky situations.

&#62; 18 ) Considering wood no longer is a resource, I assume it is still 
&#62; possible to clear trees and the like to make room for building 
&#62; expansion? 
&#62;   a)Can any unit attack/destroy terrain or does that require special 
&#62;      units? What terrain can be altered/destroyed and what cannot? Do 
&#62;      terrain features have hit-point equivalency or is it more like 
&#62; 'one 
&#62;      shot destroys it' type of thing?
&#62;    b)Can Terran SCV's and Protos shuttles be ordered to build 
&#62;      buildings on forested areas (rationally speaking, especially in 
&#62; the 
&#62;      future, one would think SCV's and shuttles could handle routine 
&#62; tree-
&#62;      clearing to prep a space for a building they are creating).
&#62;      If they can't, what's the logic? I can't see how advanced races 
&#62;      couldn't figure out how to get rid of trees without breaking a 
&#62; sweat.
&#62; 

I'll look into your questions concerning terrain.

&#62; 19 ) So far, the only mention of exploding units have been biproducts 
&#62; of defilers and possibly infested terrans. Do exploding units do 
&#62; damage to terrain features?
&#62; 
&#62; 20 ) Is there any way to alter terrain (in actual gameplay) to 
&#62; produce bridges between levels? For example, can you do something 
&#62; like walk an exploding unit up to a cliff such that when it explodes 
&#62; it collapses some of the cliff face making a 'ramp' linking the lower 
&#62; level to that at the cliff's top? 
&#62; 
&#62; 21 ) Age of Empires, etc all have hotkeys for grouping units, but 
&#62; I've found (in AoE and Warcraft II) it would likewise be useful to be 
&#62; able to set hotkeys or have commands for particular unit FORMATIONS. 
&#62; Such that 'group objects' (pardon the object orientedness of the 
&#62; question) would have their own formation commands/functions that 
&#62; isolated units would not have. Does Starcraft attempt to deal with 
&#62; this in any way or will this have to wait for the likes of Warcraft 
&#62; III and other post-starcraft cutting edge RTS games?
&#62; 
&#62; 22) Suggestion: I know this sounds silly and slightly absurd, but I 
&#62; strongly suggest the addition of a peon equivalent hero or two!! Not 
&#62; only for the huge potential comic element of having a 
&#62; superpeon/scv/shuttle/drone, but also because it makes a bold 
&#62; statement and could augment gameplay.. a 'superpeon' might have 
&#62; significantly increased 'building' rates and 'gathering' capacity. 
&#62;

Working-class hero!  I'll forward it :)
 
&#62; 23 ) Battlenet question. Is there any way to 'reset' your statistics 
&#62; or are they permenant? Likewise is there any way to 'delete' your 
&#62; username from the Battlenet annals (besides through it happening 
&#62; automatically do to inactivity)? Logic being if I wanted to start 
&#62; anew with my current name and there was no reset function I'd delete 
&#62; myself and re-register the same username immediately after. 
&#62; 

It will be possible to create a new battle.net account, though the 
details on this have not been completely hammered out.

&#62; 24 ) Also on Battlenet. While tracking wins-losses-disconnects is 
&#62; certainly a nifty way of assessing opponents, its limitted in that it 
&#62; reflects overall historical data (assumedly including the user's 
&#62; newbie games) as opposed to adequately expressing his current 
&#62; ability. That is, if Lothar has 50 wins and 50 losses, I have no idea 
&#62; if he's an average player who wins half the time or a kick-ass player 
&#62; who lost his first 50 games but has won every one since. Does 
&#62; Battlenet also provide 'Last 10 games' information (or anything 
&#62; simular, like providing dates with wins/losses) from which I can see 
&#62; the results of a potential opponent's RECENT forays and assess his 
&#62; CURRENT ability?
&#62;

Statistics are a good way to represent real world objects (or 
players, as the case may be), but there's nothing that tells you more 
about the skill of a player than an actual game with the player.  If 
you are not sure about a players skill, then a game with them might 
be considered.


&#62; 25 ) How do you decide which questions to answer, which to ignore, 
&#62; and which to save for the uberlists? Is there a certain criteria you 
&#62; use? I ask because I've posted these questions before but they were 
&#62; not responded to -- either with explicit answers or statements 
&#62; suggesting they would be answered in the next uberlist.

There is no hard rules for the questions answered here.  We do try to 
answer new questions or ones that haven't been answered by other 
forumers (thanks for the help, people).  We also usually don't answer 
too many questions asked on the weekend, though that's not always the 
case :)
