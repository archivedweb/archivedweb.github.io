<blockquote>
<pre>    I would just love to go into a game and watch. 
This is a concept i was kinda hopin you guys would come
up with. I heard of it somewhere.
    If this does happen, does that mean i can just go 
and watch any game i want to? Or do you have to set it up
when the game is started? And, of course, there can be an 
option to turn off the ability for people to watch the game.
But like in a ladder game, that would be almost the best 
thing to do if you wanted to make sure that the truth is
known about a game. 
    And you could add a feature that disables talking during 
a game or enabling it, whatever. Most likely, if this does 
happen, people will always disable this option because who
knows who is watchin. 
    And of course, some questions for ya:
    1/ Are there any units that can repair or heal other units?

    2/ If so, could a unit's kills add a small addition of 
damage the unit inflicts?
    3/ How many ships can a cloaking ship make cloaked? And
can they cloak land units, too?
    4/ Do camoflauged zergs still have the same range of sight
below the surface?
    5/ Can underground zerg patrol or at least attack an upcoming
threat and then be told to go underground when you first give them 
the command to borrow. Like waypoints. so that means that the zerg 
will be under ground, then something comes by, the zerg kills it,
then goes back underground and regenerates or whatever to its
next victom comes to meet its doom. This would work better if there
was a lot more underground zerg units and a variety of them.
    6/ Allies can cloak another ally of a different race right?
Like in war2, you could make anything invisible i think.
    7/ I have a more influensive way to make people construct more
'farm'like buildings. The more 'grown', the more healthy each unit 
gets. Like a hurt unit will eventually get better with the more
'grown'. It heals faster as more is grown.
    8/ What the hell do broodlings do? I guess they help protect
the queen or whatever that produces them with corrosive spit or 
something.hehe
    9/ Do drones fly or crawl? Does it decrease the size the creep
takes up when a drone is transformed into a building? 
   10/ That would be nice to have a number of creep supplies someone
has to use for making buildings. 

   I liked what that one person said about programming units. Heres
a scenario in war2 you could use i guess.
    1) Ogres around the enemy camp lust up.
    2) Deathnights decay for 30 mana on each tower.
    3) 3 ogres rush in to attack peons gettin gold.
    4) 6 ogres from the same spot hit the defenders as they run
       after the first 3 ogres
    5) From the other side of the camp, all ogres rush in to 
       destroy in order: the blacksmith, the ogre mound, then any 
       barracks near to those buildings
    6) While destroying the town have fliers scout for any possible
       units trying to escape.
    7) Have ogres around any expansions with barracks to lust up and 
       start patrolling in case of reinforcements from other enemies
       tryin to save the expansions that the person has left.
    8) After the ogres stop fighting at the demolished base, have 
       like 3/4 go back to your most valuable base to await a 
       couterattack.
   Now if your allies do the same thing, then you just have to say 
when. Then POW, game over. Because, most likely the teams are even.
you could even have it so that in a sea level you could have trans-
ports full of sappers come in and get rid of their junk as you are 
fighting their jugs or something. Of course who would go to the 
trouble to set this up. I guess they could do it after a failed 
attack by an opponent who is trying to rebuild an army. 
    This is kinda long isnt it? I just wanted to use my two posts
an hour thoroughly. And i think i acheived that a while ago. 
Blizzard, if you could, answer some of these questions.Please.

    - Who really cares who i am? if you want to know, then reply

P.S. I would rather you worry about gettin the game out asap 
     instead of reading these suggestions. Even mine. If you
     are even checkin this thing anymore! hehe :&#62;</pre>
