&#62; &#62; Ok Blizzard I have 3 questions
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The first is about battle.net. Can we reserve rooms in battle.net for 
&#62; &#62; a certain period of time (like 3 months)? If we can will we be able 
&#62; &#62; to certify a list of users that is allowed in? And also if we can 
&#62; &#62; reserve rooms will it cost money?
&#62; 
&#62; I think that it has been said that guilds/clans/etc. will be able to 
&#62; have &#34;chat&#34; rooms like they can on battlenet with Diablo.  I 
&#62; doubt that they would object to doing the same with Starcraft...
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; My second question is: Can you specify who is on whose team before 
&#62; &#62; you start the match or will it be like RA where you get in the game 
&#62; &#62; and then ally with people?
&#62; 
&#62; From what I understand, teams are choosen before the game begins...I 
&#62; am not sure if you can still ally with people after action has 
&#62; begun...that would only make sense, since you can make and break 
&#62; alliances throughout the game...
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; My last question is: Can teams be all one color or will each person 
&#62; &#62; have to be their own seperate color?
&#62; 
&#62; From what I understand, Teammates share everything units, buildings, 
&#62; and also color.  Allies, on the other hand, will have separate 
&#62; colors...
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; I am asking all of these questions because I am the one holding the 
&#62; &#62; Starcraft Tournament where you play on teams of 2 vs. other teams of 
&#62; &#62; 2. I really need this information and I would very much appreciate it 
&#62; &#62; if you replied to this. Thanks 
&#62; 
&#62; Hope the above helped.  BTW I am almost 100&#37; sure about the 
&#62; above...
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; NOTE: All spots are filled in the tournament but if you want to join 
&#62; &#62; a team you can sign up at : <a href="http://free.prohosting.com/~blades">http://free.prohosting.com/~blades</a>

Overseer,

Yep, you're right, though I think Blade Runner wanted to know of 
clans could actually own channels over battle.net, and this might 
require further explanation.  We are still working out the details 
for clan/guild/etc support on battle.net, but this is the way it 
works on battle.net right now:  It is possible to create a channel 
and have your clan use it, but non-clan members can also join and use 
that channel.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
