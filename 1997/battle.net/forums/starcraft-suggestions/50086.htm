&#62; &#62;    I have heard about the leagues and ladders or whatever 
&#62; &#62; for a while. I want to know how I can get into a clan that isnt
&#62; &#62; confined to one race(I dont know which one will be my favorite,
&#62; &#62; and neither should anyone else except for the programmers
&#62; &#62; because THE GAME ISNT OUT YET!). If there are any clans or 
&#62; &#62; whatever that do limit a person to one race, what is with you?
&#62; &#62; I mean, when I started playing war2, I always wanted to play 
&#62; &#62; as humans. After a while though, as what happens to many people,
&#62; &#62; I grew to always play orcs(except for nw2r nw2h, I dont know 
&#62; &#62; what I like about the humans there. I guess its their upgrades).
&#62; &#62;     So if any of you people out there want a new recruit, I'm
&#62; &#62; your guy. If so just reply and hopefully I'll look at this asap.
&#62; &#62; If you do reply to this, tell some stuff about your &#34;clan&#34;, 
&#62; &#62; just
&#62; &#62; in case there is more than one reply.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Join the StarRaiders.  We have an open door policy where you can 
&#62; select your race.   We only request one thing in return.  That you 
&#62; have ICQ.  That is a little program that lets everyone communicate 
&#62; better.  Check out our website at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Lair/9247/">http://www.geocities.com/Lair/9247/</a> 
&#62; .   You also become a member of the ASA with this membership.  This 
&#62; is totally free..
&#62; Say hey. recruited you please.  THX.
&#62; hey. (SR)(ASA)
&#62; join the starraiders and the asa.   email me about the asa and go to 
&#62; the above website to join the starraiders.


Hehe just to tell you you sorta spelled your page wrong its 
TimesSquare/Lair/9247 not
just Lair/9247. Well hope whats his name knew that though. If your 
lucky he did. But if he
didn't heres my page <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/4111">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Lair/4111</a> 
and by the way
does the AsA even need a web page kinda sounds pointless to me why 
you may ask heres some reasons:

Won't making a page for the AsA take time away from the guild leaders 
doing their pages?

Won't it also be pretty much dead once Starcraft comes out nobody 
will be coming here anymore everyone will be going to Diablo
2's forum.

Why are the Star Raiders having a &#34; friendly war&#34; with the 
Star Commanders and is that possible? Think about it a &#34;friendly 
war&#34;.

Isn't the LoS and Star Raiders in the AsA. And yes they are. But how 
come LoS is allied with The StarCommanders and I guess allied with 
The Star Raiders; but The Star Raiders and the Star Commanders 
enemies at least from their pages. So isn't that kinda of a weird 
war/enemy thing going?

And how many guilds are acctually in the AsA?

And heres a personal question &#34;Hey&#34;, um... why that for your 
name?

Oh yeah no more arguing with Gunslayer ((( both ))) of you took up 
alot of forum space.

Last but not least I'm getting a new computer which I'm very happy 
about. 

Besides that though good luck with all the guilds. 8?)</pre>
