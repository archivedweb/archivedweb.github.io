&#62; &#62; HEY FOOL
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Where did you learn english?
&#62; &#62; Or do you just not know how to type?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Stay off this page you illiterate sob
&#62;       Well, if we are going to bust people for misspelling and 
&#62; incorrect grammar, YOU better get off the page.  Maybe we should 
&#62; force people how to punctuate after every sentence, ie 'Stay off this 
&#62; page you illiterate sob'   Do you see punctuation?  I know that I do 
&#62; not see any in that sentence.  Also, for all the people who call him 
&#62; stupid and say they cannot understand his writing, maybe you are the 
&#62; ones who need to work on their English.  After all, it is not that 
&#62; hard to understand if you know how to read.  Well, I guess my point 
&#62; is that we do not need to flame people who are different than 
&#62; ourselves and may not be as profficient in the English language as 
&#62; many of you think you are.  Everyone should have their own voice, 
&#62; even people who cannot go a few hours without flaming someone.  
&#62; Everyone should be able to post on this forum, and if you do not like 
&#62; how they write, then keep away from their posts.   Every time this 
&#62; guy writes, there are people flaming him.  If you all cannot stand 
&#62; him, why do you still bother to read his posts?  Maybe he also is not 
&#62; truly as 'illiterate' or 'moronic' as you think.  Just remember, you 
&#62; snobs, not everyone in this world is the same as you and we should 
&#62; not take offense to what they have to say and how they say it.  Who 
&#62; knows?  Maybe this person is smarter than all of us and s/he just 
&#62; does not speak English as a first, second, or maybe even third 
&#62; language.  Maybe s/he is just not very good with English, but does 
&#62; that rule out this person being intelligent and having good ideas.  
&#62; Maybe you need to take a good hard look at yourself.  I am not trying 
&#62; to 'flame' anyone at all, I am just attempting to convince anyone who 
&#62; does flame for grammar and punctuation mistakes not to.  Go ahead and 
&#62; flame them if you must, but you just make yourself look the fool.
&#62; 
&#62; Vossman[DN]
&#62; P.S.- I do not care if you find mistakes in my grammar or punctuation 
&#62; because I typed this up in haste in a minute or so.
&#62; Oh yes, and we all know how educated the 'YOUR MOM' flames are, if 
&#62; you think only educated people belong here.

Hey Vossman, 

I have to agree with Your Mom (hehe), that Fish guy is a total idiot. 
I mean in the beginning he was funny
but now it's just getting annoying. He keeps on going on about nuking 
a cat. Sure i laughed but the joke
is getting old fast.</pre>
