<pre>Scroll up to the top of the forum and what do you see?  a sign that 
says &#34;Starcraft Suggestions&#34;
Big Rob came up with a suggestion and suggested it.
And it is not impossible.  What are your computer programming 
credentials that you declared something impossible??
Here is why it is impossible.

War2, i am almost positive, stores the data in a 2 dimensional array. 
right?  like a 128x128 map is a square array with 128 squares on each 
side of a grid, creating a coordinate system.  Now, with that in 
mind, you can find out the coordinates of every square on the map and 
what is located on that square.  (this is all really easy to do) for 
instace, in the box 67x45 there is a tree which is represented by the 
number 4 (i don't know what the real numbers are, this is just an 
example of how the data would be stored, maybe 1 for water, 2 for 
unbuildable land, 3 for buildable land, etc)  Then you could read in 
the coordinates for each square on the map (the pud file) and then 
you place a similar object in the coresponding area of a scm file.  
the gold mines could transfer into gas mines, etc.  and the trees 
could translate into sc trees.  It doesn't need to be a 1-to-1 
translation the map surface, for instance it would ignore oil 
deposits and just put water onto the corresponding area on the scm.  
The coordinates don't even have to be the same, just a translation of 
them with a math formula (easy to do).  The resulting scm file would 
only be on 1 level, and you might have to touch it up manually a 
little so all the different resources are included, but it is not 
impossible.
Think before you flame.  And even if it was impossible at least it 
shows that Big Rob is thinking and using this forum for what is was 
meant, suggestions.

There i am done now

&#62; The reason why no one has suggested it yet is because it is 
&#62; impossible!!! not only does starcraft use different resources, but 
&#62; the lasat is completely different. for one thing, War2 has no hills, 
&#62; and no cliffs!! It is completely flat! Starcraft has hills, gullies, 
&#62; vallies, and all other geographical things. Thats not even including 
&#62; that some maps aren't even set on a planet!!!!!
