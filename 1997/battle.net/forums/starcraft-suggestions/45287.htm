<pre>&#62; 1 afternoon?  Why the hell would you sit by your computer doing 
&#62; nothing while DLing?  MOST people do something else while waiting.

I agree here, go watch brave heart or something, its a kick
ass movie :)

&#62; As unique as they were historically.  Militarily speaking, ancient 
&#62; civs weren't that different.  For example, at some point most used 
&#62; chariots, then later heavy infantry groups, etc.  These kids keep 
&#62; expecting to find orcs and ogres in a historical sim. 

actually, no, but i think that the orcs where more resemblant of the
vikings &#60;yep this is a major stretch&#62;.  Orcs fit the story 
line better
though ;)...

I dont recall elephants ever being used in warfare, and does it seem
strange to anyone else that they could build fishing boats before they
learned to use tools, hehehe....

&#62; If there is a difference, then they are not identical.  Ever notice 
&#62; the Hittites' War Galley has +6 range, and the Egyptians +0?  

i believe they also get an archer range bonus or something.  The
problem here is, although they have bonuses, they do have the same
units, which does fit in with historical sim.  But i find fantasy
funner.

&#62; Not really.  the only resembelance is that you use villagers to 
&#62; gather resources.

I aint gonna touch this one.  How bout we just call all rts's
dune 2 clones :)

&#62; That is why you play against humans.  They know how to counter these 
&#62; things.  

It is funner to play against real people, i rarely ever play computers
in any game that has multiple players.

&#62; It IS a reasonable limit, since MOST GOOD HUMAN PLAYERS can use their 
&#62; units more effectively than the AI.  The size of the demo was mostly 
&#62; for the graphics.  

The limit is not exactly reasonable, i can easily build 50 villagers
i hate having to kill things off just so i can build more useful
units.  Have you ever read up on some of the armies in this game
they wheren't by any means small, some thousands large... just
thought i'd bring that up

&#62; Netstorm sucks.  It is like C&C, minus strategy, and plus lame units. 
&#62;  All it is is sandbagging from C&C made into the main part of the 
&#62; game.

I played early versions of netstorm, its wasnt too bad, except that
it becomes unbalanced huge if you fight against people with a higher
rating then you.

&#62; Too many of you lamer kids play AOE, and expect orcs, ogres, zerg, 
&#62; and God knows what else.  You won't find these.  What you will find 
&#62; is an EXCELLENT historicaly accurate game.  It isn't meant to have 
&#62; races that are diverse.  They have their differences that alter 
&#62; playstyle.  It also requires THINKING, which is why some of you don't 
&#62; like C&C1, LOTR2, etc., because they are too much for your little 
&#62; brain to handle.  Rapid mouse clicking, not thinking, is all you 
&#62; brats can do.  And the sad thing is most of you suck at that, too.

brats, hmmmmm, rapid mouse clicking?  i cant believe how many people
say war2 was a click fest.  If you ever used humans, you had to
use all the units, decide when and where to hit, use the spells
and other such &#34;clickings&#34;. And despite what you all might 
think,
AOE is just as much of a click fest as any other game.  if your going
for non-click^fest, dont play &#34;real time&#34; strategy games, play
turn based, now thats true strategy...
