<pre>27)  Air Craft Carriers.  These would be like flying transports for 
ships.  I don't think that the Dropships could hold like wraiths and 
stuff, so this would help by holding a bunch of ships.  Not like th 
protoss carrie, this could hold any kind of flying ships.

28) Repairs.  There should be some building that could take in and 
repair your troops and units.  This would be like the heal spell
 but only accessable by the building.  Or a medic station.

29) Catacombs.  Zerg should have Catacombs where they could hatch in 
large numbers, this would be like having multiple barracks in one 
building.  With like 10 spots select one and tell it to grow a 
certain unit.  This would help the hording.

30) Space travel.  In space you shouldn't stop when you end the 
command because in space you don't do that.  So a ship would stay on 
its present course and you would have to curve back and attack again. 
 This would add a sense of reality.

31) Inerplanetary Travel.  There should be some way to travel to 
another planet in the same map.  You could start outon a planet and 
grow then go into space and find a new planet.  You should just go up 
from your current potions and be in space and be able to go back into 
the aptmosphere.

32) Battle.net Books.  There should be some feature on B.net that 
lets you make books that indenify your friends and foes.  This would 
be cool and have an auto sereach for them.

33) Mega beam.  the protoss should use their psionic powers to build 
a mega Beam.  This ouwld be a building and it would have great power. 
 It would be needed to built on a hill top so the range could be 
increased.  This would give the Protoss a good thing to balance out.

34) Space Stations.  You should be able to construct space stations 
or mybe battle space station.  Like the death star.  That would be 
cool.  They would be very expensive, I mean 50000 gold (SC terms) so 
you could just build one for nothing.  This would be armed with guns 
and it would have the building that produces ships efect and the 
effect of barracks.

35) Satilite Strike.  You should be able to build a station on the 
ground that contacts a satilite launched into space by you and the 
satilite could target a spot.  You would coose he spot on he mini map 
and then it would strike.

36) Weather effects.  The weather would be random abd would be light 
or harsh waether.  Maybe if you would be on a planet with lava then 
maybe a crack would bust and magma would come poring out.  It add a 
non player hazard, which War2 didn't have.

37) Online maps.  before the start of each game the person that 
created it could choose the map seting.  Like theterrain or if it was 
dead space and then it would set it up and through the players to 
there staring spots.

38) Map chooser.  i think there should be a random map chooser but 
like it makes up the map complately and throughs together a bunch of 
ground and stuff.  It would an X amount of already made maps and it 
would pick from one of them.  This way you would have a real map and 
a playable map, but not the same one everytime.
