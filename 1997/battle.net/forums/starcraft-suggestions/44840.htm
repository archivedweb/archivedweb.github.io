<pre>Hey Cruddy Critters!!!

I hate it cause cruddy bloody lusty ogres always beat me and that 
stinks.  The other day I was playing as a human (always) and my 
partner was orcs and we were fighting a human and orc team.  Fairly 
balanced until my partner dropped and I was left to face them both.  
I was kickin the humans can and was about to beat him when I was 
attacked by, you guessed it.  Bloodlusted ogres.  *sigh*  Even my 
HUGH forces back home were no match for his cruddy bloody's...

Am I the only human critter left?

&#62; I was reading one of recent posts dealing with balanced sides. One of 
&#62; the replies pointed out that, it is a common mistake that most 
&#62; players see someone winning because of the race they choose and not 
&#62; because of their skill level. This has happen a lot in Warcraft 2, 
&#62; were bloodlusted ogres are viewed as the winning team.  However it 
&#62; got me thinking, are you guys at Blizzard gonna have it to were two 
&#62; or more AIs can fight amongst each other? Cause if you do... this 
&#62; would be a great way to also test balancing issues. You can set up 
&#62; two computers to fight each other with different species, and you 
&#62; just sit back and watch the game. Find out which AI will win... and 
&#62; figure out why it won and if it's necessary to do some more tweaking, 
&#62; etc... Just a suggestion :-)
