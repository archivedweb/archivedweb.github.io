&#62;    Alchemy--your back so soon.  I thought that with the horrible 
&#62; offence I gave to you and your mother that you might have left this 
&#62; Forum for good.  Wishful thinking on my part I suppose.  I have to 
&#62; admit your resolution is stronger than your pitiful little 
&#62; constitution eludes to.  Like a lemming racing it's fellow vermin to 
&#62; its watery grave. 



	Somms (Sad Obese Momma's boy Mad at Somebody),

  First you do a post saying that Alchemy's mom does sailors for five 
bucks a pop. Then Bliz vapes the post. Then you have the nerve to go 
after him again? Oh, brother. You are so pathetic. And you always 
seem to go after every one but me, Somms. Why is that?  Wimp.
  I'm sorry that the lithium has worn off, and that the mean men 
won't let you out of the jacket with the sleeves that tie in the 
back. And, sad to say, you probably get off on being disliked and 
disrespected. But ask yourself two questions, Somminex (so named 
because you bore everyone)

1-- Why do I, Somms, insult people so harshly that I don't even know?
2-- Why do I stay somewhere where I have totally humiliated myself as 
a person so often and so repeatedly?

	Show some honor, Somms. I know it's hard for you to understand that 
concept, but if you insulted my mother, I'd be saying you sucked too, 
and a whole lot more. I think Alchemy's display of restraint is 
rather remarkable. And it shows that he is a far stronger person than 
you. I guess you know that too, and can't stand the fact, which is 
why you go after the guy. Alchemy should feel rather complimented.
