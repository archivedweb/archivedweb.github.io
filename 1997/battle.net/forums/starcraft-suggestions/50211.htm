&#62; Here are some excerpts from the San Jose Mercury News review

&#62; &#34;...mind-numbingly dumb...&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;...drill a hole in your head and suck out your brain... then sit
&#62;  back and enjoy...&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;...full of cliches...&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;...pretty teeth...&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; The quotes go on and on. I think I may just wait for video,
&#62; or if I'm feeling like a real no-brainer I'll go see it.

Give me a break.  You've been brainwashed by the mass media and the 
movie critics.  I don't judge a movie until I see it, and frankly, if 
you use the excuse &#34;I don't feel like wasting four bucks&#34; 
then you're way too poor to own everything else in the first place.  
Starship Trooper is made to be a simple movie based on action, action 
and more action.  Just take it at that, and quit looking for DRAMATIC 
plots like the book, because it's not like that book.  Movie critics 
doesn't speak for everyone you know.  Certain people like certain 
movies.  Also, since critics do what they do for a living, you can't 
possible expect them to watch the movie from the point of view of the 
general public.  I mean, I don't go out to every movie and try to 
analyze it down to the actors hair.  Come on, what do you expect, 
Casablanca all over again?  Take a movie as it is and deal with it, 
critics are a hoax, period.

&#62; &#62; the movie has been considered bigger and better than star wars 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; it has Zerg like aliens
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; it has sex
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; it has brutality 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; it has comedy
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; alltogether it is a starcraft like perspective of the tarrens versus 
&#62; &#62; the Zerg after the Zerg first make themselves aware, the Terran's 
&#62; &#62; were supposed to wear armor like in the game but it was considered to 
&#62; &#62; expensive.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; ok it is not supposed to be a representation of starcraft but it is 
&#62; &#62; close enough for me.</pre>
