<pre>  I posted about 20 messages saying all my ideas and this one will 
have all them in one post. 

1) Jetpacks on the Terran marines.  They are upgradeable.  This would 
be for going up cliffs.

2) The Zerg can develope wings(like insect wings) and fly aroung.

3) Zerg spitters.  The Zerg can spit poison out and slowy reduce the 
life of the target or if its a metal unit the poison acts as asid and 
burns away at it.

4) Portals for the Protoss.  They can build two ends to a portal 
gnerator and placethem at other ends of the map.  This way they could 
transport their ships and units with out walking them all that way.

5) Protoss shield generator.  the could construct a shield generat 
and place next to their buildi ngs and they could be protected.  The 
shield would have a power meter and it would decrease as it was fired 
apon.  But the people that built it could move freely back and forth 
through the shield.

6) Zerg can climb.  they can climb up cliffs and jump down them.  
Landing on something would cause a lot of damage.

6) Tunneling Zergs.  They could tunnel under gournd and come up in 
the other players base.  Yo could control and see the Zerg as a dot 
on your screen but the other players couldn't see him at all.

7) Bridges.  You could build your own bridges across water.  This way 
you could have your units go across with out having transport take 
them all.  

8) Atomic bombs.  The Terran should have some super bomb maybe atomic 
or maybe antimatter.  the atomic could blow up on planets and the 
antimatter would be for space.

9) Capture.  You could nuild a holding cell and get some unit that 
can capture enimies and take them back.  While in thecapture unit and 
in the holding cell they couldn't attack.  The other player could 
destroy the holding cell and release the cptured guys though.

10) Jammers.  There should some way to jam the enimies signles so 
they could be found on the map.  You could have a jam placed on a 
goliath that went out to scout.  Then the other player couldn't see 
it on the mini map or the regular map.  The could dontrol it but they 
couldn't see where it is.  they would have to retrive it and take it 
back.  

11) Set formations.  You could have a bunch of wraiths and have them 
in a group and set it so they are in a &#34;V&#34; formation.  This 
way they could stay orgonized and look cool.

12) Fall our shelters.  You could build a fall out shleter and they 
would be half underground and half abive.  then when you get attacked 
you caould put your workers or othr troops in there.  

13) Armed building.  Buildings should have some kind of gun to defend 
them.  On top of them.  You would upgrade your Twon hall to have it.  
So in an attack your town hall would be like a guntower.

14) Spys.  You could send a spy unit into a base and it would be 
undectable unless they actually saw it.  

15) Shallow water.  Where there is water there should be apart thatis 
shallow and units could go through it.  

16) the dead race.  There should be alien ruins of a dead race that 
never appears in StarCraft.  You would find destroyed bases and 
crashed ships but none of them.  they should be the people that made 
the prtoss and the Zerg.  This would give something for StarCraft II 
to fllow up on.  The protoss and the Zerg ended up killing the people 
you made them, since their whole race was gentically enineered.

thats all thanX
