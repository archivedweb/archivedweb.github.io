<pre>Please make the AI better than Warcraft2 and Red Alert.  Here are 
some things that I didn't like about the Warcraft2 AI, and how to 
change it.

1.  Guys wouldn't run to a battle to help out if the unit didn't get 
attacked.  You should make the units automatically attack enemy units 
that are a certain distance from your buildings.  Or if there is a 
big 
battle and the unit is close enough it should head for the battle.

2.  Have something like a &#34;sentry spot.&#34;  What this would do 
is if a unit saw an enemy unit it would move close to it and attack, 
but if the enemy is stronger the unit on sentry would run back to the 
spot you selected.  This would be good for drawing enemy units to 
places more heavily defended than others.  Also if you have enough 
units on sentry they might kill the attackers before they set 
foot(tail) in your city.

3.  Patrol was a good option, but this time let all of the flying 
units have it.

4.  If a unit is damaged and is close enough to a repair unit or 
building, it will go get itself repaired(unless it is in the middle 
of a battle).

5.  I like the idea of something like a bombing zone.  You choose and 
area with your mouse.  Then the bombing units you assign to the area 
will keep bombing it.  So if you select and area 5x5 then the bombers 
would keep droping bombs then turn around and bomb the area again.  
If you choose an area that is too big the bombers would bomb 
different portions of it each time they fly by.

6.  Have a rally point.  You click on a unit and then a little flag 
will appear on him.  Then units that are close enough to see it will 
come and regroup around that unit.  Good option when you're killing 
enemy units by ganging up on single units at a time and need to get 
your guys together.

Most of the improvements on the AI are to make the game more 
realistic and fun.  For example, in real life I wouldn't think a 
marine would stay in one spot while is buddy 3 feet from him is being 
shot.  Also if an enemy is too strong most people would run away and 
regroup.  

Maybe you'd want the AI to respond to situations differently for each 
race which goes with their behaviour.  Also you don't want to over do 
the AI they it is the computer doing most of the stuff for you.
