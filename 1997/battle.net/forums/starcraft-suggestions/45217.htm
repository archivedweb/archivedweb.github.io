&#62; Ok, I was just thinking that MAYBE it would be cool, when we make our 
&#62; own briefings, if instead of some scrolling text and background 
&#62; picture we could have the option of displaying the breifing as an 
&#62; .html file, I think this would be very cool, because for those of us 
&#62; that know html or have a halfway decent editors, we could make some 
&#62; really nice looking briefings, that would be MUCH more fitting than 
&#62; some scrolling text (the breifings would be offline, of course, not 
&#62; online or anything). I mean, if you have some really great scenario 
&#62; or campaign, wouldn't you want to have a really great breifing to go 
&#62; along with it?   
&#62; 
&#62; Well, please tell me what you think, and if this would be possible to 
&#62; impliment.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,

     I think this is agreat idea. HTML files are small enogh to be 
good breifings. I just have a point to bring up as well.... HTML 
files don't automatically scroll. How would we get someone to end the 
breifing. If Blizzard could (and I'm sure they can) make the game 
autoscroll the HTML breifing at a speed the map creator wanted, it 
would be good. Oh... Also I just thought of something. It doesn't 
have to be an HTML file. It can just be coded with HTML tags. Well, 
thats all I have to say. Hope I didn't make anybody bored with all 
this.
