<pre>      These are some very good questions.  I have some answers, but I 
hope Blizzard reads this and responds.

    1.  I'm pretty sure the Dropships LAND before they drop the 
people off :) However, they can drop bombs.
    2.  I haven't been to the Blizzard page today, but there could be 
several reasons (not meaning to get anyone's hope up) They could be 
majorly reworking the page, maybe adding to the Starcraft page; they 
could be doing something that is related to the beta test; or, they 
could just be having problems with their server.
    3.  This question I am REALLY curious about.  If the game is 
setup so that you can train a unit, send the building that the unit 
is training in to another location, and have the unit training while 
the building moves across the landscape, then I can see ALOT of 
problems right there (build 5 or 6 barracks, build the strongest unit 
you can in each, and then move the building back in forth across the 
map, until the unit is ready. Then, send the barracks to the enemy 
base, unload the new units, and move the barracks away :) BAD! :P)
     4.  I don't think units can climb cliffs, and I don't think 
units can fall off of cliffs. 
     5.  I would hope so, and I am positive there are.  Doors are 
just so much fun! :)
     6.  Uh, not sure of this one.  HOWEVER, there is a Protoss 
Carrier that, once built, gives you the option to build interceptors 
(fast, light attack ships), which are built right into the bays of 
the carrier; when you tell the carrier to attack something, the bays 
open, and the swarms of interceptors are unleashed.  Then, they can 
come back and refuel/rearm themselves in the carrier.
     7.  Uh, not sure of this one either :) I am tempted to say no, 
but they might all be able to.
     8.  Don't know :P most likely.  The creep might be the only 
place they CAN burrow into.
     9.  If the spaceships have to be rearmed, refueled, etc. I would 
assume there is a building made to suit that purpose.
     10.  I don't know.
     11.  I don't think so.
     12.  Most likely, but altitude and speed of said object might 
play into &#34;hitability&#34;
     13.  I heard about this to.  Not sure of its authenticy


     As you can see, I have been of very little help to you :) But I 
try, heheh

&#62; The questions are
&#62; 
&#62; 1.Do Dropships land or do they just drop the people?(Stupid Question!)
&#62; 
&#62; 2.Why is the Blizzard page down?
&#62; 
&#62; 3.Can SCV's sort of be transported by a building that takes off while 
&#62; they are in it?
&#62; 
&#62; 4.Can you climb cliffs?
&#62; 
&#62; 5.Are there doors that you have to open in the installation levels.
&#62; 
&#62; 6.I read a long time ago that there was a protoss ship that could 
&#62; temporarily transport a number of units somewhere is that still in 
&#62; the game?
&#62; 
&#62; 7.Can all zergs burrow and how fast?
&#62; 
&#62; 8.Can they burrow in the creep?
&#62; 
&#62; 9.Can you reload the terran wraith's bombs at the dry docks?
&#62; 
&#62; 10.Are the dry docks for repairing and upgrading terran ships?
&#62; 
&#62; 11.Can protoss or zerg get on a terran ship?
&#62; 
&#62; 12.Can the marines hit flying objects?
&#62; 
&#62; 13.I heard about a transport ratio where a dropship can carry a 
&#62; maximum of 2 big units, or 4 medium sized units, or 8 small units. Is 
&#62; it true?
&#62; 
&#62; That is all thank you!
&#62; 
&#62; 			Cowstalker	&#34;Ah yes indeed it is fun time!!&#34;</pre>
