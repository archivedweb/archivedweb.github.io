<pre>&#62;  Those were -suggestions- for LOTC.  Re-read it.





Ok, I will. 



&#62;1. Bridges.  Wouldn't bridges rock?  Think about it, they would 
have 

&#62;to be able to be built by peons, and destrutable by 

&#62;(ships/birds/catapults) dunno.



Perhaps there might be some part in the game where you would have to 
build a bridge in order to advance to another part of the game.  But 
I don't recall seeing any peons. Maybe you could count Thrall as a 
peon in the start of the game. And anyway you don't just go around 
building and destroying stuff all the time. 



&#62;2. Be able to transfer .puds in the chat screen.  How many times 
have 

&#62;you been connected modem or whatever, and you wanted to play 
someone 

&#62;but you get that damn error: &#34;bla bla doesn't have that 
pud&#34;  

&#62;Puds are really small, and could be xfered easily.  Don't need 

&#62;sophisticated protocols to accomplish this.



Lord of the Clans  does NOT have .puds, or anything equivalent to 
.puds. It does not have a chat screen either. It does not connect by 
modem. It is not a multiplayer game, can not and should not and will 
not be a multiplayer Internet game.



I stand by my position that you have no idea what game you're talking 
about. I though you'd go and research up on LOC some more after 
reading my response but obviousliy you did not.



I will now say this ten times in all caps:



WARCRAFT ADVENTURES LORD OF THE CLANS IS NOT A REAL TIME STRATEGY 
GAME LIKE WARCRAFT 2.

WARCRAFT ADVENTURES LORD OF THE CLANS IS NOT A REAL TIME STRATEGY 
GAME LIKE WARCRAFT 2.



It is an ADVENTURE GAME. Haven't you played any King's Quest game? 
That is what Lord Of The Clans is. It has cartoon characters who move 
on painted background sets. You talk to people and find objects to 
put in your inventory and walk from screen to screen trying to solve 
a puzzle.  



And I must now also say ten times in all caps:



WARCRAFT ADVENTURES LORD OF THE CLANS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS 
WARCRAFT 3.

WARCRAFT ADVENTURES LORD OF THE CLANS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS

Warcraft 3 IS a real-time strategy game that will be coming out some 
day but has not even been started yet. Its gameplay is based on 
Warcraft 2 and StarCraft and its storyline continues from that of the 
Lord Of The Clans adventure game.</pre>
