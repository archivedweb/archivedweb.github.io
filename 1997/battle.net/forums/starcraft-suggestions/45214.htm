<pre>Lion,

Thanks for the clarifications (as I mentioned earlier, I'm pretty 
thick from the neck up :)

Yes, memory positions will be featured in Starcraft.  If you have a 
unit, group of units, or even buildings selected, you can hold down 
the CTRL key and hit a number.  Later in the game, you can then hit 
the number you chose to select the units you chose.

There will be a good deal of interaction in the installation 
missions, though I'll see what I can find out about the details you 
had questions about.

There will be 3 basic map types in Starcraft (installation, planet, 
and space), and each basic type will have its own tile sets.  You'll 
have to wait, however, to find out just how many tile sets each map 
type will have :)

Regards,
Pat N.

&#62; You (Pat N) said that you didnt fully understand the questions in my 
&#62; earlier post so ill clarify:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.When i mean memory positions i mean like in RA when you select a 
&#62; unit and press Crtl and (for instance) 1 and a little number number 
&#62; (1 in this case) appears on the left bottom of his selection. You go 
&#62; on playing and later when you need to selesct the aforementioned unit 
&#62; you just press &#34;1&#34;. Will this or something similar be 
&#62; possible in the game?
&#62; 
&#62; 2.I read somewhere that in the installation missions you would not be 
&#62; able to build any units and that the game would be more ofa rpg in 
&#62; those missions, and that you could talk (have conversations) with 
&#62; anyone you meet there. Is this true and will there be installation 
&#62; missions in Zerg and Protoss buildings too?
&#62; 
&#62; 3. Oh and i was just wondering, just how many different terrains will 
&#62; there be?
