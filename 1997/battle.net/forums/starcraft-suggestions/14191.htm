&#62; &#62; If you ask me(flaming opertunity, SOMMS), I would much rather be able 
&#62; &#62; to group an unlimited number of units(Red Alert) then grouping a

&#62; &#62; stats and stuff for my War2 units!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; I, being a die hard Red Alert and Command and Conquer player agree 
&#62; and disagree with your reasonings for not allowing unlimited
&#62; units to be selected. So I'm going to share some of my RA and C&C 
&#62; experiences long with some W2 experieces. My first remark is anybody 
&#62; who ONLY uses the swarm tactic as a strategy is a fool. If the other 
&#62; player knows what he/she is doing, it can be defeated easily. Then, 
&#62; by limiting the ammount of units you can select at once does nothing. 
&#62; For instance, on warcraft 2, if I wanted to swarm a guy, I'll send my 
&#62; slow units off first (9 at a time of course) and then follow up with 
&#62; the faster units a little later so all my guys arrive at the same 
&#62; time. So if you think about, you're not going to stop the swarm 
&#62; tactic. Then what if you need ALL your units to move away froma  spot 
&#62; fast? Say to avoid certain doom?
&#62; 
&#62; Let me give a situation from Commander and Conquer. I had a bunch of 
&#62; Infantry in one spot, then I noticed a bunch if flame tanks moving up 
&#62; on them fast. Infantry HATE fire. So I selected them all at once and 
&#62; away they went to the safety of my base. Well, if I had to move them 
&#62; 9 at a time, at least half would have faced certain doom while i 
&#62; selected nine at a time and moved them where they needed to go. So 
&#62; all we ask is to let us select as many units as we want, it makes 
&#62; things so much easier and so much more fun.
&#62; 

I agreee that limiting the number of units selectable is a lot 
better.   There was one thing that I liked about Red Alert that would 
be a good feature for StarCraft.  There should be the ability to 
group units for more strategic play.  It's a lot easier to press a 
button to select a group of units than having to select each unit you 
want.  You could just have, say group 1 go to one side of the enemy's 
base, and group 2 go to the other side.  That would be a nice 
feature. </pre>
