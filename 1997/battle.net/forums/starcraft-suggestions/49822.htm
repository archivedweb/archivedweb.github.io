&#62; I wonder if Adam used to come in at 4am because he enjoyed it, or 
&#62; because Blizzard wanted him to be here early.  I also wonder where he 
&#62; went and IF he really wanted to leave.  They never told us where he 
&#62; went, just that he had left for a better place and they wished him 
&#62; the best of luck.  Sounds a little fishy to me, I think this story 
&#62; runs deeper than anyone can even imagine.  Think about this ----  
&#62; Maybe Blizzard thought he was giving away to much info to us so they 
&#62; silenced him and told the other reps (Pat and Scott) to tell everyone 
&#62; that he left the company.  Maybe that is why Pat and Scott have not 
&#62; given many hard answers.  They can still here AdamM's watch ticking 
&#62; underneath the floor boards and they know the same fate awaits them 
&#62; if they tell us to much.  :)  I wonder how they got him -- maybe they 
&#62; put something in his coffee, or maybe they just clubbed him from 
&#62; behind as he was diligently typing a response to one of us.  And now, 
&#62; look what keeps happening to Blizzard's site, it keeps crashing for 
&#62; no reason.  Do you think that somehow AdamM's soul has managed to get 
&#62; into the hardware?  Is he trying to get revenge?  Pat, Scott, Adam's 
&#62; story must be heard!  I know you fear for your lives, but the world 
&#62; deserves to know.  I know that this could get you both in great 
&#62; trouble, maybe even land you at the bottom of some lake.  So if you 
&#62; must respond with just the normal cover up I'll understand.  Everyone 
&#62; knows the routine, Blizzard rep says &#34;(He He He) Nice idea, but 
&#62; not true, we are going to delete your post so as not to cause any 
&#62; undue alarm on the forum.&#34;  Then whoever left the post (in this 
&#62; case me) is never heard from again.
&#62; 
&#62; Later
&#62;    The ChipMan
&#62; 
&#62; p.s. very bored.....  Maybe I should get back to work.....
Ok so it's a great theory (funny too) but just in case you were 
really wondering and also just because I don't think the rest of the 
Blizz people deserve the abuse..

AdamM did show up for a post and set everything straight about 
Blizzard. If your curious it's about 33 topics down from this 
one.(not counting responses). I do notice though that it's posted at 
a decent time. 5pM

Roll on little zerg... Roll on.
