&#62; 
&#62;       You have some really good suggestions :)  I agree, each unit 
&#62; should have a bigger reaction zone, and not just stand around if 
&#62; someone near them is battling for their life.  Still, I think that 
&#62; Warcraft 2 did a LOT better job with this then Red Alert.
&#62; 
&#62;   The one about the sentry spot could be hard to do at best, create 
&#62; lots of lag in multi at worst.  If the computer had to scan each unit 
&#62; against another unit, determine which is stronger, and then act, that 
&#62; would surely make the computer skip some beats, and lag the game.
&#62; 
&#62;    I think patrol for flying units is a good idea, since the whole 
&#62; idea of Starcraft is space travel.  This would have been an easy 
&#62; option for Warcraft II, because none of the flying units (zeppelin, 
&#62; dragon, gnomish flying machine, and gryphon rider) consumed fuel 
&#62; while in the air, and they never had to come down.  Starcraft, on the 
&#62; other hand, will probably have some set air time (1 minute for 
&#62; destroyers, 30 seconds for scouts, etc.), and then the craft would 
&#62; have to land and refuel.  This could cause some problems for 
&#62; patrolling:  If the patrol route is too long it would crash, if it 
&#62; goes mindlessly through an enemy base it would crash, and also  (if 
&#62; Blizzard decides to include mid-air collisions, and I hope they 
&#62; do[can you say &#34;kamikaze?&#34;]) then there is the possibility of 
&#62; running into one of your own planes on the same patrol route! Still, 
&#62; I am sure Blizzard could fix these mostly minor problems.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;   Unit AI being smart enough to seek medical aid if needed is one of 
&#62; the points that Dark Reign makes.  But, Dark Reign took it one step 
&#62; farther, letting you manually control the attitudes (testosterone or 
&#62; fuel injected, makes no difference :) ) of your troops, by giving you 
&#62; two slider bars, labeled &#34;Tenacity&#34; and &#34;Autonomy.&#34;  
&#62; I think Tenacity has to do with the gun-ho troops, and if it is used, 
&#62; your troops will wade into the frey, and won't stop until every enemy 
&#62; (or himself) is killed.  Autonomy is the gentler side, and with this 
&#62; set, a unit will actively seek out a medic, and once healed, go back 
&#62; into battle.  Both seem cool, and Blizzard would score major points 
&#62; for having something like it.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;    A bombing zone option would be pretty cool, but could cause some 
&#62; problems:  It might behave like the peon in War2, walking straight 
&#62; through an enemy camp to get gold (translation:  flying straight 
&#62; through one enemies camp just to drop one bomb on another's fort.)  
&#62; Also, it could turn out to be as useless as the parabombs in Red 
&#62; Alert:  A large cargo plane, very weak and very very slow, would inch 
&#62; towards its target (or so they said, the parabombs, weak though they 
&#62; were, seemed to hit everthing but the one silo you clicked on :) ), 
&#62; and then drop 5 parachute bombs.  THAT only happened if you were 
&#62; lucky enough to keep the stupid plane alive, and the bombs were the 
&#62; most pathetic weapons I have ever seen.....
&#62; 
&#62;    The rally point idea is really cool.  Maybe you had a maximum of 5 
&#62; (you could configure the number) flags (each bareing your team 
&#62; color/insignia).  You could set one of these flags down in any area 
&#62; which you had already explored.  Then, if you ever wanted to send 
&#62; troops to that area, you just selected the men, and hit the number 
&#62; that corresponds to that flag. (for example:  You have one already 
&#62; established base, and then set out to build another.  When your 
&#62; second base is well on its way, you decide to put a rally flag there. 
&#62;  Soon after that, one of your scout ships discovers the enemies 
&#62; largest base.  You put another rally flag down.  You have plenty of 
&#62; resources, and are now focusing on troop training.  All goes well, 
&#62; until you hear those tell-tale screams of &#34;we're under attack!  
&#62; They're destroying our city! I can't feel my legs!  I can't feel his 
&#62; legs either! Whatever :) &#34;  So, you immediately select a group of 
&#62; goliaths, and hit the number '1'.  The goliaths charge towards the 
&#62; second base.  Then, deciding that the time is now,you select a group 
&#62; of marines, goliaths, destroyers, etc., and hit the number '2'.  They 
&#62; all storm towards the enemies base.)  Cool!
&#62; 
&#62;    Another idea I have, taken from the rally flag idea, is this:  
&#62; Instead of the flags being like waypoints, they could be like 
&#62; security systems:  You have a maximum number of flags.  Each flag you 
&#62; put down emits a 10x10 (or whatever you choose, mayber it could be 
&#62; upgradable to be bigger) square of purple light, only visible by you. 
&#62;  Each flag is labeled with a number (1 through the maximum number.) 
&#62; If any enemy steps within the square, every troop that is supposed to 
&#62; 'guard' that area runs for the flag, and engages the enemy.  This 
&#62; sounds kind of vague, so how about another example! OH BOY!! ::::
&#62; 
&#62;   Your base is situated in a very large valley, with huge mountains 
&#62; enveloping you.  There is just one way to get into your encampment, 
&#62; and that is through an opening between two mountains.  You want to 
&#62; keep your area secure, so you plant a rally flag in the opening.  The 
&#62; flag has a brightly labeled (maybe neon paint or something?) # 1 (or 
&#62; whatever number) on it.  You select the troops you want to guard the 
&#62; opening, and then, with ALL THE GUARD TROOPS SELECTED, you hit the 
&#62; number 1.  Each troop now has a small one somewhere in their picture, 
&#62; or stats or something.  NOW, whenever an enemy enters the flag area, 
&#62; the troops labeled ONE will engage them.  How 'bout it? Pretty cool, 
&#62; eh? haha :)

&#62; &#62; Please make the AI better than Warcraft2 and Red Alert.  Here are 
&#62; &#62; some things that I didn't like about the Warcraft2 AI, and how to 
&#62; &#62; change it.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1.  Guys wouldn't run to a battle to help out if the unit didn't get 
&#62; &#62; attacked.  You should make the units automatically attack enemy units 
&#62; &#62; that are a certain distance from your buildings.  Or if there is a 
&#62; &#62; big 
&#62; &#62; battle and the unit is close enough it should head for the battle.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2.  Have something like a &#34;sentry spot.&#34;  What this would do 
&#62; &#62; is if a unit saw an enemy unit it would move close to it and attack, 
&#62; &#62; but if the enemy is stronger the unit on sentry would run back to the 
&#62; &#62; spot you selected.  This would be good for drawing enemy units to 
&#62; &#62; places more heavily defended than others.  Also if you have enough 
&#62; &#62; units on sentry they might kill the attackers before they set 
&#62; &#62; foot(tail) in your city.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3.  Patrol was a good option, but this time let all of the flying 
&#62; &#62; units have it.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 4.  If a unit is damaged and is close enough to a repair unit or 
&#62; &#62; building, it will go get itself repaired(unless it is in the middle 
&#62; &#62; of a battle).
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 5.  I like the idea of something like a bombing zone.  You choose and 
&#62; &#62; area with your mouse.  Then the bombing units you assign to the area 
&#62; &#62; will keep bombing it.  So if you select and area 5x5 then the bombers 
&#62; &#62; would keep droping bombs then turn around and bomb the area again.  
&#62; &#62; If you choose an area that is too big the bombers would bomb 
&#62; &#62; different portions of it each time they fly by.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 6.  Have a rally point.  You click on a unit and then a little flag 
&#62; &#62; will appear on him.  Then units that are close enough to see it will 
&#62; &#62; come and regroup around that unit.  Good option when you're killing 
&#62; &#62; enemy units by ganging up on single units at a time and need to get 
&#62; &#62; your guys together.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Most of the improvements on the AI are to make the game more 
&#62; &#62; realistic and fun.  For example, in real life I wouldn't think a 
&#62; &#62; marine would stay in one spot while is buddy 3 feet from him is being 
&#62; &#62; shot.  Also if an enemy is too strong most people would run away and 
&#62; &#62; regroup.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Maybe you'd want the AI to respond to situations differently for each 
&#62; &#62; race which goes with their behaviour.  Also you don't want to over do 
&#62; &#62; the AI they it is the computer doing most of the stuff for you.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; <a href="http://www.ica.net/pages/wave/firebrand">http://www.ica.net/pages/wave/firebrand</a>

Firebrand,  you have some really good ideas, I am in total agreement 
with you on improving AI, just dont make it so that your soldiers are 
fighting the whole war without any commands from you!  : )     The 
rally unit/point and bombing zone were both good too.

Ugly,  I like that idea about the flag that transmits a signal, but 
you could take it one step farther.  You could also make it so that 
you could have units attack that 10x10 area, say for instance (woo 
hoo! another example!) the enemy has a big buttload of towers (SC 
equvalent of course), walls, and archers.  Put  flag #1 on one of the 
towers, then bring in the heavy artillary.  Tell the artillary to 
&#34;shell&#34; flag #1.  The artillary will then try to do maximum 
damage.  This means that they might not necissarily take out the 
tower you have the flag on, but will try to make it so that their 
blast hits as many units as possible in that 10x10 area.  
Another example (I love 'em).  Say there 2 stretches of land in a map 
that either player MUST cross to get to the other's base.  Put flag 
#1 in one stretch, flag #2 in the other.  Select 5 bombers as squad 
1.  Repeat, and name this squad, squad #2.  Tell squad one to keep 
bombing (shelling) the area contained around flag 1, and keep coming 
back for more ammo.  Repeat with Squad 2, telling them to bomb flag 
#2.  I know this is kind of like the bombing zone idea, but a little 
more practical using the flags.  Please tell me what you think

that is the address for the dreadnought homepage, the fleet I belong 
to, we have close to 50 members, come check us out, it wont take more 
than 10-15 minutes of your time.  If you are not in a squad yet, I 
would recommend joining this one.</pre>
