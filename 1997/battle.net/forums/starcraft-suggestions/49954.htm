<pre>      No offense, but you are WAY to Command and Conquer minded.  One 
of the major problems I had with C&C was the fact that they DID use a 
sidebar, instead of clicking on the building.  In C&C, you could only 
construct ONE SINGLE UNIT, even if you had 7 or 8 barracks.  In War2, 
every barrack you had could produce A UNIT SIMULTANEOUSLY and they 
DIDN'T ALL HAVE TO BE THE SAME UNIT.  I would MUCH MUCH MUCH rather 
have the ability to choose what unit each of my barracks could 
produce and do this by hand then try to click on the sidebar and 
search around to discover what random barracks produced my unit.  You 
had to have a special command to choose which building the unit came 
out of just to make it manageable! Ridiculous.  No offense, again :P  
And War2s way was much more realistic (if you ignore the fact that 
you were pumpin' out ogres and dragons :).  What does the amount of 
barracks you have add to the speed in which the unit was produced?!?! 
 Did each barrack produce one part, and then they all come together? 
Barracks A has the left arm, Barracks B has the head, Barracks C has 
the chest.... ridiculous, again. 



          I've ranted and raved enough


                                                   Ugly the Cute

&#62; Will it be necesary to have to build units from within buildings? I 
&#62; mean, like in warcrazft, u went into the barrakcs and did it, but in 
&#62; C&C you just hit the side bar. I myself think it's easier to use a 
&#62; sidebar. Also, if you have more buildings, will the unit the building
