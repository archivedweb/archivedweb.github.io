<pre> While I know that the whole &#34;starship troopers&#34; issue has 
been beaten to death.
I'd like to mention yet another cultural object that starcraft bears 
an odd similarity
towards. I realize that this is because they are common ideas 
nowadays, and that
these games are just representative of those ideas, but I wanted to 
point it out 
anyway (I'm bored, so sue me). The game I'm speaking about (You have 
guessed
it haven't you) is Warhammer 40K. It's a turn based miniatures war 
game, Space
Hulk the computer game was based on Space Hulk the miniatures game 
which was
based on Warhammer 40K. Here are my comparisons between the games.

Terrans + Space Marines. 
        Look similar. This is my weakest comparison. Mainly because 
humans exist in
all our sci fi and so it's not spectacular that they are in both 
games.

Prottos + Eldar.
        With helmets on the Eldar body shape is VERY similar to 
Prottos, conical hairless
heads. Thin. Advanced technology, superior mental powers. Both 
relatively full of
themselves. But the Eldar appear to be far more milatiristic. I will 
also add that in
both cases the military caste is concerned primarily about religion. 
Except the eldar
worship Kaela Mensha Khain, the bloody handed god of war. (wheee!)

Zerg + Tyranids (Genestealers from spacehulk are part of the tyranids 
race)
         Organic bio weapons, both coming from a part of the universe 
unpopulated
by humans. Both convert the land they live in to an organic 
playground all for
themselves. Both are thought to be created by artificial means. But 
the tyranids
convert other life into tyranids (genestealers) and appear to be a 
lot more
hive mentalityish. </pre>
