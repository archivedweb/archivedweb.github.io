&#62; &#62; As any TRUE strategist knows,
&#62; &#62;       For defeating an enemy of the same size or somewhat greater, 
&#62; &#62; the trick is to position your forces to which they can attack at full 
&#62; &#62; strength and numbers, while the enemy is forced to deal with a 
&#62; &#62; greater force wherever he chooses to attack or defend.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; How is this strategy accomplished?  Not by simple selections and 
&#62; &#62; movements... It is done with formations and synchronized attack.  
&#62; &#62; Synchronized attacking and formations are very similar in that they 
&#62; &#62; both deal with the individual speed of the units in the situation.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;     This has been the problem with RTSs ever since the beginning. -
&#62; &#62; The RTS engines of today, have not been powerful enough to support 
&#62; &#62; cohesive tactical maneuvers of formations and synchronized action.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Never could you get your tanks to slow down and stay with the 
&#62; &#62; infantry.
&#62; &#62; Never could you get your knights to escort the catapults.
&#62; &#62; Never could your archers march in formation behind footmen.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; AND, In order for a player to have a combined attack, with different 
&#62; &#62; types of units, all attack at the same time, he had to do minute 
&#62; &#62; calculations and all the while, his opponent was growing stronger.
&#62; &#62; When all the combat groups (control 1,2,3, ect..) had been formed, 
&#62; &#62; and everybody was in place, and it was time to &#34;move out&#34;  
&#62; &#62; GUESS WHAT HAPPENED!  They all got mixed with the other combat 
&#62; &#62; groups.... forming the, oh so common, mass of writhing, dying, 
&#62; &#62; unorganized mob of pixelated soldiers.  Pathetic?  I said it... 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Don't talk to me about a &#34;formations&#34; option, 'cause I know 
&#62; &#62; why it won't work.  Just why it didn't work in C&C/RA and why it 
&#62; &#62; won't work in the upcoming MYTH...  Has anyone checked out Bungies 
&#62; &#62; page on Myth? 
&#62; &#62; Get this, it says this above various screen shots....  &#34;Look at 
&#62; &#62; the various formations you will have to master.&#34;  That's a bunch 
&#62; &#62; of crap, because the soldiers in Myth are BITMAPPED...  They are 
&#62; &#62; sprites, therefore having set walking speeds to fit their sprites 
&#62; &#62; graphics. (Anyone want to try and counter this, go ahead 'cause I 
&#62; &#62; have proof)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; CAN anyone tell me how one is to form a useful formation of combined 
&#62; &#62; types with soldiers who can only move at different speeds?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#34;Well, The formations reform when all the units stop.&#34; -I.E. 
&#62; &#62; RA and the upcoming Myth.   
&#62; &#62;    I say, What good is a formation of attack, when it only reforms 
&#62; &#62; when it reaches it's destination?  It's hardly worth the effort.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; So, I implore you Blizzard.  Please support a way point system in 
&#62; &#62; Starcraft that is useful and do not put in a &#34;formations&#34; 
&#62; &#62; option, unless it will actually work.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;   That is a lot of writing!
&#62;   However, although you make many interesting points, I have one 
&#62; thing to say: if you say it CAN'T be accomplished on a computer came, 
&#62; why complain about it?
&#62;   About the only place you will be able to accomplish what you are 
&#62; asking is a real-life situation. Computer RTS's, although new and 
&#62; being improved all the time, are actually still quite young. Admit 
&#62; it. RTS's aren't exactly old-timers yet.
&#62;   I agree. The problem with Warcraft II and C&C was the problem with 
&#62; formations. You couldn't attack an opponent war-parties rear, because 
&#62; the enemy has equal site in all directions, and would charge you. It 
&#62; is hard to make strategies utilizing that concept. I've tried, and 
&#62; failed many a time.
&#62;   I think Blizzard should seriously consider getting the game out 
&#62; (soon, I hope). But, I do hope that if they can add a way-point 
&#62; system, they do. It would really help!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Hive Tyrant (Long live Starleague!!)
&#62; 'We will crush this pathetic sub-species...'

Tyrants right!  The stratigies in RTS's are pathetic.  Simply build 
up a HUGE force, and run in and destroy the enemy.  Im serious, even 
a pack of gretchen could kill 5 terminators due to onefactor in these 
games...  YOU CANT CLICK AS FAST AS THE COMPUTER!!!  Then your entire 
force get strung out depending on the speed that they have...  Try 
the upcomming Warhammer Fantasy battle or Warhammer 40,000 games.  It 
IS turned based, but alot better that the RTS's these days.
