&#62; This if course would be instantly cleared up by looking at the host 
&#62; from whence the post came.  Even you should have been able to figure 
&#62; that out by now Iolaus.  Perhaps I over-estimated you intelligence...
&#62; ******************************************
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
&#62; &#62; Somms has
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; --made Krowa leave the forum
&#62; ****************************
&#62; I would think this would be a plus Iolaus... you two have something 
&#62; going on that the Forum doesn't know about?
&#62; ****************************
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; --stated that Alchemy's mother does sailors for five bucks a pop
&#62; ****************************
&#62; Ok! Ok! I am sorry!  It was 3 bucks.  Can't a person make a mistake?!
&#62; Jeez...
&#62; ****************************
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; --called Drunk Master Chan a motherf***er
&#62; ****************************
&#62; This is wrong actually.  I called him a motherf*cker.  The other two 
&#62; asteriks are silent.
&#62; *****************************
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; --has had his posts vaped several times by Bliz Support and laughed 
&#62; &#62; about it
&#62; *****************************
&#62; This is true somewhat.
&#62; *****************************
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; --insulted many people for no other reason than he doesn't like their 
&#62; &#62; suggestion
&#62; *****************************
&#62; Iolaus--your wrong again.  It really wasn't their suggestions that 
&#62; bugged me inasmuch as their existence.  So far your1 for 5.  That's 
&#62; pretty lousy.  I hope you never play for the Sonics.
&#62; *****************************
&#62; &#62;     
&#62; &#62;   If this is what you want to defend, you're welcome to it. The guy 
&#62; &#62; is an ass, and everyone knows it. People insult him with good reason. 
&#62; &#62; He insults you in his reply and you say &#34;Well put.&#34; You sound 
&#62; &#62; like an Ugly imitator, or at least, somewhat strange.
&#62; ******************************
&#62; Iolaus you have stooped too low.  You are kicking this kid when he is 
&#62; down in front of the whole goddamn forum.  Let me be the bad-@ss--
&#62; your not very good at it.  Why don't you go back to being that smarmy 
&#62; little goody-two-shoes guy I came to know and abuse?  It seemed 
&#62; people liked you more then.  And after all that's all you really care 
&#62; about isn't it?
&#62; *******************************
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Like I said, the guy seems somewhat disturbed. It happens on the 
&#62; &#62; Internet. At the least, he is very immature, his actions prove it. He 
&#62; &#62; has never apologized for his lame crap, unless you count a weak one 
&#62; &#62; to Alchemy after he totally crossed the line. 
&#62; *******************************
&#62; That wasn't an apology.  I actually felt sorry for the guy.  I mean 
&#62; really..sheep AND sailors?  That's and awful thing for Alchemy to 
&#62; find out about his mother...
&#62; ******************************
&#62; 
&#62; He's nice for ONE post 
&#62; &#62; and you want to make nicey nice with him? I dunno Ugly, I think his 
&#62; &#62; fear of banning is talking. 
&#62; *****************************
&#62; Iolaus get this through your gushy-granola-eating-pot-smoking-animal-
&#62; loving-pie-in-the-sky-every-thing's-hunky-dory-won't-you-be-my-
&#62; neighbor thick skull...
&#62; I don't care if:
&#62;     -Support tries to ban me or not.
&#62;     -People like me or not.
&#62;     -I am forgiven for my cyber-transgressions.
&#62; While these may be life and death matters to you they are not of much 
&#62; concern to me.
&#62; ****************************
&#62; 
&#62; Or maybe you're right, contrary to his 
&#62; &#62; post, he wants to be friendly. Awww, how CUTE Somms. You sensitive 
&#62; &#62; guy, you.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   All I can say, whoever you are, is that Somms has made his own bed. 
&#62; &#62; Just because he is too pathetic to get the clue that no one wants him 
&#62; &#62; around doesn't mean we have to be nice to him. I'll leave him alone 
&#62; &#62; if he stops flaming people for making suggestions. 
&#62; *********************************
&#62; Translation: I am freaking scared of SOMMS and the way he embarrases 
&#62; me in front of everybody all the time and if he wants to quit that's 
&#62; sure fine by me!!!
&#62; Sorry Iolaus this will not happen.
&#62; *********************************
&#62; 
&#62; Blizzard can take 
&#62; &#62; care of his really awful stuff with vapes like they've been doing.
&#62; &#62;    I'll hold my nose and tolerate Somms presence on the forum 
&#62; &#62; because, after all, the guy has no life and isn't going to go 
&#62; &#62; anywhere. 
&#62; ********************************
&#62; That's pretty big-headed talk coming from some loser taking beginning 
&#62; C programming courses from dumpy Foothills Community College 
&#62; nestled in smoggy Los Altos California.  Tell me Ioluas...did 
&#62; Professor Berry flunk you or did you have to do alot of EXTRA-CREDIT 
&#62; to get by? 
&#62; ********************************
&#62; 
&#62; It's kind of sad. Indeed, I think it'll be really cool to 
&#62; &#62; make him into a nice enough guy, which is where he's headed if all 
&#62; &#62; his posts continue to be like the last one.
&#62; *******************************
&#62; Translation:  I hope he'll be my pal 'cause I'm tired of him kickin' 
&#62; my @ss!
&#62; *******************************
&#62; 
&#62;  But he's kind of immature 
&#62; &#62; too, so we'll have to remind him of his attitude problem from time to 
&#62; &#62; time. You know how kids are.  :)
&#62; &#62;  					    __Iolaus__
&#62; 
&#62; *******************
&#62; Beautiful ending Iolaus.  Did you wright that all by yourself or did 
&#62; you have to get Mr. Rogers to fly all the way out to Silicon Valley 
&#62; to help you?.  
&#62; 
&#62;    If you have to pick on Ugly the Cute to help fuel your stupid lame 
&#62; @ss war with me you are a bigger waste of skin than I originally 
&#62; thought you were.  In the future direct your comments at me instead 
&#62; of focusing them at defenseless individuals that may frequent this 
&#62; forum.  This is cowardly and shameful and won't be tolerated.  It 
&#62; really illustrates, Iolaus, how weak you really are.
&#62;                                               --SOMMS



    I enter this forum for the first time in 2 weeks and what do I 
see? An up to date stupidity report made of SOMMS. Interesting....
I started to read this and got to one section that apouled me and I 
quote :
  
 You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
 Somms has

 --made Krowa leave the forum
 ****************************
 I would think this would be a plus Iolaus... you two have something 
 going on that the Forum doesn't know about?

   Why in God's green Earth are you still insulting?!! I have been 
off for so long and apparently you think up suck sick things. I can't 
believe that after all this time you still are bringing me down! A 
plus to what by the way?? I have made a couple suggestions I don't 
recal flaming anyone with the exeption of your juvinile dilinquince. 
You know it comes to a surprise to me that your even here unless you 
enjoy to fight off whole forest fires. From what I can see by Iolaus'
post and your reply that your a a total lonatic and the image I have 
compiled in my head is quite close to this image :

         
      <a href="http://www.fritzz.com/asf/asfcover.jpg">http://www.fritzz.com/asf/asfcover.jpg</a>

  This is as close to the image you made for yourself as I can 
figure. I tried to reason, I woulden't care if you flamed me about 
something stupid that I might have posted but when your first post on 
this forum consisted of 4 words  &#34;Death to Krowa&#34; Then I 
begin to wonder. I see you as a child that has no friends is locked 
up in a room with a computer that can't run a single good game and 
that spends all his/her time on a single forum and the highlight of 
his day if when the 2 posts per 2 hours is lifted so that he may get 
back to trying to get people to his level through insult. I pitty you.
