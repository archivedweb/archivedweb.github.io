&#62; I don't think you have anything to worry about Firebrand.  Game 
&#62; development is usually done by fairly small, tight-knit teams that 
&#62; know a great deal about the product there making.  In other words the 
&#62; team that's sweating LOTC is not necessarily the same group of people 
&#62; beating out SC.  Blizzard currently has about 75 people in their 
&#62; roster.  I would think that with that many people they could easily 
&#62; have 2 or 3 teams developing totally disjoint products.  The only 
&#62; bottle neck might be that these different games are marketed by a 
&#62; single marketing group(probably true).  This, however, would not 
&#62; effect the playability or development of Starcraft.


	Somms,

  Not bad. You actually got through that entire post without calling 
anyone a motherf***er, or implying that their mother services sailors 
for five bucks a pop. Bravo! *clap clap clap*
  Maybe it's the fear of banning talking, but you're actually getting 
civilized.
  Let's see if you're mature enough to keep it up.
