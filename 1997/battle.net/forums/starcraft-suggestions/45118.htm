&#62;    Are you a Computer Science Engineering major?  I was just curious 
&#62; because I am, and I would like to get in touch with some other 
&#62; Computer Science majors besides the ones at my school.  On another 
&#62; note, I was kinda curious about needing to know the Java language, 
&#62; too.  I don't think we do, but I have a feeling that Java is what the 
&#62; future holds, so it wouldn't hurt.  If you want more info. e-mail me; 
&#62; I have a really good book on Java programming.

I am a computer science major with a double minor in math and 
science, maybe another if i get around to it.
From what i understand, with game programming C or C++ is the way to 
go.  And as far as other languages are concerned from what i 
understand, if you know 1 language really well (not just syntax, but 
theory and all that) You are supposed to be able to learn a new 
language in under a week. It is that first language that takes all 
the time, because you are just applying the theory to new syntax 
(have you ever compared C to Pascal? then you would know what i mean)
