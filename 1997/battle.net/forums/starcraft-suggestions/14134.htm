&#62; 
&#62;    Lately I have been away from this forum (because of a server 
&#62; problem and I have gotten back into the game Subspace [if anyone 
&#62; cares, my screen name is ssaamm in subspace, look me up or something, 
&#62; haha]) and when I came back, I was repulsed by what I saw.  After 
&#62; scanning through the messages, I saw one from SOMMS (no, don't hit 
&#62; your back button!  I am not flaming SOMMS :) ) and then a reply from 
&#62; Iolaus.  The bulk of SOMMS message was reassuring Pyran Firebrand 
&#62; that Lord of the Clans won't interfere with Starcraft.  It was a very 
&#62; polite, courteous reply, utilizing no bad language or grammar :)  
&#62; THEN,, I read the reply from Iolaus, and was absolutely MOTIVATED to 
&#62; write this.  Iolaus replied by saying &#34;finally trying to act 
&#62; civilized, eh?  Not cussing or making your-momma jokes, trying to act 
&#62; mature&#34; (NO, this is not completely accurate, but a fair 
&#62; representation :) ) 
&#62;     How PATHETIC!!  You people flaming SOMMS for everything he does 
&#62; are PITIFUL!  The guy is trying to apologize, trying to be civil, and 
&#62; you ASSHOLES are going to go off on him like a bunch of idiots!  
&#62; Everytime SOMMS rights something, someone replies with &#34;SOMMS 
&#62; sucks, or SOMMS is gay, or SOMMS is an asshole (Blizzard will 
&#62; probably vape me for my language, haha)&#34;  And then you have the 
&#62; AUDACITY to call SOMMS IMMATURE?!?!  If you insult him, you think he 
&#62; will keep being friendly, or start being friendly?  He will go back 
&#62; to cussing and fighting like he used to do!  He tries to be friendly, 
&#62; and we just keep insulting him, keep enraging him, and then when he 
&#62; finally blows up we say &#34;SEE? what did i tell you? SOMMS is 
&#62; pathetic.&#34;    Correct me if I'm wrong (can't wait to see the 
&#62; replies for that one!), but we are the pathetic ones.  Kicking him 
&#62; when he's down.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;      That is about all I have to say, I would welcome any criticism 
&#62; or complaints or fights against me, I probably sound like I am 
&#62; whining, too.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;                                                Ugly the Cute



	Ugly (assuming you really ARE Ugly the Cute, and not an imitator)


  You've said you've been away for awhile. Ok, let's catch you up.
Somms has

--made Krowa leave the forum
--stated that Alchemy's mother does sailors for five bucks a pop
--called Drunk Master Chan a motherf***er
--has had his posts vaped several times by Bliz Support and laughed 
about it
--insulted many people for no other reason than he doesn't like their 
suggestion


  If this is what you want to defend, you're welcome to it. The guy 
is an ass, and everyone knows it. People insult him with good reason. 
He insults you in his reply and you say &#34;Well put.&#34; You sound 
like an Ugly imitator, or at least, somewhat strange.

  Like I said, the guy seems somewhat disturbed. It happens on the 
Internet. At the least, he is very immature, his actions prove it. He 
has never apologized for his lame crap, unless you count a weak one 
to Alchemy after he totally crossed the line. He's nice for ONE post 
and you want to make nicey nice with him? I dunno Ugly, I think his 
fear of banning is talking. Or maybe you're right, contrary to his 
post, he wants to be friendly. Awww, how CUTE Somms. You sensitive 
guy, you.

  All I can say, whoever you are, is that Somms has made his own bed. 
Just because he is too pathetic to get the clue that no one wants him 
around doesn't mean we have to be nice to him. I'll leave him alone 
if he stops flaming people for making suggestions. Blizzard can take 
care of his really awful stuff with vapes like they've been doing.
   I'll hold my nose and tolerate Somms presence on the forum 
because, after all, the guy has no life and isn't going to go 
anywhere. It's kind of sad. Indeed, I think it'll be really cool to 
make him into a nice enough guy, which is where he's headed if all 
his posts continue to be like the last one. But he's kind of immature 
too, so we'll have to remind him of his attitude problem from time to 
time. You know how kids are.  :)
