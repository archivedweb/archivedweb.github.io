<pre>I recently bought Dark Reign(for all you flame happy idiots out 
there, I can afford to buy both that and Starcraft, so ha!).  It is a 
good game, with alotta cool features.  But there are also some 
mistakes activision made which I think you should double check on. 
Here goes:

1:  Lookalike units-This is SOoooo annoying. Is it a tank with a 
laser gun, is it a tank with that weird burst fire, etc. Actually, 
with the exception of a few tanks, the mobile machinery wasn't that 
hard to tell apart, but they really screwed upin terms of infantry 
and units.  First off, all the infantry, regardless of which side 
they are, look alike except for very small graphic differences 
gunwise. You are not gonna be able to look that close in a fight.  
The buildings are the worst part though.  You have to first memorize 
what each building is and does, and then rememorize what it looks 
like upgraded.  My advice is to go the same way you did with 
war2:make the purpose and function of each unit obvious, i.e. farms 
had plowed fields, grunts had obvious looking weapons, and the 
alchemists looked..well, like alchemists.  Make the flamethrowers 
standing still animation show fire, have the machine gun guys fire 
off in the air every os often, etc.  Above all, include the sounds 
for buildings when u click on them, as this helps you to get them 
memorized more quickly.

2: Medical/Repair personel-Who's idea was this? Flog that person with 
a wet noodle! I think the idea of infantry like units, without 
weapons, which repaired/healed other units u moved near them started 
with red alert...unfortunately, the dark reign people didn't think 
enough to realize this is a crappy idea.  Moving a medical unit with 
a group, trying to keep it in back, keep it out of fire, move it to 
key healing positions, moving injured units back to it....this isn't 
fun, its a chore.  If you are going to have healing for protoss and 
terrans, make it mass healing, such as a protoss which can create a 
healing field all around it, which affects all units at the same time 
within the field.  Or at least, if you must have a doctor/whatever 
unit(god forbid), make it AUTOMATICALLY run out to heal anything 
within its sight. Clicking the healer, selecting 'heal this unit' 
waiting for it to be done, selecting 'heal this next unit'...don't do 
that.

3 Stupid independence factor:  I agree that the units should fire 
back automatically if an enemy attacks, and maybe even pursue.  But 
if you let them pursue, at least give them some brains.  In dark 
reign, if you are massing a group outside the enemy's base, just 
waiting for your rift creator to take out the enemy's neutron 
accelerators(big BIG tower), your enemy could just have any unit come 
up, take a couple pot shots at your group, and then run back for the 
towers.  No matter what independence you have selected, your 
attackers WILL follow that unit back, and basically get their buts 
kicked by the towers...make sure that in a similar SC condition, the 
units will know the range of the towers/whatever, and act to stay out 
of it unless you say so.  And for heavens sake, include a 'stay put 
no matter what' command like you had in war2.

4:Finally, a word about modems and being connected.  Alotta modems, 
such as mine:(, have a nasty tendency to kick out without letting you 
know every so often.  In windows this isn't a problem, as you can see 
the little modem icon stop flashing its lights.  I'd ask that you 
make  a similar icon, to show that you are still connected, and your 
modem is still at work.  Also, make sure that if the disconnect 
situation does occur, you have a'cancel' button no matter where you 
are.

Well, thats it.  Btw, any new word on how the protoss teleportation 
system works?(I still like the diabloesque portal system 
better...opening a portal between two enemy bases...muahahhaha:)</pre>
