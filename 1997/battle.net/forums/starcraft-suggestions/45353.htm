&#62;               Maybe if they were weak, you could have a small chance 
&#62;               to capture not kill them. Then you might be able to use 
&#62; thier 
&#62;               weapons, or get  information by torture. You could hold 
&#62; them in a small 
&#62;               prison camp.  You could even put up a ranson on very 
&#62; important guys. 
&#62;               This was  awfully hard to do in war. 2. Everytime i 
&#62; tried this i 
&#62;               killed what i   wanted to capture. I think it would 
&#62; really add to the 
&#62;               game if their  were these hostages. Maybe if there was 
&#62; enough of them 
&#62;               in one prison  they could even break out in an angry 
&#62; mob. This really 
&#62;               adds to the  game with hostages I think. It would 
&#62; really tick poeple 
&#62;               off, and  would be fun to do.       Tell me what you 
&#62; think of the 
&#62;               idea! You  hate it? TELL ME! You love it? TELL ME!
&#62; 
&#62;                             THanx for your time, i greatly appretiate 
&#62; it.

&#62; 
&#62;               This is like the third time (SORRY) (SORRY, SORRY) 
&#62; Could somebody  please help me? I want this idea posted when blizzard 
&#62; lookes at the fourm. Like 10 - 12. Around there. Just copy this and 
&#62; paste it around then in one of your messages. THANX


Not a bad idea man, what do you think of the idea of being able to 
trade units and not just resources with allies?  Email me with your 
comments, i only come here every few days.  And could you tell me 
where and when they will do the beta test run?  I would appreciate 
it.  Do you know if they will be ABLE to have live video on it with 
their software and a computer camera?  That would be awesome.</pre>
