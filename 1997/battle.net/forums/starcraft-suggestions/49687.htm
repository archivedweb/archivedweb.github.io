<pre>    1. I sure hope the Dropship lands... If it didn't that would be 
bad for Protoss and Zerg
    2. No idea
    3. Ask someone else
    4. No, you can't climb cliffs
    5. Maybe
    6. The arbeiter can cloak all units around it, I think that's the 
closest you'll get
    7. All Zerg execpt the Ultralisk and (obviously) flyiers can 
burrow underground, but they CAN NOT move while underground
    8. Of course
    9. No idea
    10. Dunno
    11. I should hope not...
    12. No
    13. Yes

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;       These are some very good questions.  I have some answers, but I 
&#62; hope Blizzard reads this and responds.
&#62; 
&#62;     1.  I'm pretty sure the Dropships LAND before they drop the 
&#62; people off :) However, they can drop bombs.
&#62;     2.  I haven't been to the Blizzard page today, but there could be 
&#62; several reasons (not meaning to get anyone's hope up) They could be 
&#62; majorly reworking the page, maybe adding to the Starcraft page; they 
&#62; could be doing something that is related to the beta test; or, they 
&#62; could just be having problems with their server.
&#62;     3.  This question I am REALLY curious about.  If the game is 
&#62; setup so that you can train a unit, send the building that the unit 
&#62; is training in to another location, and have the unit training while 
&#62; the building moves across the landscape, then I can see ALOT of 
&#62; problems right there (build 5 or 6 barracks, build the strongest unit 
&#62; you can in each, and then move the building back in forth across the 
&#62; map, until the unit is ready. Then, send the barracks to the enemy 
&#62; base, unload the new units, and move the barracks away :) BAD! :P)
&#62;      4.  I don't think units can climb cliffs, and I don't think 
&#62; units can fall off of cliffs. 
&#62;      5.  I would hope so, and I am positive there are.  Doors are 
&#62; just so much fun! :)
&#62;      6.  Uh, not sure of this one.  HOWEVER, there is a Protoss 
&#62; Carrier that, once built, gives you the option to build interceptors 
&#62; (fast, light attack ships), which are built right into the bays of 
&#62; the carrier; when you tell the carrier to attack something, the bays 
&#62; open, and the swarms of interceptors are unleashed.  Then, they can 
&#62; come back and refuel/rearm themselves in the carrier.
&#62;      7.  Uh, not sure of this one either :) I am tempted to say no, 
&#62; but they might all be able to.
&#62;      8.  Don't know :P most likely.  The creep might be the only 
&#62; place they CAN burrow into.
&#62;      9.  If the spaceships have to be rearmed, refueled, etc. I would 
&#62; assume there is a building made to suit that purpose.
&#62;      10.  I don't know.
&#62;      11.  I don't think so.
&#62;      12.  Most likely, but altitude and speed of said object might 
&#62; play into &#34;hitability&#34;
&#62;      13.  I heard about this to.  Not sure of its authenticy
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;      As you can see, I have been of very little help to you :) But I 
&#62; try, heheh

&#62; &#62; 1.Do Dropships land or do they just drop the people?(Stupid Question!)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2.Why is the Blizzard page down?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3.Can SCV's sort of be transported by a building that takes off while 
&#62; &#62; they are in it?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 4.Can you climb cliffs?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 5.Are there doors that you have to open in the installation levels.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 6.I read a long time ago that there was a protoss ship that could 
&#62; &#62; temporarily transport a number of units somewhere is that still in 
&#62; &#62; the game?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 7.Can all zergs burrow and how fast?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 8.Can they burrow in the creep?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 9.Can you reload the terran wraith's bombs at the dry docks?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 10.Are the dry docks for repairing and upgrading terran ships?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 11.Can protoss or zerg get on a terran ship?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 12.Can the marines hit flying objects?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 13.I heard about a transport ratio where a dropship can carry a 
&#62; &#62; maximum of 2 big units, or 4 medium sized units, or 8 small units. Is 
&#62; &#62; it true?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; That is all thank you!
&#62; &#62;
