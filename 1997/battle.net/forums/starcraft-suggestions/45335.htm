&#62; Hello all,
&#62; Just wondered what everyones opinions are on the games listed in the 
&#62; subject. I know starcraft isnt out yet but i have to say Total Annihi
&#62; lation kicks but. The thing it has over starcraft is true 3d terrain 
&#62; and new units and maps for free via the web.
&#62; Tell me what you think.
&#62;

I think you have no idea what the stuff you said actually adds
up to. 3d terrain is barely an improvement over fake 3d terrain
as far as the strategies are concerned (small differences in 
elevation mesn just about nothing). Graphically the 3d engine
is still only underneath a 2d tile setup (I think). New units and
maps over the web are going to be almost useless. Already
most of the units are just useless mirrors of each other, any
new units thy make will for the most part be nothing new.
Maps over the web is nothing, people can make their own
maps and distribute them to friends. And from what I've
heard, TA is lacking a little in the balance of the units.
Adding in more units won't help that at all, it will just
overcomplicate things. Dark Reign is really nothing that
spectacular.  Starcraft has the three unique species and
enough terrain elevations to have as much of an impact
as 3d terrain, and it also doesn't have too many units, so it
isn't overcomplicated. AoE is also a good game; it has 
random maps and lots of balances in the units, but it
looks like some things might not work in it as well as one
might hope.  AoE and Starcraft look like the best two RTS
games so far, with TA next and then DR behind them, 
probably back somewhere with war2, which is still a great
game.</pre>
