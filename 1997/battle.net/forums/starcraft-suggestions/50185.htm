&#62; &#62; &#62; Blizzard keeps saying that in oppose to warcraft 2 there will not be 
&#62; &#62; &#62; parallel units in Starcraft (in war2 you had the grunt/footman; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Elf/axethrower Knight/Ogre etc.)
&#62; &#62; &#62; But it seems like it IS the same way.
&#62; &#62; &#62; Protoss have the zealot, terran - Marine and zerg - zergling.
&#62; &#62; &#62; terran have the tank which is parallel to the ultralisk.
&#62; &#62; &#62; Each race has a main air attack unit - Wraith, mutalisk, carrier.
&#62; &#62; &#62; Each race has a flying transport, a building unit, a psy/cloak unit
&#62; &#62; &#62; And so on...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Are you just looking for conflict here or what? How do you expect 
&#62; &#62; them to get around that. Have one race all flying and one race ground 
&#62; &#62; and the last subteranian or something. Each race does have very 
&#62; &#62; unique strengths and weeknesses but if they are going to fight they 
&#62; &#62; have to fight on land and in the air. They are going to have units 
&#62; &#62; that are better than others or 'main' units as you put them.So YeS 
&#62; &#62; each race does have 'main' attackers and defenders, Yes they all have 
&#62; &#62; 'worker' units but they work in different ways.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;  Sorry if I get carried away here. My point is that to make the races 
&#62; &#62; 'absolutely' different you'd have to put them in different games. In 
&#62; &#62; a balanced game there are going to be similarities. I think it's a 
&#62; &#62; safe bet that each race will require a TOTALLY different strategy to 
&#62; &#62; use so in a RTStrategy game what more can we ask for.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; &#62; &#34;Peace-Love-But kill the first off-world that so much as 
&#62; &#62; twitches.&#34;
&#62; What I meant is that in Warcraft 2 there was no difference between 
&#62; orcs and humans (other than how the units looked). I just hope 
&#62; Starcraft will be different :)

   A few examples.
Notice that the psy/cloak units for each race are very different.  A 
few of the Zerg units can burrow.  (No movement while underground)  
The Protoss Arbiter cloaks other units except other Arbiters.  The 
terrans have the ghost and the Wraith(wraith does cloak?) that cloak 
themselves.
The zealot,marine and zergling have different weapon types and 
probably different hp#.
The farms are quite different.  The Zerg's is a transport and can 
spot cloaked enemies, so a few must be close to the front of battle.  
I believe the Protoss and Terran are very similar to WC2 farms.
The tank and the ultralisk not that similar, other than both dealing 
massive damage.  If the ultralisk gets close to the tank, the tank is 
diced.  If the tank can keep the ultralisk at distance, the zerg is 
pulp.
