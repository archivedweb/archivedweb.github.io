<pre>Also, the Protoss system of energy distribution, (buildings need to 
stay near nexus, or pylons)  is VERY similar to the gameplay in 
NetStorm.  It utilized more stationary units, but the concept is 
still the same.

&#62; I'd like to mention yet another cultural object that starcraft bears 
&#62; an odd similarity
&#62; towards. I realize that this is because they are common ideas 
&#62; nowadays, and that
&#62; these games are just representative of those ideas, but I wanted to 
&#62; point it out 
&#62; anyway (I'm bored, so sue me). The game I'm speaking about (You have 
&#62; guessed
&#62; it haven't you) is Warhammer 40K. It's a turn based miniatures war 
&#62; game, Space
&#62; Hulk the computer game was based on Space Hulk the miniatures game 
&#62; which was
&#62; based on Warhammer 40K. Here are my comparisons between the games.
&#62; 
&#62; Terrans + Space Marines. 
&#62;         Look similar. This is my weakest comparison. Mainly because 
&#62; humans exist in
&#62; all our sci fi and so it's not spectacular that they are in both 
&#62; games.
&#62; 
&#62; Prottos + Eldar.
&#62;         With helmets on the Eldar body shape is VERY similar to 
&#62; Prottos, conical hairless
&#62; heads. Thin. Advanced technology, superior mental powers. Both 
&#62; relatively full of
&#62; themselves. But the Eldar appear to be far more milatiristic. I will 
&#62; also add that in
&#62; both cases the military caste is concerned primarily about religion. 
&#62; Except the eldar
&#62; worship Kaela Mensha Khain, the bloody handed god of war. (wheee!)
&#62; 
&#62; Zerg + Tyranids (Genestealers from spacehulk are part of the tyranids 
&#62; race)
&#62;          Organic bio weapons, both coming from a part of the universe 
&#62; unpopulated
&#62; by humans. Both convert the land they live in to an organic 
&#62; playground all for
&#62; themselves. Both are thought to be created by artificial means. But 
&#62; the tyranids
&#62; convert other life into tyranids (genestealers) and appear to be a 
&#62; lot more
&#62; hive mentalityish. </pre>
