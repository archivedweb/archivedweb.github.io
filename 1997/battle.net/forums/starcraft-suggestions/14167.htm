<blockquote>
<pre>As any TRUE strategist knows,
      For defeating an enemy of the same size or somewhat greater, 
the trick is to position your forces to which they can attack at full 
strength and numbers, while the enemy is forced to deal with a 
greater force wherever he chooses to attack or defend.  

How is this strategy accomplished?  Not by simple selections and 
movements... It is done with formations and synchronized attack.  
Synchronized attacking and formations are very similar in that they 
both deal with the individual speed of the units in the situation.

    This has been the problem with RTSs ever since the beginning. -
The RTS engines of today, have not been powerful enough to support 
cohesive tactical maneuvers of formations and synchronized action.  

Never could you get your tanks to slow down and stay with the 
infantry.
Never could you get your knights to escort the catapults.
Never could your archers march in formation behind footmen.

AND, In order for a player to have a combined attack, with different 
types of units, all attack at the same time, he had to do minute 
calculations and all the while, his opponent was growing stronger.
When all the combat groups (control 1,2,3, ect..) had been formed, 
and everybody was in place, and it was time to &#34;move out&#34;  
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED!  They all got mixed with the other combat 
groups.... forming the, oh so common, mass of writhing, dying, 
unorganized mob of pixelated soldiers.  Pathetic?  I said it... 

Don't talk to me about a &#34;formations&#34; option, 'cause I know 
why it won't work.  Just why it didn't work in C&C/RA and why it 
won't work in the upcoming MYTH...  Has anyone checked out Bungies 
page on Myth? 
Get this, it says this above various screen shots....  &#34;Look at 
the various formations you will have to master.&#34;  That's a bunch 
of crap, because the soldiers in Myth are BITMAPPED...  They are 
sprites, therefore having set walking speeds to fit their sprites 
graphics. (Anyone want to try and counter this, go ahead 'cause I 
have proof)

CAN anyone tell me how one is to form a useful formation of combined 
types with soldiers who can only move at different speeds?

&#34;Well, The formations reform when all the units stop.&#34; -I.E. 
RA and the upcoming Myth.   
   I say, What good is a formation of attack, when it only reforms 
when it reaches it's destination?  It's hardly worth the effort.

So, I implore you Blizzard.  Please support a way point system in 
Starcraft that is useful and do not put in a &#34;formations&#34; 
option, unless it will actually work.
