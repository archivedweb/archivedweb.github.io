Win95 sucks because it tries to do ll the work with the system 
itself, which would be nice if it wasn't for the little problem that 
in most cases where it tries to do anything, it fails misserably.
Like when I installed my network card.
First, it found it, and started installing, yeah, PnP is nice.
But when it was done, and i restarted the comp, the mouse wasnt 
working, cause Win95 wasnt smart enought to realize(ok I know 
computers arent smart, as in high IQ, but if you have a decently high 
IQ, u know what I mean:-) that both the com-port and the lan-card 
can't run on the IRQ.
No problemo, changed to a free IRQ, the mouse worked, but the card 
still didnt work.
So then I saw the drivers were all messed up, some drivers were 
missing, some were wrong, and some misconfigured.
So, i cleaned up this mess, and manually installed the right drivers, 
and restarted.
Worked fine now.
But if I would have done it all by myself from the beginning(like in 
Dos) it would have saved me like 30 mins of work.
That's why Dos is way better than win95, u do everything(well, ok, 
not the really advanced stuff, but installing drivers and stuff like 
that) yourself, and if u know how to do, it will allways be done 
right, unlike when win95 does it.
Besides, Dos is WAY faster than win95.

Ps
Alot of a's and r's might be missing, but that's cause my keyb is 
about 6 years old :)</pre>
