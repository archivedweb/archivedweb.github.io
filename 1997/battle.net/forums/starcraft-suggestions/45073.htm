<pre>       This is like the 3rd time Iv'e posted questions and got no 
answer. So Please Answer.
                  Ok say you have some of the same units that have a 
special attack like death and decay etc... can they do it all at the 
same time if you had like 9 of them or two of them. Another thing is 
maybe say you have like 3 of one type unit 4 of another and 5 of 
another can you select all of them and say they all had special 
attacks like lust,runes,D&K you would be able to use each attack by 
click on icon and then that group could do that specific attack but 
you would still have the others selected and they could do their 
special attack?
                   Say when your zurg are burrowed underground and an 
enemy unit walks over the land where they are or near where they are 
can he see them. And if so will they have the same eye site of the 
ground above if they were standing on the same spot above ground as 
they are when they are burrowed into the ground?
                   If your work units in starcraft such as peons in 
war2 if they get attacked while mining resources will they run fight 
back or what?
                   Also say you give a goliath an order to move to 
such and such a spot and he gets attacked on the way will he fight 
back or just keep going?
                   The last question is when a zurg captures a SVC 
unit and can then make terran buildings and units will the units you 
make be able to burrow like the regular zurg units can?

                            Thanks for ya time</pre>
