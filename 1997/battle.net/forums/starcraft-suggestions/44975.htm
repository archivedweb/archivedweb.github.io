<pre>   FROM: Suk on Taks (well, Ok, maybe it's Iolaus... ;)  
     TO: All you Puny Forumers, worshipping a rip-off game...

   I would just like to say, that Starcraft is definitely a RIP-OFF 
of EVERYTHING in the KNOWN UNIVERSE!!! The conspiracy goes WAAAAY 
beyond 'Starship Troopers' and 'Warhammer 40K'... I mean, I 
mean...TERRANS, Ok, TERRANS comes from the word 'Terra', which means 
'Earth', and what planet are we living on people?!? You just THINK 
about it, you'll see what I mean...and, oh yeah, PROTOSS, that's just 
SO original...I mean, like we don't ALL watch NFL FOOTBALL GAMES five 
months a year...you see Brett Favre or Aikman or Young drop back to 
pass, and he's a Professional football player who's what, What, WHAT 
(I can't hear u!!!)-- he's TOSSING THE BALL! So pro + toss= PROTOSS! 
I mean, Bliz, just give it up, you un-original twits!

  AND yep, the ZERG, they STOLE THE ZERG TOO! I mean, we ALL saw 'Toy 
Story', and like, they used the word 'Zurg' and even though we never 
SAW a Zerg in Toy Story or even got told WHAT they were, well, all-
righty then, you know, YOU JUST KNOW that Pixar and Steve Jobs had a 
concept in MIND for them, just in CASE, and that Blizzard's 
TELEPATHIC SPIES read Jobs' mind and STOLE ALL OF TOY STORY'S IDEAS 
FOR THE ZERG!!!!!! (sad sad sad... I am so ashamed of you Blizzard)...

  And oh yeah, Starcraft being a COMPUTER GAME! Yeah, like DOOM 
wasn't a COMPUTER GAME, or QUAKE, or SPACE INVADERS.. and it comes on 
a CD-ROM...how MANY COMPANIES have you stolen THAT idea from, 
Blizzard! You just SUCK! And it's for Win95 and Macintosh, tell me 
THAT'S original, why can't you come up with a BRAND-NEW OS to port it 
to, can u answer that, no, didn't think so, and my GOD, you REALLY 
think OTHER COMPANIES didn't have WEBSITES before Blizzard, well, 
that's just too low, stealing that idea too... and...and.. also and 
furthermore....

    *BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!* (Su Tak's head explodes from the 
outrage and unfairness of it all.....)

  Later that evening...

Iolaus: No officer, I have NO idea how it happened...he said he was 
just going to post something on the Suggestions Forum, and 10 minutes 
later I go in there and there's brains all over the walls...


    &#34;All great thinkers stand on the shoulders of those who've 
come before...&#34;
                      __Iolaus__
