&#62; &#62; Warcraft was one of the worst games i have ever played.  The sound

&#62; &#62; If starcraft has sound like war2, i won't buy it.  Don't give me crap 
&#62; &#62; about missing out on a really cool game, cuz in my humble opinion 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard doesn't know a thing about making a good game... Take 
&#62; &#62; Diablo, after an hour it was boring, i mean, there was nothing too it.
&#62; &#62; Click, click, click and click again.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Another thing about Starcrap... What kinda game has no release date?  
&#62; &#62; I know Blizzard is a new company, and that they are still learning 
&#62; &#62; their way around, but no release date?  gimme a break...
&#62; &#62; Blizz is trying to avoid having gamers gripe about a missed release 
&#62; &#62; date, so they just don't have one...  so, in trying to avoid one prob 
&#62; &#62; they now have another.  Instead of ppl complaining about a missed 
&#62; &#62; release date they have ppl complaining cuz there is no release date.

Well, apparently, many people think blizzard DOES know how to make a 
good game, considering how many copies their games have sold. 
Blizzard isn't setting a realease date because they aren't sure when 
all of the features that they want will be implemented. I think 
having no realease date is better than having a release date that 
will just be pushed back.</pre>
