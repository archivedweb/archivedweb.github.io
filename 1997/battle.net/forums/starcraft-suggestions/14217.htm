&#62; This was in my other message but a race editor would really be great! 
&#62; Think of it. Players could make their own races by drawing sprites 
&#62; and makeing their weaknesses and strengths and then players could 
&#62; draw their own buildings!! It would add many many many more hours of 
&#62; re-playablility.  To speed up multiplayer game play you would have to 
&#62; have the same &#34;race set&#34; on both computers. Then people could 
&#62; give out races and try to make stronger ones.
&#62; 
&#62; Please Blizzard, I don't care how &#34;choppy&#34; the editor for 
&#62; that is, heck, I'll even do it with ResEdit (I have a mac) , unlike 
&#62; Warcraft where the sprites are uneditable in ResEdit.  Please, it 
&#62; would be soooooo cool!

	This idea is great, but unrealistic.  This will probably not be an 
option for ANY RTS for a very long time because it would either 
require true physics (you drawing a few views of a sprite, the 
computer manipulating it), or hours upon hours spent at the computer 
drawing picts.  
	Even in a game like Escape Velocity, where each ship needed only the 
picts for a 180 rotation, not to mention all the specs, it could take 
hours with a paint program and RESedit to create a decent ship.  
That's one ship.  In a game like starcraft, you would need to program 
the picts for a figure for all viewpoints and then all the picts for 
movement and attacking, for all viewpoints.  Then you would have to 
program the specs.  You would need to do all this for every unit, and 
for every builings.  Even if you did do all this, I doubt your new 
race would be any good.  It takes weeks of testing by professionals 
to ensure balance between the races, I doubt any of us could do it in 
months.
	Again, this is a great idea, however fantastic.  There could be, 
however, simple ways to edit the races, like replacing the sprites or 
adding units to existing races, but that falls short of creating a 
new race.
	From a players standpoint, I really hope the geniuses at Blizzard 
could make this work, this would not only make Starcraft the best 
game ever now, but for as long as people keep adding to it.  Maybe 
their could be a plug-in capability, like in EV, to change things 
like the races.  Even if we can't, maybe other developers with 
experience and resources could release plug-ins that would add more 
races and PUD's.  These would be relatively cheap, and much like 
buying a normally $60 sequel for under $30.</pre>
