&#62;   As you are the overall best Idea-man on the forum, if you could add 
&#62; your list of the very best Suggestions you've seen, that would be 
&#62; cool (include the building-chewer and the frog-tongue on Zerg organic 
&#62; starships among them!)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 					--Herc's scene-stealin' friend,
&#62; 						Iolaus

I'd be happy to. 

There is a slight problem, however... The entire list is now too long 
to fit in one post!   Well, here are my favorite few...


--------It's a repost (again) --------------
Zerg Suggestions:

How about a Zerg unit with a long frog-like toungue? Some big 
nightmare that gobbles up marauders and templars in the middle of 
combat. You could also apply this to a spacecraft, with a big Zerg 
ship snacking on little interceptors.

I had an idea for a slightly strange Zerg unit. It's a kind of beetle-
thing that slowly scampers towards enemy buildings and chews away at 
them, doing damage at a very slow rate. Now, the unit itself has 
extreme armour. It can take a pounding from several units for a while 
before going down. It's offset by the fact it can't hurt enemy units, 
and it's slow. But it would still be useful for the Zerg when 
attacking an enemy base. 
Just think, you mix two or three of these guys in an attack. The 
enemy can ignore them (And wind up with damaged buildings), or attack 
them (And get cut to pieces by other units while trying to hurt them).
They would be sort of like slow-motion sappers, really.

Actually, I just had an amusing thought about the beetle-termite 
thing. Imagine a terran building sees one coming, dumps it's add-ons 
and moves away...
A low speed chase! The building ponderously chugs along with the unit 
scuttling along after it, slowly gaining...
Possibly once one of these things actually manages to sink their 
nasty little mandibles into a building they should hold it in place, 
as well as damaging it.

Zerg with electrical discharge ability similar to an electric eel. 
Units nearby would take damage. You could give some Zerg spacecraft  
the ability to blast opponents with lightning similar to the tesla 
towers in RA.

The Zerg should have lethal attack units that look like harmless 
critters.

One idea for a Zerg close combat assault unit is some kind of beastie 
who's primary advantage is that he/she/it heals very fast. So fast 
that weak enemies cannot damage it fast enough to actually hurt it. 
It could only be effectively fought by numerous or powerful units. If 
it was melee-only it wouldn't be too powerful, but it would be great 
for picking off enemy scouts and for hit and run raids.

Zerg should eat enemy corpses, and possibly critters. Just for fun. 
They should laugh cruely after they do it, too.

Instead of walls, the Zerg could have a fast-growing plant stuff. It 
could be used defensively, or possibly even to choke up an enemy 
base, disrupting unit deployment and resource gathering.
Hmm, that would be really, really annoying!

How about the Zerg with a sonic weapon. Have some Zerg with a 
reverberation chamber in the head, and -yum- liquified human (or 
Protoss) flesh. Great against lightly armoured units, but not too 
good against the heavy stuff. Unless it had ceramic armour.

The Zerg could have more senses than we humans. In addition to a 
functional sense of smell (Tracking abilities?) they could have sonar 
(like bats) or organic radar, or any number of things.

Some Zerg should be able to swim! Since they aren't wearing the heavy 
mechanised armour, the Zerg could take a quick dip to cross streams, 
escape hostiles, etc.

How about ramships? Slam into an enemy ship, eat the crew and take it 
over. That would be good to compensate for the Zerg's (possible) 
disadvantages in ranged weapons. The captured ships would probably 
have reduced efficiency to reflect the battle damage and untrained 
crew.

What about proper flyers? (Ones with wings) No use in space, but in 
an atmosphere the could fly circles around the less manouverable 
spaceships.

Zerg parasite units that draw off enemy power plants, shield 
generators, or whatever.


Protoss psychic abilities:
1) Partially 'Blind' a unit. Reduce it's sight radius to a tiny 
circle (like around a recently killed corpse in war2). This would be 
excellent for knocking out enemy scouts, confusing large attacks and 
so on, but it's not actually very powerful. An ability that is 
useful, rather than powerful.

2) Psychic transference. 'Re-charge' another unit's psychic 
abilities. I always thought this would have been a useful ability for 
paladins in War2, they could escort a mage and re-charge him after 
combat . It would not be 100&#37; efficient, obviously. It also 
assumes different units have different powers.
I was thinking it could be used to re-charge units of a different 
type: For example a templar transfers 100 psi-points to give an 
archon 50, so the archon can use it's powers. (which would be better 
than the templar's.)
I thought it might be a good thing to put in so simple psi-units will 
still be useful later in the game.
It means that groups of templars would lend support to the powerful 
psi-units, rather than just having 2 or 3 of the of the more advanced 
units. I just like anything to ensure units don't become useless.

3) See another unit's area. Use this on an enemy unit and you see 
what it sees. Useful if you use it on the first troop in a big group, 
even better if you use it on an enemy scout that's moving around a 
lot.
The 'see another unit's area' would have a fairly long range, and it 
would last a very long time. Once it has been used on an enemy unit, 
it reveals the map to you exactly as if it was your unit (regardless 
of how far your psi-unit is).
So you catch an enemy peon-type unit away from base, use this on him 
and -bingo-, your enemy will map out his entire base for you, as the 
peon wanders around doing peon-things.
It would mean the protoss could have 'hit and run' scouts. Do one 
flyby of an enemy base, and you can cast this on a unit or two and 
know what is going on for a while


Why not have critters that are useful in some way? Fire off a few 
rounds near a herd and and get a stampede into a group of enemy 
units. Scare a critter into an enemy base to check out the automated 
defences. That kind of thing.


Blizz, regarding the battle.net ranking. Make sure you can turn it 
off! Sometimes I just want to play for fun, and games that keep track 
of wins/losses tend to mean you have to be more carefull all the 
time, because a few losses can really blow your ratio.

Some long-range artillery or rocket launcher units should have a 
firing range greater than their sight range. Then they would either 
have to use spotter units, or fire blind. It would be a little more 
realistic, and may reduce the advantages of long range units so they 
don't have to be slowed down to a snail's pace.

Ground units should be able to take much more damage that flying 
units. 



My favortite custom upgrades post (7):
Many people have suggested custom upgrades, variable weapons and so-
forth. There has always been the problem that they introduce too much 
miromanagement and make the game too complex.
I understand this concern, and agree wholeheartedly. I also believe 
that a good upgrade system would add a lot to the game. Because of 
this, I have spent a while trying to come up with a good system of 
upgrades that would work for starcraft.
Well, here it is. My suggestion on how custom upgrades can work for 
YOU.


First of all, it's important that there are a lot of different units 
in starcraft. I don't just mean having a great number of units, but 
also a few units to select from for a given task. You need more than 
one basic ground attack units that is always used since it is 'the 
best'.
I believe you need two or three basic front-line attack units, a 
couple of different support units and a selection of spacecraft and 
infantry. In addition to adding variety to the game, it allows for 
more strategic unit usage, and makes the whole game look more 
appealing.
A good example might be the terran 'Goliath' mech. There should be 
another unit which is fairly similar. Have a mech called the 
'Sentinel' and give it lasers. You might even get away with using the 
same (or similar) graphic. They should not be greatly different from 
each other.

Now, since there are a large number of units, rather than customise 
weapons or actually alter individual units, you just make the 
upgrades affect one unit type. You upgrade all the goliath mechs 
guns, for example. Other units are not affected.

Furthermore, the upgrades on each unit should be mutually exclusive. 
At the simplest level, you could upgrade a heavy tank's speed or 
armour, but not both. If you upgrade armour then all heavy tanks gain 
better armour, but cannot have their speed improved. This means that 
players will upgrade the units to suit their playing style. Another 
example might be weather to upgrade a unit's anti-aircraft weapons or 
it's ground attack weapons. This is a simplification, of course, but 
it's useful to see what I mean.

This is even better when you consider that there should be several 
units capable of any given task. Assume that you keep upgrading heavy 
tanks with armour, defensive systems, etc. On the other hand, you 
upgrade your mechs with speed and firepower. Two similar basic attack 
units are now suited to the rolls you like to use them for. Best of 
all, this would really improve the multiplayer aspect. You would have 
to find out how a player liked to customise their units, so you could 
fight them effectively. Players could even make unexpected changes in 
the roles of their units to confuse people.

I'm not saying that the change should be all that drastic, certainly 
there should still be slow, assault units and quick recon units and 
you can't customise them to be anything else. I just think you should 
be able to 'tweak' unit characteristics. 

Perhaps the easiest way of doing this would be to allow each unit 
type a set number of upgrades. 

Example: Assume a mech is able to upgrade speed, armour, chainguns 
and missiles all to a max level of 5 (20 upgrades in all). 
You might allow a mech to make 16 upgrades, meaning that two mechs 
from different sides could be quite different when maxed out. If 
you're using your mechs to fend off air assaults, you might not 
upgrade guns at all. That would make the unit fearsome at taking out 
aircraft, but you'd want to have some other units around if they 
enemy landed ground troops.
A Protoss scout could upgrade guns, shield, speed, manouverability 
and missiles. You could make a fast, hit and run unit, or a 
dogfighter, or whatever.

Another possibility is using this as another difference between the 
races. 

My first idea on this was the humans might be able to fit 75&#37; of 
possible options on any given unit (15 of 20 upgrades). The Protoss, 
with better technology, might be able to cram in up to 90&#37; (18 of 
20). 
It does have the problem of making the Protoss tougher over time, 
however.

I recently came up with a better idea, though. It states that the 
more technologically advanced races can specialise more.
Let's say that any unit can be upgraded 16 times (16 'points'). 
Humans can go to a maximum level of 5. Protoss can go up to 8.

This means that the Protoss can customise the units to a specific 
role far more, without being any more powerful. They get the same 
number of upgrades, but can use them more strategically. I really 
think that this makes a lot of sense. Just look at the evolution of 
comabt aircraft.

In world war 1 there were aircraft. Just one type of craft did all 
the dogfighting, bombing, etc.

In world war 2, planes were basically just fighters or bombers. There 
were a few others, but mainly just the two specialist aircraft.

Nowadays? There are dogfighting aircraft, bobmbers, stealth bombers, 
stealth fighters, spy planes, ground attack aircraft, 3 or 4 types of 
tank busting planes, VTOL, STOL, fixed wing, variable wing, jet, 
propeller, turbojet, helicopters, and probably a lot more. 

As technology advances, it becomes more specific. One thing to do one 
job REALLY well. Why not have the game reflect this? 

I think it would be great to have this kind of flexibility. Just 
about it: 
The protoss upgrade the scout's manouverability to massive levels. 
The humans cannot match it, and will loose a lot of units in even 
dogfights. Instead, they upgrade the speed of their attack aircraft 
so it can zip in for hit and run strikes. 
You would really have to think about what you wanted each unit for. 
It would even give you an incentive NOT to upgrade straight away, but 
to wait and see what the enemy was doing...


Recently, Iolaus suggested that acceleration should affect units. I 
think this would be a very good addition, and should be upgraded with 
manouverability. Also suggested was the upgrading of buildings, which 
is another good idea.

Buildings should be upgraded individually, and could upgrade 
production speed, production efficiency, armour, weapons (if any), 
and a 'special' dependant on race (Zerg healing, terran speed, 
protoss some kind of power reserve so the loss of a pylon does not 
hurt right away). This means you could make buildings better at 
producing if it's well protected, or better at resisting attacks if 
it's an easy target.
Units could upgrade each weapon, armour, speed, manouverability, 
shield (if any), regeneration (if appropriate).</pre>
