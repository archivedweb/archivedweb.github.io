&#62;   When I first heard about the little critters that made their life

&#62; hooked to the Zerg species. I thought that the real affect of the 
&#62; knowledge that they where going to die any way, they might as well 
&#62; put a few chunks of damage onto the enemy. 
&#62; ---&#62; My question is, what ever happend to those critters 
&#62; (Avengers)?
&#62;      Do you plan on sticking them in the Full Version. I could give 
&#62; you a reason to. &#60;-&#62;   If someone had a huge map which was 
&#62; based to only use Air units, then someone playing the Zerg would 
&#62; surley fall. Most of their units are ground. (From the knowledge I 
&#62; have)

First off, I'm sure Blizzard would not leave the Zerg with only 
Mutalisks and Defilers to go up against fleets of Terran/Protoss 
starships.  I would think that every race (Zerg included) have at 
least two or three units that no one has seen.

As for the Avengers, their name implies that their purpose is to get 
revenge for the death of an Overlord (which seems like a pretty 
important unit).  I would expect them to die out quickly, living for 
ten seconds or so to avenge the death of their host.  They could also 
ensure that a player will need more than a little SCV to take out an 
isolated and otherwise defenseless Overlord.  Probably small with a 
nasty bite, kind of like interceptors.  I don't think that Avengers 
would be like a conventional spacecraft that you can amass in 
preparation for an attack (i.e. Wraiths, Battlecruisers, Arbiters, 
Carriers, every other air unit).

&#34;Hey, he's coming towards us.  Why is Death coming towards 
us?!?&#34;
