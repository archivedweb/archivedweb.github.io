&#62; I just went to some guy's website and have some new questions about 
&#62; the Protoss:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Will one protoss unit be able to take on 2 terran or 4 zerg?
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  How much of a defense will that blue shield put up against 
&#62; attacks on the protoss?( i saw the 
&#62; blue shields on a bunch of screen shots)
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  What is a Nexus?
&#62; 
&#62; 4.  Will the Protoss get to call down something like a nuclear strike?
&#62; 
&#62; 5.  How well can Templars fight?
&#62; 
&#62; 6.  Are Templars the peons of the Protoss, so to speak?
&#62; 
&#62; 7.  If I was to team up with other Protoss warriors on B.net, could I 
&#62; &#34;magically&#34; warp to their base 
&#62; or use a Nexus (if I knew what one was).
&#62; 
&#62; 8.  What will the mercenaries be like?
&#62; 
&#62; 9.  Will critters fight back?
&#62; 
&#62; 10.  Lastly, in missions where you are in an installation, can u make 
&#62; more units?
&#62; 
&#62; Thanx,
&#62; Jay Da' Pimp

1. 2 Terran and 4 zerg?  At least, buuud-dy, if you use them right... 
Then again, if they use THEIR units right, it could be less...

2.  Ah, dunno if buildings have shields, but it is a possibility.  
The shields themselves are tough, and recharge twice as fast when 
near a shield battery. Attacking a Protoss base is not going to be in 
the same galaxy as easy...

3. Nexus is the main Protoss building.  I could be wrong, but it 
serves the same functions as a typical main building.

4. Ah, dunno.  Almost certainly, but I don't know if they need it...  
Every race probably has something imaginatively nasty, but you'll be 
relieved to know that there are ways of dealing with them, so they 
arn't the be all and end all.

5. Beware the Templars, beware the Templars...

6. No way!  I WISH! The Shuttle is the Peon for the Protoss, the 
Templars, Zealots and High Templars are translated into &#34;Oh fuck 
NO!&#34; as they trash my base.  Peons they ain't.

7. No idea.

8. Ah, Mercs get paid to trash the enemy.  Thats as much as I know.

9.  Some critters will indeed fight back.  Mmmmm, carnage... 
*gurgle..*

10.  Unknown.  Maybe.  

Hope this was partially helpful.  I have a bad feeling that the 
Protoss are going to have LOTS of fun trashing my Zerg hive...  
Repeatedly..

&#34;Murphy has played his hand.&#34;
&#34;Murphy has ALL the hands.&#34;
&#34;To the victor go the spoils.&#34;
&#34;The day you get my remote control is the day you prise it from 
my cold, dead hands.&#34;
