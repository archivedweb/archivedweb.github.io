<pre>First, thought id say that a full time or two Blizzard corp staff 
member ansewering questions with such regularity shows to me true 
dedication on the part of the game company to its constituancies.  
After all, this is a 'sequal' in a way to the RTS genre begun by 
War2, and what could be better than tons of suggestions?  Im sure 
most are only considered on their merits and limitations, but im sure 
every now and then a really good simple one suprises the company 
pleasantly.

Anyway, my questions were on the documentation, either online or in 
the box, as well as the packaging of the game:

1. -- Will the manual be online?  If so, will it be interactive?  
Manuals have two functions --  to tell you how to install (rather 
obsolete with autoplay,) and play the game, and to immerse you in the 
story line of the game so as to make it a living world rather than 
just some cartoons blowing eachother up.  Now most older people 
prob.ly don't care all that much about the storyline, but for younger 
players its essential to connect them to the universe, rather than 
the gameplay; just the opposite.
       So how have you thought out the documentation?  If you want my 
suggestions, id would seperate the two functions to seperate docs. 
One should be paper, the other online.  But keep them VERY seperate.  
And lose any childishness for the howto docs, so the older folks 
don't get embarressed reading it.  But the other doc can emmerse in 
thourough detail the imagination of the player.  I would make the 
background/story one the paper one in the box, and the instructions 
online (a pop-up autoplay manual, not that crappy Adobe Acrobat 
format -- i HATE that!)  So if ya cared less who was who, chunk the 
inbox manual, or dont even open it (most people dont look at manuals 
till there stuck anyway).  Its these little points which make a good 
game even better.

2. -- Quickie:  What kind of ingame help will there be?  A good fun 
easy help system is always a bonus, and yall know erganomics well 
enough....

3. -- The box packaging?  I thought diablo wouldve been better with a 
black box and just the name.  Advertizing advertizing,  know but its 
important.  Maybe you could have several choises and let the beta 
testers choose at the end of the beta test...?

Thanks for reading, 

Sincerely,
Joshua</pre>
