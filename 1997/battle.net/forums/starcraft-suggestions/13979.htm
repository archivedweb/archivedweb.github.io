&#62; how about some spell or big units that can revive the zerg units or 
&#62; buildings. That will be fun.
&#62; 
&#62; 2- Blizzard! Try this.
&#62; Put more things like heal other of Diablo in SC. Since the alliance 
&#62; will be the key, there must be more things to help otherrs. Also, you 
&#62; should have more kind of things like this but will help your allies 
&#62; more than your empire. Let's say, Protoss have this spell called 
&#62; revive, it's almost useless on protoss units since some of them are 
&#62; mechanical, some of them are organic. But will mean a lot of thing to 
&#62; the zergs cause they are ALL organic even the buildings. So the 
&#62; protoss will be able to revive the buildings too (not all, but part 
&#62; of the building, say like a building need to be cast upon 4 times the 
&#62; spell revive to be functional). But this spell will be useless on 
&#62; terrains cause they are all mechanical units.
&#62; This will make players select their allies carefully to fit their 
&#62; interest. Each race should include many &#34;whatever&#34; like this. 
&#62; So each alliance of two race will have it's good side. The power will 
&#62; be 3 time more powerful than before.(2= two person= 1+1=2) The 
&#62; alliance of three race will make them invincible. (I doubt there will 
&#62; be anyone who is playing 3 vs 3) LAAGGGGGGGGg.
&#62; Long time no see you guys!!!!!!!!!!!!</pre>
