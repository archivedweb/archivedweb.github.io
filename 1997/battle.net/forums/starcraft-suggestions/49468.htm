<blockquote>
<pre>     I have been keeping track of the progress and updates of 
Stracraft on Blizzard's website and the Battle.net site.  I have 
purchased and played Warcraft, Warcraft II, and Diablo.  I enjoy them 
all and I am excited to here about the Diablo expansion pack.  

     My question about Starcraft is the following.  From what I have 
been reading in reviews it seems as if the Protoss and the Zerg are 
going to be the dominant forces in Starcraft.  The one thing I have 
enjoyed is the balance that each race has and does not.  In Warcraft 
II this was obvious.  It seems as if the Terrans are just cannon 
fodder for the Protoss and Zerg.  I think every race should have it's 
strengths and weaknessess but they should not be obvious and easy to 
identify.  This has always been the mix for a great game.  

     My concern is that one race will be vastly superior over the 
others and the game won't be that challenging or fun to play.  I look 
forward to purchasing and playing game.  I have a LAN at home with 6 
PCs.  My concern and Blizzard's to I would hope is to find a balance 
between all the races, each with it's unique strength, weaknessess, 
and benefits.  So if your multi-player gaming on your home LAN, via 
modem, or the battlenet you can pick any race and still have a 
fighting chance.  Where the main factors that determine if you win or 
lose is how you setup your base, manage and deploy your units, and 
your overall stragedy.

     I by no way mean to criticize the programmers efforts.  I know 
the hours they put in are long and hard.  High-tech industries are 
like that.  I am currently working on a project to implement cable 
modem technologies in the Seattle, WA area.  I just hope that 
Starcraft is everything if claims to be and hopefully alot more.


                                                                      
                                 
                                                                      
                                             Sincerely,
