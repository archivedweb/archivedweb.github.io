&#62; Hi, I really like your war games, but there is one thing that really 
&#62; bother me, that is the map size; the map size is too small to have 
&#62; fun with so...if you please ,and I suupose it is not too late now, 
&#62; make that map at lease several times larger.  This will make the game 
&#62; more fun and difficult (in term of challenging)  

    Map design is more important than size. 
 
&#62; There are two ideas that I want to post in here.  First, can you make 
&#62; an option that we can turn a fighting unit to a resource collecting 
&#62; unit?  for example, in war2 if we run out of peasants and still have 
&#62; some footmen or knights, we should be able to turn them to peasants 
&#62; to work and they are able to turn back their normal status with 
&#62; certain prices.
&#62; 
&#62; And another idea is that can you make a surrender option for, say one 
&#62; peasant unit, so it will be captured and works as slave untill 
&#62; another unit comes and rescue it?  and if we we capture a fighting 
&#62; unit, it will turn to a peasant and work untill it is recaptured by 
&#62; another units (not nercessary the same color player).
&#62; 
     I have a feeling this post may have been ignored because you
dont have enough experience in posting, but the slavery idea 
actually isnt that bad. It would be pretty cool to attack a town
and somehow convert peons to your own side, maybe by attacking them
physically? In other words you couldnt just death & decay some peons
and convert them. It would probably be more fair to say that peons
told to attack cant be converted, but if spineless peons are just
choppin some wood, minin some gold, and get attacked.. it'd be nice 
if they could be inslaved instead of just killed.

    Opens up a few probs: Would you have to heal all these slaves?
Could you immidiately attack other peons and units with them?
Maybe they would be &#34;in chains&#34; and controllable but not 
useable
until they visited one of your halls, where they would get all their
health back and become normal peons.

     Ya might grunt rush somebody to steal his peons. Interesting
idea.</pre>
