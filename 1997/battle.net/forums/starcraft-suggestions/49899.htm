&#62;      
&#62; 
&#62;       1.  Unit/Building/Technology restrictor: This is an absolute 
&#62; MUST.  This would allow the mapmaker to label units as 
&#62; &#34;untrainable,&#34; buildings as &#34;unbuildable,&#34; and 
&#62; upgrades as, um, &#34;unupgradeable&#34; :)  The mapmaker should be 
&#62; able to specify which sides are affected by this; player one might be 
&#62; able to build all units, and player 2 might only be able to build 
&#62; SCVs.

Right.  This would be kind of cool, to have a partner, except the 
partner could only build air units, and you could only build ground 
units!  Sort of like a forced alliance, neither side would survive if 
they didn't ally with the other side.

&#62;  
&#62;       2,  Hierarchy Editor, for lack of a better name:  This would 
&#62; allow the mapmaker to change the order in which buildings and units 
&#62; can be built.  For ex. in War2, you had to have a barracks and a 
&#62; lumber mill to build an archer, a barracks and a blacksmith to build 
&#62; a ballista, and you had to have  a barracks to upgrade to a keep. The 
&#62; mapmaker should be able to define and alter these terms, and change 
&#62; the way the game &#34;progresses.&#34;  If you had to have every 
&#62; structure in the game before __________ (really strong unit) could be 
&#62; built, players might think twice about building swarms of ____________
&#62; 

I like this idea, for reasons you will learn in a little bit.

&#62;       3.  Unit Statistics Editor: Start with the awesome War2 editor 
&#62; Daniel Limberg made, and build up.  Besides being able to edit all 
&#62; base stats, the mapmaker should be able to edit both current and max 
&#62; health (you could create wounded units) and both current and max ammo 
&#62; (dueling at dawn :P).  You should be able to edit the weapon for each 
&#62; unit, the projectile for each unit, the sound for each unit, the 
&#62; portrait for each unit, and the graphix for each unit.  If you won't 
&#62; allow us to create our OWN graphics, then atleast let us mix and 
&#62; match the game graphics.
&#62; 

I THINK blizzard has said that we CANT edit the portraits, simply 
because I think they will be a tiny rendered movie.  Otherwise YES!  
This idea rocks.  I think that they should leave a few slots open, 
and let us creat &#34;new&#34; units, in the sense that we would use 
the graphics for say, the wraith, and call it something new, like the 
hornet, make it go a ton faster than the wraith, and give it duel 
flamethrowers, for flying low and taking out infantry (ok, not a 
great idea, but its just an example).  AND you could still build 
Wraiths, PLUS have the option of building hornets.  Ya follow that?

This would also be great for creating a new building.  Take the 
graphics from some other installation, give a new name, and say that 
this building must be built before you can make hornets.

&#62;       4.  Landscape Stat editor: If Starcraft is set up so that there 
&#62; are variable terrains (units walk slow on sand, fast on a road, slow 
&#62; uphill, fast downhill, mechanized units go faster in sand than foot 
&#62; units, etc.) than you should be able to alter the effects of each 
&#62; terrain.  Make it so zerg can walk 2 times as fast on creep than on 
&#62; other terrain, for example (I think this might already be in the 
&#62; game)  also, it would be nice if you could edit the effects the 
&#62; landscapes had on the troops (creep healed the zerg slowly, the 
&#62; protoss homeworld makes the protoss recharge their &#34;magic&#34; 
&#62; bar 2 times faster, the terran world is rich in harvestable metals, 
&#62; etc.)  Maybe you could make it so that there were certain areas that 
&#62; would hurt a unit (make a poisonous forest or swamp).
&#62; 

This idea is ok, but it really isn't as good as all the other ones 
you have.

&#62;      5.  Here's a question: can you make custom installation 
&#62; missions? I hope so.
&#62; 

I believe so!  In fact, I had a really great idea about improving 
installation missions, by having other units be able to 
&#34;Talk&#34;, in that a little line of text would float above their 
head, and they could give hints about the level, like &#34;The north 
corrider is trapped&#34; (I had a much better example when I 
originally posted the message, but it would take to long to type out)

&#62;      6.  If the terran tank can still morph into a permenate, 
&#62; immobile tower, be able to start a map with some already morphed 
&#62; tanks rooted in the earth.  Same goes for any other morphing unit.  
&#62; 

Yes, you should also be able to fill a transport with troops, be able 
to have a building automatically start making a unit when the game 
starts, and have a building be halfway (or whatever percent)completed 
when the game starts.


&#62;      7. Be able to right click on any UNIT (not building) and pull up 
&#62; this menu:
&#62; 
&#62;          A.) Upgrades-lets you add and takeaway upgrades to the unit. 

Yes.  I think this needs no further justification then the obvious.

&#62;          B.) equipment slot-lets you specify what powerup is in the 
&#62; unit's equipment slot.

See point A.

&#62;          C.) preorders- this is something i really like :) this 
&#62; feature would let you give any units that start out on the map one 
&#62; order for them to act out as soon as the game starts.  You could have 
&#62; it so that there is a gigantic enemy base, with units preset to 
&#62; patrol the parimeters as soon as the game starts.  Or, have it so 
&#62; that one of your forces &#34;accidentally&#34; wanders upon a 
&#62; detachment of enemy zergs.  Action right from the start equals 
&#62; satisfaction till the very end :P

Yeah, one of Red Alert's few good points was that they had things 
like a supply truck running back and forth between 2 bases.  You 
know, preprogramming units to follow a direct path, or fulfill a 
certain order.  

&#62;          D.) Posture- lets you specify which direction the unit is 
&#62; looking, and, if there are zerg, if the unit is burrowed in the 
&#62; ground or not.

Hmm. Yes, this may be important with true line of sight.   Another 
thing, is that you should be able to give a unit a battle 
personality, like only attack and pursue if attacked, far patrol, 
close patrol, point patrol (follows waypoints), suicidal, cunning 
buddy, cunning loner, brave buddy, brave loner, and on call (will 
rush to a site of conflict and help) (I stole those from Jagged 
Alliance)

&#62;          E.) If the unit can attack, be able to choose how much ammo 
&#62; it has

I don't see how important this is, since you can always resupply at a 
base.  This would only make a difference in base-less missions.

&#62; 
&#62;       8. Be able to right click on any BUILDING (not unit) and pull 
&#62; up this menu:
&#62;          A.) If the building can train troops, be able to select a 
&#62; troop that will be immediately built, when the game starts (be able 
&#62; to choose whether the building of this troop takes any resources or 
&#62; not). if there is queuing, be able to choose how many of this troop 
&#62; are being built.
&#62;          B.)  Be able to choose if this building can be infested.
&#62;          C.)  If the building can attack, be able to choose how much 
&#62; ammo it has.
&#62;          D.) Be able to give the building a command (this would most 
&#62; likely just be for the terrans, and the command would be to move 
&#62; somewhere.)
&#62;          
&#62;          
&#62; 

All good suggestions, and one more thing:  Be able to specify how 
many units a building will produce, and how often it will produce it. 
 Some things could be:  Build X amount of Y unit, every Z minutes.  
Replace any units lost, but do not produce more than started with.  
If marines &#60; 50 then produce marines until marines = 50

&#62;      Thats pretty much it for now.  If some of these suggestions have 
&#62; been said before, then the person gets full credit :) I'll post more 
&#62; later.
&#62; 

In conclusion, I would like to say that ALL of these ideas would add 
GREATLY to the mission generation aspect of StarCraft, and should be 
SERIOUSLY considered.
