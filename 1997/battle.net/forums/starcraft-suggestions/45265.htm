&#62; guess what, read the title...
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Im serious, here i am, looking for some GOOD game to wait for 
&#62; starcraft playing, so i heard bout AoE.. so i waste 1 afternoon 
&#62; downloading it

1 afternoon?  Why the hell would you sit by your computer doing 
nothing while DLing?  MOST people do something else while waiting.

 (including having to download directX 5.0 afterwards 
&#62; jus to run it) and so, i played it... HA! it has 15 'tribes' 
&#62; supposedly unique, (insane laugh) yer joking!

As unique as they were historically.  Militarily speaking, ancient 
civs weren't that different.  For example, at some point most used 
chariots, then later heavy infantry groups, etc.  These kids keep 
expecting to find orcs and ogres in a historical sim. 

 the 'tribes'were 
&#62; identical! only differences are that some can and can't build some 
&#62; nits/buildings!

If there is a difference, then they are not identical.  Ever notice 
the Hittites' War Galley has +6 range, and the Egyptians +0?  

 pethetic!

Learn to spell.

 and all the game was, was a war2 CLONE!

Not really.  the only resembelance is that you use villagers to 
gather resources.

  and it was completely unbalenced!

No, it wasn't, and learn to spell.

 if u had war 
&#62; ships, you can wipe out ANY land units/buildings near shore (keepin 
&#62; in mind, EVERY board has water, stupid, i know)

That is why you play against humans.  They know how to counter these 
things.  

 without a doubt.  and 
&#62; the computer always attacks with the same units every time, same 
&#62; ammount to.

Play on Hard.  Then the AI attacks strong, and alot.  

  And the demo (even though u'd think the size of the demo 
&#62; would not make this # so low) has a unit limit of 50, not even a 
&#62; reasonable limit,

It IS a reasonable limit, since MOST GOOD HUMAN PLAYERS can use their 
units more effectively than the AI.  The size of the demo was mostly 
for the graphics.  

 i have no idea where the 20 megs outta the 23 megs 
&#62; the file is went, it sure doesn't show
  beleive me, if yer lookin 
&#62; for a GOOD demo, download NetStorm... its a helluva lot better...

Netstorm sucks.  It is like C&C, minus strategy, and plus lame units. 
 All it is is sandbagging from C&C made into the main part of the 
game.

Too many of you lamer kids play AOE, and expect orcs, ogres, zerg, 
and God knows what else.  You won't find these.  What you will find 
is an EXCELLENT historicaly accurate game.  It isn't meant to have 
races that are diverse.  They have their differences that alter 
playstyle.  It also requires THINKING, which is why some of you don't 
like C&C1, LOTR2, etc., because they are too much for your little 
brain to handle.  Rapid mouse clicking, not thinking, is all you 
brats can do.  And the sad thing is most of you suck at that, too.</pre>
