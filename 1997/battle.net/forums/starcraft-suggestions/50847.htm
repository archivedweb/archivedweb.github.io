<pre>Dear AdamM,

     AdamM we will never foget you.  Even though I never got any of 
my 
questions answered by you (or any anyone else  hehe).  Anyway, I
would like to thank you for all the kind support you gave to all of us
who have no life, and sit around playing Blizzard games, and spamming 
forums. (Not that, that is me or anything).  We will always remember 
you 
AdamM.  You were one fo the greats!

&#62; First things first:  I'm impressed.  I've been gone since friday and 
&#62; there hasn't been one fake AdamM post.  we've come a long way. ;)  
&#62; 
&#62;    Anyway this forum became a huge part of my life and I felt bad 
&#62; that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye on my last day (all 
&#62; hallow's eve).  What Pat said was true, I have left Blizzard to work 
&#62; at another company.  I don't want to mention which company here on 
&#62; the forums.  That wouldn't be fair to Blizzard.  I'm not here to 
&#62; generate free press for my new job. ;)   Let me say that I left 
&#62; Blizzard on great terms, I have a lot of friends there (nod's to Pat, 
&#62; Alen, Andrew, Twain, Robert, John, Mike, Vic, Allen, Mike M, Mike O, 
&#62; Scott M, The other Scott &#60;ops man extroidanaire&#62;, Brandon, 
&#62; Kirk, Lim, and of course Dana, and oh my god I almost forgot 
&#62; Metzen!).  So no rumors about how I left over an argument or 
&#62; something please. ;)  
&#62; 
&#62;    I can't and won't give any info about Starcraft away, I'm sorry, 
&#62; but I love Blizzard too much to &#34;jump the gun&#34; on any cool 
&#62; new announcements or features they have.  Let me tell you people, if 
&#62; you can get a job at Blizzard, get one.  My time there generated so 
&#62; many cool stories and memories that I _know_ I'll never forget it.  
&#62; OF course with all the people I know there, and the fact that I'm 
&#62; still in the game industry, forgetting such an amazing company would 
&#62; be impossible. ;)  
&#62;    
&#62;    Wow...  For the first time in a forum post I'm not sure what to 
&#62; say...  You people F'in rock.  I will well and truly miss being the 
&#62; answer guy for everyone here.  That doesn't mean I won't still be 
&#62; lurking in the background though.  I'm looking forward to this game 
&#62; as much as, possibly more then, everyone here is.  This is going to 
&#62; the strat game that redefines what makes a good RTS game.  
&#62; 
&#62; One last thing:  To Cheese Monkey - I did pose your questions to the 
&#62; developers, the topic is till under discussion.  That's why the 
&#62; Uberlist never had an answer for you.  In the end it comes down to 
&#62; how much it will add to the game versus how much it slow the game 
&#62; down or whatever.  &#60;shrug&#62;  I just didn't want to leave with 
&#62; you thinking I had snubbed you or anything. ;)
&#62; 
&#62; - AdamM
&#62; Also, to those that wanted my e-mail address...  again I won;t answer 
&#62; questions about Starcraft...  I have a riddle for you, if you can 
&#62; figure it out you'll find the index page (currently at about 10:50pm 
&#62; pacific time) another post by me is on with my e-mail address there.  
&#62; So here is the riddle/trivia question:
&#62; 
&#62;    What character from a British television show said:  &#34;Who is 
&#62; number 1?&#34; and &#34;Be seeing you.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Here's a hint:  The person that played this character was also in 
&#62; Braveheart.
&#62; 
&#62; And for all the B.net tech support regulars...  This one's for you:
&#62; Note: We answer your questions in the order you appear on the list at 
&#62; right.  We will _|NOT|_ take questions out of order, so please be 
&#62; patient until we call on you.
&#62; 
&#62; ;)
