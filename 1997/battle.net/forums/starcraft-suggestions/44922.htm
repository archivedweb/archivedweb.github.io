<blockquote>
<pre>I was thinking of some possible scm.'s I could make and then I had 
some questions.

1.  How many AI's are there?

2.  What are the different AI's?

3.  Can you set the difficulty of the AI's?

4.  When you create a heroe, can you just take a regular unit or 
heroe and tell the map editor you want a heroe that looks like this 
or is it more restricted to something like, adjust Lothar's stats and 
name?

5.  Can you make two different heroes with different stats and names 
but with the same GFX?

6.  If you have a multi campain and some of the players have to kill 
each other, how do you get to the next level?

7.  In a multi campain, can you have a unit gain levels through out 
the game and adjust it's stats for certain levels without it losing 
it's levels?

8.  Can you set units on a premade path?  This would be cool for a 
mission where you had to keep a heroe which you cannot control alive 
and he/she was just following your premade path through ambushes.

9.  Is there a certain number of scenarios that have to be in a 
custom campain?  Is there a maximum?

10. (Not a question)  I really think there should be walls.  I want 
to make a prison camp in the middle of the mountains without having 
to make another scenario with instalation tileset.

That's about it... for now... :)
