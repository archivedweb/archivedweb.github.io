&#62; 
&#62; First, In the StarCraft map editor, you should make it so you can 
&#62; make buildings UNBUILDABLE! That way users can make missions that the 
&#62; player can't build certain buildings. Make a PAINT tool in the map 
&#62; editor PLEASE!
&#62; 
&#62; Second, units should look different when they are upgraded, more 
&#62; armor, better looking weapons when they shoot, etc.
&#62; 
&#62; Make it so allies can use the same transport, mabye even the same 
&#62; town hall.  Or an option that you and your ally control one color. 
&#62; For example, two people are using yellow. 
&#62; 
&#62; If you really want to you can make a race editor! People can then 
&#62; MAKE their own races and buildings! The editor will allow you to draw 
&#62; sprites for the characters and edit what the buildings look like! 
&#62; People could create a whole new race and people could battle with 
&#62; their own races if the opponent has that race on their computer also. 
&#62; So in other words, a sprite, building and strength editor! THAT WOULD 
&#62; BE MEGA COOL!
&#62; 
&#62; Also, units could have multiple weapons! I mech could be equipped 
&#62; with unlimited laser cannons (weak) and 2 missiles (strong). In order 
&#62; to get more milles the player would have to send the mach back to the 
&#62; outfit shop and buy more missiles.
&#62; 
&#62; Blizzard, I really hope you read this and if you use any suggestions, 
&#62; write back please. 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Thanx, ever loyal fan, Bounty Hunter 

Well bounty hunter, I agree that Blizzard Entertainment should try to 
include all of this, but I think that if they added this much, 
knowing that they might have unlimited unit upgrading, might cause 
the game to be too big for any system to run.  Also this will cause 
Starcraft to take at least another 1/2 year to come out.</pre>
