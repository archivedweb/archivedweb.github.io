&#62; in war2 after playing awhile you learn the maps pretty well and it 

&#62; takes the fun out of it on the net. (so if u can make a map for the 

&#62; net that u select so it randomly creates a new map each time, kinda 

&#62; like diablo and the dungeons it will make it MUCH better gameplay) 

&#62; noone can memorize the maps.



No, that would really not be good. Diablo was just a click-click-
click kill all the monsters game and it didn't really matter that you 
knew where you were going.



Good Warcraft 2 maps are carefully designed around good gameplay- 
taking into account player balance, mobility, usually a 
&#34;theme&#34;. A random map would SUCK. I mean it would suck hard-
core.  It would just be a scramble of trees, mud, grass, rocks, and 
water, with inaccesible gold mines and wildly unbalanced player 
starting positions. It would have no theme, no style, and no purpose. 
 &#34;Artificial intelligence&#34; still can't design a great map 
like Garden of War, or Rivers, or No Way Out of This Maze.



And I don't know what you mean when you say Internet Warcraft 2 play 
is less fun when you know the map. It's ONLY fun when you know the 
map. I even downloaded maps of the maps and studied them so I 
wouldn't have to play on a map I had never seen. It puts you at a 
major disadvantage, and it's no fun wandering around for 30 seconds 
to find your mine and then building up to a stronghold before you 
realize it's a water map.



I didn't like Diablo's random maps. Maybe that's because I didn't 
like anything about the game, but that's another story. 

What was wrong with it is instead of making each map look different, 
after a while they all looked exactly the same.</pre>
