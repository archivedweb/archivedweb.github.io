&#62; &#62; &#62;  It's OK. We all know you can't help the way you are.
&#62; &#62; &#62;  Btw, got any good Starcraft Suggestions?

&#62; &#62; Here is one good suggestion I thought of...
&#62; &#62; (Hey UNIX Fans!!!)
&#62; &#62; ps -fe | egrep 'the weak|the lame|the unintelligent' &#62; Iolaus Fan 
&#62; &#62; Club
&#62; &#62; cat Iolaus Fan Club | cut -d' ' -f3 | KILL
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;Yadda 
&#62; Yadda
&#62; Yadda				C'mon Sommykins, it ain't that bad :)
&#62; 				ps Got any Starcraft Suggestions?

  Ahh yes.  It seems I have over estimated your intelligence yet 
again Iolaus.  A mistake that is becoming far to common.   I thought 
you might have fair sport trying to figure out what this standard 
UNIX command does(and the message therein).  However, it seems that 
the Computer Department at Foothills has failed to convey even the 
most rudimentary fundamentals of computer science--regular 
expressions.  I guess the quality of education in community colleges 
these day's just isn't what it used to be.  
 
  It is also interesting to note that one of your lower 
minions(KROWA) didn't even know that it was a command line and 
likened it to himself &#34;banging&#34; on a keyboard.  I find it 
amazing that an individual with this level of intelligence could even 
turn a computer on.  Much less find his way to this forum and spread 
his abhorrent stupidity across the Internet.  
  
   Speaking of spreading abhorrent stupidity--I noticed you have quit 
submitting posts that contain anything resembling intelligence.  It 
seems all you do now is wait by the computer all day until I post 
something.  At which time you quickly spring into action and add your 
cute little dainty comments.  Many people (not just me) have noticed 
this.  How you used to have somewhat meaningful things to say.   Now 
you've been reduced to publishing your snide drivel any chance you 
can get.  This is truly sad Iolaus.  

  You must be truly unhappy with the person you are to vicariously 
live  your life in this tiny forum.  I've said it once...I'll say it 
again...my condolences to your mother on birthing a child of such 
embarassing caliber.
                                    with regards
                                    -SOMMS</pre>
