&#62; As any TRUE strategist knows,
&#62;       For defeating an enemy of the same size or somewhat greater, 
&#62; the trick is to position your forces to which they can attack at full 
&#62; strength and numbers, while the enemy is forced to deal with a 
&#62; greater force wherever he chooses to attack or defend.  
&#62; 
&#62; How is this strategy accomplished?  Not by simple selections and 
&#62; movements... It is done with formations and synchronized attack.  
&#62; Synchronized attacking and formations are very similar in that they 
&#62; both deal with the individual speed of the units in the situation.
&#62; 
&#62;     This has been the problem with RTSs ever since the beginning. -
&#62; The RTS engines of today, have not been powerful enough to support 
&#62; cohesive tactical maneuvers of formations and synchronized action.  
&#62; 
&#62; Never could you get your tanks to slow down and stay with the 
&#62; infantry.
&#62; Never could you get your knights to escort the catapults.
&#62; Never could your archers march in formation behind footmen.
&#62; 
&#62; AND, In order for a player to have a combined attack, with different 
&#62; types of units, all attack at the same time, he had to do minute 
&#62; calculations and all the while, his opponent was growing stronger.
&#62; When all the combat groups (control 1,2,3, ect..) had been formed, 
&#62; and everybody was in place, and it was time to &#34;move out&#34;  
&#62; GUESS WHAT HAPPENED!  They all got mixed with the other combat 
&#62; groups.... forming the, oh so common, mass of writhing, dying, 
&#62; unorganized mob of pixelated soldiers.  Pathetic?  I said it... 
&#62; 
&#62; Don't talk to me about a &#34;formations&#34; option, 'cause I know 
&#62; why it won't work.  Just why it didn't work in C&C/RA and why it 
&#62; won't work in the upcoming MYTH...  Has anyone checked out Bungies 
&#62; page on Myth? 
&#62; Get this, it says this above various screen shots....  &#34;Look at 
&#62; the various formations you will have to master.&#34;  That's a bunch 
&#62; of crap, because the soldiers in Myth are BITMAPPED...  They are 
&#62; sprites, therefore having set walking speeds to fit their sprites 
&#62; graphics. (Anyone want to try and counter this, go ahead 'cause I 
&#62; have proof)

You are only partially correct. Some units do not directly animate to 
move (like the zeplin or the ships in war2). The speed of these units 
is variable.

It's also possible to speed up and slow down animation so the units 
still remain in sync with their movement. If you've ever seen the 
war2 alpha version, the ogres walked (and animated) slower. 

You are still making a valid point, however, since you can't alter 
animation speed too much. Walking slowly has a different gait to 
running, and just slowing down the animation speed won't work.

Still, it's possible to change speeds quite a bit, especially for 
units like tanks that only need animation speed changed. Units like 
the marines, templars, mechs, etc present more of a problem. 
Might I suggest a second set of animations for these units? 
If they had a set of 'walking frames' they could travel at a slow 
speed. This means that all the units would have enough of a variation 
in speeds so that a group would be able to stay in formation.

It might mean that sometimes a group would move a fraction slower 
than they had to, but it's an acceptable loss.

It probably wouldn't even use much memory, since most of the 
animation frames would be the same. You might only have to add 1 or 2 
frames per unit, and even them only really the walkers.


&#62; 
&#62; CAN anyone tell me how one is to form a useful formation of combined 
&#62; types with soldiers who can only move at different speeds?
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Well, The formations reform when all the units stop.&#34; -I.E. 
&#62; RA and the upcoming Myth.   
&#62;    I say, What good is a formation of attack, when it only reforms 
&#62; when it reaches it's destination?  It's hardly worth the effort.
&#62; 
&#62; So, I implore you Blizzard.  Please support a way point system in 
&#62; Starcraft that is useful and do not put in a &#34;formations&#34; 
&#62; option, unless it will actually work.
&#62; 
&#62; FATE
&#62; 


I agree there. Useless options are far worse that no options, since 
they clutter the display, complicate control and delay work on more 
important things.</pre>
