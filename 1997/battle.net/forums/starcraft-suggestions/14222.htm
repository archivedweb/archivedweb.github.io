<blockquote>
<pre>17) Mines.  There should be a unit that can lay mines.  This way you 
could make a mine field in front of your base.  This wold be good for 
you but also bad.  If you forgot you could lead your troops into th 
mines.

18) Motion sensors.  They should be little pods and they could e 
placed out side your base and hey would sense mmotion.  This could 
give you an early alert.  In war2 the only time I new someone was 
coming to my base was when it was attacking it.

19) Zerg shooters.  The zerg should have ones that have tails and 
they shoot out little needles.  This would be cool because they could 
shoot in front of them by bringing its tail around and behind.  

20) Self Destruct.  This would be a feature on some units.  if you 
would be about to die you could destroy your self and take some of 
them bastards with you.  Although this would get your enimies mad.

21) Terrain defaults.  You could alter the land by having units that 
do that.  Like Zerg trench diggers, or Protoss blockade builders.  I 
wanted to make a mot when i played war2 and this could be like it.  

22) Strip Mines.  You could blow up the ground and mine it there.  
This would allow you to make a mine close to you.  But this would 
provide much much less.  You would build a platform then drill down 
and blow out the ground.

23) Terrain casulaties.  This would be like if the peons wearing 
almost nothing froze  to death.  So if you were in the ice lands of 
some planet the marines would get sike or die from the cold.  Maybe 
the ciruits of the ships would freeze up.  And in the desert they 
could die of exhaustion.

24) Edible Zerg.  I think that since the Zerg are organic they should 
be used as food when killed.  You could kill a Zerg and collect the 
remains and then take it back to the farm(SC terms) and use it as 
food.  This would be new and interesting.

25) Tracks in the ground.  There should be tracks where units walk.  
This would add a need for stradegy and tactics.  Then you could track 
downthe enimy and kill them.

26) Pulses.  The protoss should send out a shockwave like the spell 
Nova from Diablo.  This might hurt your other units when you cast it 
put it would also attack the enimy.

Thats all for Version 1.2 of All my Ideas
