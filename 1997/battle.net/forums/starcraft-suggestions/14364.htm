<pre>     There are some arguments over this.  Lord Xonthar suggested that 
you be able to enter the game at any time, the advantage going to the 
earliest players, of course.  I like the idea of being able to come 
in at any time, like Diablo.  BUTTT, you can't really compare Diablo 
to Starcraft, because they are in totally different genres.  In 
Diablo, Whether you started a game at the beginning, or got into a 
game that has been going on for an hour, you still had the same 
objective:  Kill all the little devils :)  BUT, in Starcraft, 
depending on your starting location, your allies, your enemies 
starting location, all this will make or break the game.  Here is 
where my suggestion comes in :)

    I think it would be cool to give control of one side to the 
computer, until a new player comes in to control that side.  FOR 
EXAMPLE :) ::::: Players 1,2,3,7, & 8 all start a game.  NOW, they 
can either just make it a 5 person game, or they can set the other 3 
slots to Computer Controlled, or something.  Then, when they start 
the game, the computer controlled sides will do everything as usual, 
behaving just like the singly player computer.  HOWEVER, it will not 
attack.  It is passive, continually building and such.  If someone 
sees this game, and decides to join, they will pick the computer 
controlled player they want to be, and now they have control of the 
units.  This could cause some problems, because it would be easy for 
a human controlled player to go in and wipe out the computer's base, 
for some quick points.  Maybe you could choose what the computer 
does, instead of just being passive (like War2, where they could be 
land attack, air attack, or sea attack, etc.)  MAYBE,,, you could go 
even farther, and choose this computer controlled player to ally with 
a human controlled player, until a human comes in to take its place.  

    Please post any replies/questions/comments/suggestions.

                                                    Thanks,
                                                        Ugly the Cute</pre>
