<pre>     *Damn it, why do I always get the harveting assignments?*
     Col. Jared Hiltman stood by the now for-some-unknown-reason 
defunct site harvester.  A medium, but annoying contraption about the 
size of a standard rock-skimmer, this particular harvester had been 
giving him problems all day long, figured that the damn thing would 
break down too.  Wiping the sweat from his dark-skinned brow, Jared 
looked up at the afternoon sun, checked his time-piece then turned 
back to the machine.
    *Only 3:00 by earth hours.. great, I've got another 5 hours of 
this left, and I don't feel like picking through the debri and doing 
a focol-scan.*
     Opening the storage chest on the side of the contraption, he 
noted.. and was not at all surprised to find out; that the tech-kit 
had been removed.  If it hadn't been stolen by Larec, then chances 
are the military removed it, and placed it on some-ones Wraith for 
&#34;Emergency repairs&#34;.
     *Figures, since I'LL be the one who has to go out and repair the 
damned Wraith if it's shot down anyway.... and if Larec has been 
going through MY equipment again because he can't remember his own, 
I'll kill 'em.  I swear to God I'll kill!*
      Turning towards his Marine Issused Vulture &#34;Dead-Eye&#34; 
which he had landed about 50 yards away he shouted:
      &#34;Hey, Barnes! Get on the Radio, unless they plan to drop 
either another tech-kit, or the whole friggin repair depo on us, 
we're going to go back to base!&#34;
        Barnes Fashite... a light-skinned tech, who had been working 
with him for about Earth-months now, appeared at the hatch.
       &#34;It's your hide if we go back without anything from that 
klunker out there, what happened?  You let it run out of Sipihon gas? 
We can spare some from our fuel tank..&#34;
        &#34;No, the T.K.'s missin! Just get on the air will you? I 
don't want to be swelting like a merf out here! And if they give you 
any trouble blame Larec.. everyone else does, so we might as well 
have our turn this time!&#34;
         Shaking his head, Jared turned back to the machine.  *Didn't 
the MSC know they were in the middle of a damn war?!  Last time he 
checked they were.. after all, HE was hired to go out and save the 
wreckage from the downed Terrain ships...*
         &#34;They say to stay put!&#34;  Barnes voice came from the 
open hatch.  &#34;They'll have a new harvester out here within the 
hour..&#34;
         *Thank God for small mircles* Jared shook his head.  *Guess 
we're desparte for resources if they have to keep us here, usually 
they send us back, yell at us, give us the parts, yell at us again, 
then ship us out... unless...* A feelingh came over Jared.. one he 
didn't like.
        &#34;Hey Barnes.. get on the Radar, why the hell are we going 
to be kept out here?&#34;
        &#34;I already have.. and yep, we going to have company..&#34;
        &#34;Speak sweet to me man&#34;
        &#34;Wish I could sir, looks like it's a single blip..&#34; 
Barnes paused.
        *Most likely for dramatic effect* Thought Jared.  &#34;Well, 
you going to tell me Barnes? I'm no Protoss, and I HATE guessing!&#34;
         &#34;It's a living creature sir..looks like it's ETA is 
about.. 7 minutes.&#34;
         *Well there goes my insurance.. and I was so hoping to keep 
my outfit blood free today*  Jared started to run back to the ship, 
leaving the harvester out side.
          &#34;Power her up Barnes! We're going to have some 
excitement around here..&#34;


Let me know if I should contiune the story, or stop it here... thanx 
for reading, and sorry if this was lame.
