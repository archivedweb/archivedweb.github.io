<pre>I dont know about you but the more work they put into a game the more 
I want it! When I got War2 I played it day after day and im still 
playing it years after (Best $50 I ever spent on a game) But Then I 
got DR and I stoped playing within a week :-( If Blizzard thinks that 
they can make the game better and needs more time then Make it so.....

P.S Blizzard is the best Comp out there! Every game I got from them I 
still play over and over and it just gets better and better.




&#62; The initial excitement caused by StarCraft has faded out.  I dont 
&#62; know if this something that Blizzard cares about but it is happening. 
&#62;  Even us die hard fans of the Blizzard rts games have gotten much 
&#62; more cynical.  Blizzards quest for perfection, though admirable, has 
&#62; had a side effect of stringing the public on too long.  The magazines 
&#62; have lost interest on this game because they have nothing to say. 
&#62; There is no updates to publish, the public hungers for new news.  
&#62; Take Quake 2 for instance.  I am fairly sure that it has been in the 
&#62; works less time than StarCraft, flame away if i am wrong, yet it 
&#62; brought out a semi working demo.  The attached readme states that it 
&#62; is a &#34;compatibility&#34; test, and there would be bugs.  What 
&#62; this means for publicity though is all the Quake fans now have or are 
&#62; in the process of downloading the game.  This in turn creates a 
&#62; hunger, give people some and they want all.  Blizzard, though the 
&#62; uberlists are nice, has not done nearly as much as other companies 
&#62; when it comes to grabbing the publics attention.  Even this forum is 
&#62; filled with more junk, spam and flames than actual StarCraft talk. 
&#62; Why?  We have talked about everything we could based on the 
&#62; information given.  Now we just sit and twiddle our thumbs and become 
&#62; impatient.
