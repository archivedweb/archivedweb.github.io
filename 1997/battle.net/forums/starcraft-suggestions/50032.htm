<pre>To Blizzard Employees:

Has any sort of descision been made on optional naming of objects in 
the game?
    (It would be much appreciated if you kept this to large, hard to  
    come by things, and made sure it was OPTIONAL. I don't want to    
  name every peon I make.)

Will each separate Artificial Intellegence player operate under its 
own set of objectives? (Even if that includes fighting other computer 
players)

Thanks for this page, and letting us little users give you input. 
Please let those great game designers and the programmers pumping out 
code know that we, the people really love the work they do. Some of 
us know how much work goes into writing excellent code that compiles, 
runs, is robust, and never crashes. Keep up the great work guys.   


To all:

Yes, I know my message did not contain any suggestions or comments 
about Starcraft. This one will, guarunteed. Now, I had hoped that  
responses to my posting would be postive in agreement. However, I 
have only recieved typical emotional responses. Please, I am not 
nearly stupid enough to notice that MY message did not contain a 
suggestion about Starcraft. However, despite your flaming messages, I 
have acheived my purpose in posting that particular message. You read 
it, considered it, and formed an opinion about it. So,  though only 
two of you replied to it, many others read it. So next time they post 
another pointless message, they will think about the fact that it has 
nothing to do with the point of this page. 

To the guy with the web page:

Hey, I understand you've constructed a web page, and need to 
advertise it, for I too have a web page. But this is neither the 
time, nor the place. Try submitting your URL to a few search engines 
(like YAHOO and EXITE). Then, anyone looking for a page on whatever 
subject yours is on will find yours. Doesn't the fact that no one is 
going to your page tell you something (like it isn't working to post 
it here)? At any rate, thank you for responding to my message, it 
does at least confirm that there are a few with at least some brains. 
Closed minded, possibly small, but brains nonetheless.

      sincerely,
            the Hutt </pre>
