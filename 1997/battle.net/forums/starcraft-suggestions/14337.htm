<pre>I'm not that old, a while ago say November '96 I ran into this ultra 
cool game called MAGESTORM. Now that was a really cool game. One of 
the best that was ever made. It was a doom like game (first person 
perspective) now usually I hate these kinds of games, but this one 
was awesome. The point of the game was not to kill the other guy, but 
to take over his team's shrine. And you don't pick up weapons but ... 
Oh well I am sure you don't want to know about that. 

Anyway my point is that I played that game for three months, many had 
been playing for like eight, but the point is that, the game was 
never hacked, some how nobody ever found a way to hack the game, if 
you hack it, it would simply mess up on you.

I suggest Blizzard look towards something like that. I hate cheating, 
it ruins the fun of the game. I pourchased Diablo, I thaough it was a 
really cool game. Especially because you could actually battle other 
human characters (I disliked WarCraft because the computer was too 
easy and other human players sucked). Anyway now I think Diablo is a 
piece of shit simply because everybody is cheating!!!! I mean sure 
add a few point of health and it won't really matter to much, but 
these people are using invincibility, and can't be killed, that is 
too much for me. I will fight cheaters as along as I have a chance, 
as long as I can do some damage I am okay, but I will not fight if 
the other guy has invincibility on!

I guess all that I am saying is that cheating kills a game and if 
bizzard allows people to save, one of the thousands of hackers out 
there is going to hack the game and it will suck like the rest of 
them stupid miltiplayer games.

Another thing, you have to be careful that the players won't get a 
program like soft ice that edits your memory so that during a game 
the guy can't just add money to his game.</pre>
