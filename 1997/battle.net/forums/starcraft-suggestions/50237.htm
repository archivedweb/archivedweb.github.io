&#62; First the questions :D
&#62; 
&#62; If a Protoss &#34;High Templar&#34; mind controls a SCV, it capture 
&#62; it-right?
&#62; Then can the SCV build Terran structures under Protoss control?
&#62; 

Hm...no, I don't think the Protoss can't capture an SCV in this way.  
You can, however, set an SCV to to be captured in the map editor, 
then use it to build Terran structures.

&#62; Why can't Terran capture buildings? In X -Com humans(terrans) first 
&#62; don't understand
&#62; alien structures, but can research it, thus imparting alien knowledge 
&#62; to themselves.
&#62; Why can't the Terran do this in SC? Perhaps even Zerg buildings could 
&#62; be tamed.
&#62;

Different Terrans, different aliens :)

 
&#62; Are there multiperpose buildings? The &#34;Nydus Tunnel&#34; upgrades 
&#62; units, but can it
&#62; also serve as a hiiden means of transport?
&#62; 

Yes, many buildings perform more than one function.  The Protoss 
Pylon is an example of this.  Not only does the Pylon give the 
Protoss more supply, it extends the player's enegy web, allowing for 
further expansion.

&#62; Can units swich between weapons-like the &#34;Impaler&#34; Cannon 
&#62; might fired faster and more precisely than the grenade,
&#62; but the grenades do more damage and damage a lagre area.
&#62; 

That has been suggested in the past (it sounds pretty cool :), and I 
have forwarded it to the development team.

&#62; How smart is the AI?If a unit is being shot by something he/she/it 
&#62; cannot see
&#62; (i.e. weapon range longer than sight range), what will the unit being 
&#62; shot at do?
&#62; In TA they first flee if they are alone,or they group with teamates 
&#62; and charge at whoever/whatever 
&#62; that is shooting at them.
&#62; Of course, they will fight to the death if you given them orders not 
&#62; to use their AI.
&#62; 

Different units will do different things.  I'll see what details I 
can find out, however.

&#62; Now the suggestion:
&#62; 
&#62; Can't defences be abit stronger?In TA they are very strong-like with 
&#62; equal cash, you could make
&#62; a better defence than offensive troops.Really stops tank rushing-does 
&#62; not stalemate the game 'cause
&#62; artillary have father range than defences-but artillary have their 
&#62; own weaknesses.
&#62;

Rest assured, each race will have it's own ways to break an oncoming 
attack, though very strong defenses will not be so easily made as to 
keep games going forever :)
