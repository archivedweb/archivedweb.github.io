&#62; If starcraft has sound like war2, i won't buy it.  Don't give me crap 
&#62; about missing out on a really cool game, cuz in my humble opinion 
&#62; Blizzard doesn't know a thing about making a good game... Take 
&#62; Diablo, after an hour it was boring, i mean, there was nothing too it.
&#62; Click, click, click and click again.  
&#62; 
War2's sound effects were the one of the best parts of the game. if 
you 
were bored, you could just click a unit a lot and listen to what it 
said. And 
if you didn't like the sound, you could shut it off or try to make 
something
better (it came with a sound effects editor). Most people don't even 
care
about the sound. If you want annoying sound, try AoE. All the units 
in that
game only say about 2 or 3 things, and are completly unintelible. Most
people just want to go in and replace it with war2 sounds. Anyone who
complains about war2's sound effects should obviously not even have a 
computer int he first place, since any idiot can shut the sounds off.

&#62; Another thing about Starcrap... What kinda game has no release date?  
&#62; I know Blizzard is a new company, and that they are still learning 
&#62; their way around, but no release date?  gimme a break...
&#62; Blizz is trying to avoid having gamers gripe about a missed release 
&#62; date, so they just don't have one...  so, in trying to avoid one prob 
&#62; they now have another.  Instead of ppl complaining about a missed 
&#62; release date they have ppl complaining cuz there is no release date.

OK, you go make a game and give it a release date, and make it a
good game. Can't even make a game? Can't even find anything
better to do than complain? Who has the problem, Blizzard or the
impatient people with nothing to do but wait for a game they don't
like because they are impatient?

&#62; One more thing, I heard from a reliable source that Starcraft isn't 
&#62; coming out until March...  oh well... Here we go again!!

Sorry, the little voices in your head don't count as reliable sources.</pre>
