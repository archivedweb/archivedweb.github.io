&#62; Here it goes:
&#62; 
&#62; Neither in Red Alert, Command And Conquer or Warcraft II, you have 
&#62; been able to play on maps with REAL cliffs, mountains and valleys!
&#62; The only thing that existed in War2 was the damn &#34;mountains&#34;, 
&#62; but I cant really call these &#34;stones&#34; mountains...I really 
&#62; can't.
&#62; 
&#62; Why not stop making these STUPID FLAT maps, that existed in
&#62; Red lert and War2??? Why not make REAL mountains And REAL
&#62; valleys???
&#62; 
&#62; Imagine: A base settled high above the ground, on the top of a 
&#62; mountain, or, a base settled in a huge valley, with two rivers 
&#62; protecting it....
&#62; 
&#62; That would IMPROVE THE GAME-PLAY, &#34;TRUST&#34; ME!!!!
&#62;

It's a great idea, but think about this for just a second.  This is a 
space battle game -- Blizzard is not dealing with the simplicity of 
creating a flat landscape with the 3-D wrinkles you have suggested.  
If Blizzard adds the third dimension to this game, it would have to 
be included in all aspects (not just attack, but also travel, base 
building, and resource gathering).  This would complicate the game's 
creation exponentially.  If there is a third dimension, you have to 
give the player the option of using it, which would mean re-creating 
the game and graphics engine.  I do not think we want to wait three 
more years for the game to come out.

If, however, you mean to limit the use of depth to ground battles on 
the planets, or meteors, or whatever the hell we are building on, 
this would be a nice addition.  Your mountain idea would have easily 
enhanced the gameplay of the 2-D games that you have mentioned.
