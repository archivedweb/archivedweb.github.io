<pre>Well here is what I mean. Anyone seen the past issue of both CGW and 
PCgamer? Well in the past CGW there was the RTS rundown which had two 
page article on SC. (First place so it got two pages) There was very 
little new info, if any. There was also a two pae add. Nothing that 
we did not know and those screen shots were VERY old. In fact that 
add had been in magazines for awhile. In PCgamer, (the most recent) I 
was not just disappointed at the absence of any SC new other than the 
add but at the whole issue!!! It claims it is the biggest issue 
ever...well I believe it! They must have put 1.5 times more adds!!! I 
personally saw very little I liked in the issue... even with the 
DukeForver &#34;exclusive&#34;. (Although that may have something to 
do with the fact that I do not like first person shooters.) So 
blizzard...if you read this... What is up? Have you simply not 
invited the magazins within your hollowed halls... or are they losing 
interest. That would not make sense since SC just won first place in 
the CGW RTS rundown. From this I am gathering that SC will NOT be out 
in November. (Although there are other factors...like beta testing 
takes 2-4 weeks and then they have to fix the bugs then ship it.) I 
would say it will come out December...9th.. why December 9th. Well 
ummm you see. That us assume that it takes 1 more week for beta to 
come out, (OCT 29) then let us assume that test takes the full 4 
weeks (round to NOV 29) They take...3 days to fix the last bugs. 
(Does November have 31 or 30 days.. DEC1) Then it takes a week to 
copy and ship the CDs. (DEC8) Stores have it on the shelf next day. 
(DEC9) Oh yeah... not to mention DEC9 is my birthday... YAAY SC comes 
out on my Birthday. ;)
