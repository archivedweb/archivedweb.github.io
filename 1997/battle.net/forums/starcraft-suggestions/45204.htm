&#62; If war2 had just came out, more people would be still playing it.  
&#62; What
&#62; we are all suffering from is called war2 burn out.  Its like coming 
&#62; off
&#62; the rebound with a woman.  You go for just about the first thing 
&#62; available.
&#62; :)

I might be wrong but Total Annihalition, Dark Reign, Conquest Earth, 
War Wind and a whole bundle of RTS games came out before AoE...Did I 
go for the first thing available...Nope....I went for a winner...

&#62; 
&#62; Maybe so, but the tribes are all the same, its just some dont get
&#62; certain units, buildings, or upgrades. But as you say, they do all 
&#62; have
&#62; differenct special skills.
&#62; 
&#62; Starcraft on the other hand has three *DIFFERENT* races, they dont 
&#62; look
&#62; the same, or even play the same.

Well, I have to tell you....not many of the tribes on AoE play the 
same.....Granted most the units look alike, but the buildings do not. 
 Each geographical region represented in the game has a distinct look.

&#62; 
&#62; They are discussing random maps, and starcraft supposedly already has
&#62; quite a few map types.

Hmmm...I like how they are &#34;discussing&#34; random maps and 
&#34;supposedly&#34; already has quite a few map types.  Makes me 
feel confident in buying their game.
 

&#62; 
&#62; thats cause you dont need them all, with a 50 unit cap, you aren't 
&#62; going
&#62; to use a lot of the units &#60;but then again, it depends who's 
&#62; playing&#62;.

Ah, you don't need all of them, but they are there depending on what 
strategy you are going to take.  If you are doing an island pud, 
there are alot of upgrades you won't use or will use late in the 
game, but there are a compliment of upgrades that will help you in 
that island game.  Just the fact that so many options are there is 
what makes it unique.

&#62; 
&#62; Master of orion 2 &#60;you didnt say it had to be RTs&#62;.
 
You know, when I go thru the drive thru at McDonalds, I don't say, 
&#34;Hey, could you put my food in a bag?&#34;.  But every damn time 
they give me my food in a bag..........


&#62; Thats the one argument i actually agree with, Starcraft is not out.
&#62; If you need a game NOW then get aoe, but often the best experiences
&#62; take the longest time to attain.
&#62; 

Exactly, that's why I waited thru the releases of Dark Reign, 
Conquest Earth, M.A.X., War Wind, Total Annilhalation, Dark Colony, 
etc. until a good RTS came out.  AoE is IT...

&#62; Index
&#62; - why do people keep asking us to get other games, could it be that
&#62;   that they are tired of playing alone? &#60;hehehe j/k&#62;

Mr. Softy
-Why do people waste their time in forums for games that won't be 
released for months, when they could be doing some serious 
gaming...Hey, what am I doing here?  :)</pre>
