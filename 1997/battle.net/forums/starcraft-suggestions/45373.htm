&#62; Some people love these games. Possible you don't, but people have

&#62; they're good at&#34; - I hear you say. Yes, I agree, but how do you 
&#62; know that they're not good at other game styles? And I can't believe 
&#62; that you said that RPG's don't last long! You're wrong there dude! 
&#62; Possibly that you got a good character in Diablo quite fast, though, 
&#62; your character can still get better, I'm sure of that. Though I agree 
&#62; with that RTS games have longer durability, but RPG's are not far 
&#62; away.. so you want every gamecompany in the whole world to make only 
&#62; RTS's? Wow, then those games would get fun after 20 years..
&#62; So stop this bullshit saying they should do no more than RTS's!
&#62; And how do you explain that people still play Angband from 1984? (RPG 
&#62; with no graphics at all)
&#62; How do you explain that MUDs are welcome by many? How do you explain 
&#62; that Diablo sold in 13 million ex? (Think it was 13 million, and just 
&#62; imagine how many piracy versions that's out there..) Why do you think 
&#62; people are waiting for Diablo 2? That's cause they want those games, 
&#62; so stop this nonsense! You want RTS games? Fine, then buy those and 
&#62; leave the other games alone if you like..

Most of us fans of Blizzard are fans of their RTS games. Not many of 
us RTS fans like adventure games. You mean RPGs have almost as long 
lastability as RTSs? No way. How many times can you kill Diablo 
without getting bored? When I play, people just go straight to hell, 
skipping the other 3/4 of the game. Diablo seems so easy for many 
people who have built up their characters too well, or for all those 
cheaters with god mode. Think about this. When you reach level 40, 
it's gonna require HEAPS of exp. to get better, and when you do get 
better, all you gain is 5 points to distribute. Wow. Not like your 
character isn't already good. I can quite confidently say that 
Blizzard has given up with Diablo. They have made several update 
patches to fight against cheating, but a day after each release, new 
cheats appear all over the net and they are spread around quite 
quickly. They have completely stopped at v1.04 half a year ago 
because they knew if they updated it again, there would be more 
cheats. This I guarantee will happen to Diablo 2. And if Blizzard 
hasn't given up, why haven't they still fixed up that duplication 
bug? Another reason why diablo sucked: Don't you ever get bored of 
being killed by another player who has God mode on? You go and chop 
him back with your kick ass character, then you see that he has 
20000000 HP. Also he doesn't get hit. People with god mode slaughter 
computer monsters without taking damage. What fun is that? Play with 
a few other people. Walk into a room full of monsters. Then you see 
all this apocalypse going on. All the monsters are constantly being 
apocalypsed (by an AAA staff). He gets all the exp. for the kills, 
all you do is stand there and watch them helplessly die. What fun is 
that? Just about every cheater (99&#37;) on battle.net have AAA, 
GPOW, KSOH, and stormshields. There you go. You have 4 players 
against the computer, and none of you can die since you all have such 
good stuff. Multiplayer is far too short. Skipping straight to hell? 
No minor quests? All quests are just about killing all the monsters. 
There are no puzzles or anything like that. That just proves how 
crappy Blizzard is at making any game other than an RTS.

And as for the 13 million who bought Diablo, I think half of them 
have regretted their decision. Most of us qould realise Diablo does 
not have long replayability. How long have YOU been playing Diablo? 
If you got it at the start of the year, you COULDN'T be still playing 
it right now could you? Diablo expansion pack? How crappy. 8 extra 
levels of dungeon. 1 extra hero class. Diablo only had 16 levels, it 
took me 2 days to finish in single player. 8 levels should take me 1 
day only. There waste of money. All finished in 1 day. Battle.net 
won't even have multiplayer support for the expansion pack so it has 
basically no replayability at all. You don't want to pay for a game 
which you only play for 1 day do you?

As for WA, what is the element of a good adventure game? Sense of 
humor. Does a warcraft storyline look like it will give WA a lot of 
humor? I don't think so. It's all about some orc imprisoned who must 
free himself and unite the orcish clans whatever blah blah blah.. It 
looks like quite a serious quest, leaving not much room for humor. 
How dull. The main reason why UI don't want them to make this game is 
because I'd rather they spent their time on something else. You say 
that they are making more money by making other games instead of RTS, 
well do you really think that they would make more money selling an 
adventure game than they would selling another RTS? If they were to 
make both warcraft 3 and WA, which game do you think would make 
blizzard more money? Of course war3, no one plays stupid adventure 
games which last one week. Point and click piece of shit. Pick up 
vase. Wow!!! I picked up the vase!!! Awesome. Use key on door. Hey it 
opens!!!! How amusing.

Order orc to slash human's corpse. Now this I find more fun than 
opening doors. Fire cannon at peasant. This is also more fun than 
walking around, picking stuff up.

What tends to happen with adventure games? A walkthru is spread 
around over the net and everyone who hasn't finished it will. End of 
game. If you want to waste your money on a short lived game, go ahead.

Adventure game from Blizzard? I rest my case.</pre>
