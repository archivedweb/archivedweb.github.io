  Technically speaking, I guess you'd have to call that more a 'cheat 
that lets you screw over other players in multiplayer games' than a 
hack. The effect is pretty much the same, though.

&#62;   Forumers,
&#62; 
&#62;   Well, over at the TA forum, they've got a guy by the named of 
&#62; Dataman, who offers this advice on how to 'edit' TA units to your 
&#62; liking:
&#62; 
&#62;    I figured out how to change the parameters for all the units in 
&#62; TA. I'm working on a program to do this a lot easier as well as
&#62;     an actual FAQ... I wanted to get this info out so others
&#62;     can begin work on some editors):
&#62; 
&#62;     - The files to work with are the *.ufo files (the unit
&#62;     files)
&#62; 
&#62;     - Know what the current values are for each unit (I use
&#62;     the Unit Viewer for an easy reference for most
&#62;     variables)
&#62; 
&#62;     - You can figure out which .ufo file is which unit by
&#62;     the name of the file: Armbrtha.ufo is the Arm's Big
&#62;     Bertha for example.
&#62; 
&#62;     - Use these formulas to figure out the values in the
&#62;     .ufo file:
&#62;     Cost Energy: (value/4)+255 = result - value = X
&#62;     Cost Metal: (value/3)+255 = result - value = Y
&#62;     Time: (value/2)+255 = result - value = Z
&#62; 
&#62;     (some units:)
&#62;     Max Velocity: (value*4)= result - value = A
&#62;     Max Acceleration: same
&#62;     Turn Rate: same
&#62; 
&#62;     Yes, you will get negative numbers.
&#62; 
&#62;     - Take each result from above (X,Y,Z,A) and search for
&#62;     their DECIMAL (float) value in the proper .ufo file.
&#62;     When you find the location, note it for that unit (I'm
&#62;     working on a complete list of offsets) and now you can
&#62;     change the values (remember to do the opposite with the
&#62;     formulas to check the value).
&#62; 
&#62;     This has worked wonders in a multiplayer map where I set
&#62;     the Big Bertha to be only 1 Energy, 1 Metal and 1 Cost.
&#62;     I had 30 of them pounding my enemy!!!
&#62;     (there are actually good uses for this method of
&#62;     changing units...)
&#62; 
&#62;     Also, I'm trying to figure out how to name your own
&#62;     units... I think I might be a few days from that.
&#62; 
&#62;     In the future: Weapons and the rest of the parameters.
&#62; 
&#62;     It literally took me over 60 hours to figure this out...
&#62;     a lot of trial and error. I recommend you backup your
&#62;     files BEFORE messing with anything!! (unless you don't
&#62;     mind reinstalling)
&#62; 
&#62;     Works great in having a Big Birtha cost 1 energy, 1
&#62;     metal and 1 time...:) (yes, works in multiplay)
&#62; 
&#62;     D@t@m@n
&#62;     tHe UlTiMaTe HaCkEr
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;   He also says elsewhere that the .ufo files are loaded with the unit 
&#62; viewer, and that the ufo files are to be put in the Main Directory of 
&#62; the game on your Hard Drive-- that's the only place it'll work.
&#62; 
&#62;   I do not OWN Total Annihilation, so I don't know if this'll work, 
&#62; but anyone here who does, please try it and let us know if it does.
&#62; 
&#62;   I guess if it does work, Cavedog is going to have to scramble to 
&#62; write a patch to stop it. It's kinda funny...I remember some TAer 
&#62; going off on how Diablo was so easy to hack :)
