   Lately I have been away from this forum (because of a server 
problem and I have gotten back into the game Subspace [if anyone 
cares, my screen name is ssaamm in subspace, look me up or something, 
haha]) and when I came back, I was repulsed by what I saw.  After 
scanning through the messages, I saw one from SOMMS (no, don't hit 
your back button!  I am not flaming SOMMS :) ) and then a reply from 
Iolaus.  The bulk of SOMMS message was reassuring Pyran Firebrand 
that Lord of the Clans won't interfere with Starcraft.  It was a very 
polite, courteous reply, utilizing no bad language or grammar :)  
THEN,, I read the reply from Iolaus, and was absolutely MOTIVATED to 
write this.  Iolaus replied by saying &#34;finally trying to act 
civilized, eh?  Not cussing or making your-momma jokes, trying to act 
mature&#34; (NO, this is not completely accurate, but a fair 
representation :) ) 
    How PATHETIC!!  You people flaming SOMMS for everything he does 
are PITIFUL!  The guy is trying to apologize, trying to be civil, and 
you ASSHOLES are going to go off on him like a bunch of idiots!  
Everytime SOMMS rights something, someone replies with &#34;SOMMS 
sucks, or SOMMS is gay, or SOMMS is an asshole (Blizzard will 
probably vape me for my language, haha)&#34;  And then you have the 
AUDACITY to call SOMMS IMMATURE?!?!  If you insult him, you think he 
will keep being friendly, or start being friendly?  He will go back 
to cussing and fighting like he used to do!  He tries to be friendly, 
and we just keep insulting him, keep enraging him, and then when he 
finally blows up we say &#34;SEE? what did i tell you? SOMMS is 
pathetic.&#34;    Correct me if I'm wrong (can't wait to see the 
replies for that one!), but we are the pathetic ones.  Kicking him 
when he's down.




     That is about all I have to say, I would welcome any criticism 
or complaints or fights against me, I probably sound like I am 
whining, too.
