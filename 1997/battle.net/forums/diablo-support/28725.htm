<pre>I have seen almost identical effects.  All i can say is i'm running 
1.0 till 1.5 comes out.  Bilzzard has really dropped the ball on this 
one.  When i start a multiplayer game it's fine, but as soon as a 
second player joins (usually the second player gets a &#34;Cannot 
join game&#34; message) both screens freez up, and after a few 
seconds the screen turns black.  There are NO error messages, i am on 
a lan, it has worked fine in versions 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.  The 
computers are a P166, a P200, both with 64meg ram, and plenty of disk 
space, once in a while we tried with a P120 with 32meg ram, but that 
did exactly the same thing.  We have tried clean installs of windows, 
then diablo, then battle net to upgrade, and that did exactly the 
same thing.  Anything else you can suggest?  I'd really suggest 
tracking down the bug instead of this BS about it's your problem that 
i've been seeing here and through email.

&#62; &#62; After posting here several times, I tried sending a description of my

&#62; &#62; much like a &#34;canned&#34; reply, and I doubt that they bothered to 
&#62; &#62; read my problem report carefully.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Here is a shortened copy of my response.  My hope is that somebody at 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard will take the time to really read it and send an 
&#62; &#62; &#34;uncanned&#34; response.

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The 1.04 patch installs fine and runs perfectly in single-player 
&#62; &#62; mode.  As soon as I try to play any type of multiplayer game, 
&#62; &#62; (battle.net or IPX) I crash within 2 minutes.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Note:  I had NO multiplayer problems with v1.00 under the same system 
&#62; &#62; configuration. Why, why, why does the patch cause these problems to 
&#62; &#62; start?  Note:  I have repeated this process several times:
&#62; &#62;   Uninstall Diablo.
&#62; &#62;   Install 1.00.
&#62; &#62;   Play IPX multiplayer with no problem.
&#62; &#62;   Add 1.03 OR 1.04 patch.
&#62; &#62;   Crash, crash, crash.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I have tried manually installing the patch, and I have tried letting 
&#62; &#62; battle.net do the upgrade for me automatically.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; For what it's worth, I am NOT a novice computer user.  I am a senior 
&#62; &#62; software developer for an Internet company, and have an intimate 
&#62; &#62; understanding of Windows95/NT.  I've been meticulous in my efforts to 
&#62; &#62; try and solve this problem.  I've tried every suggestion that has 
&#62; &#62; been posted to the web tech support forum.  Nothing has worked.  I 
&#62; &#62; suspect that a bug was introduced in the patches - obviously a very 
&#62; &#62; subtle one that is sensitive to certain hardware configurations.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Would really appreciate some detailed feedback.  Even if Blizzard 
&#62; &#62; doesn't have an immediate solution, I would like to at least hear 
&#62; &#62; that you guys recognize this problem, and that it is being addressed. 
&#62; &#62;  There are lots of other users like me who have posted messages 
&#62; &#62; describing the same problem.  It seems that we are all getting the 
&#62; &#62; same &#34;canned&#34; response from Blizzard.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; --Pete
&#62; 
&#62; Pete,
&#62; 
&#62; The patches have made the game more demanding, and problems in RAM or 
&#62; devices may show themselves in the later versions of Diablo on some 
&#62; systems when they do not in the earlier versions.  
&#62; 
&#62; Can you repost here with your system specifications, a description of 
&#62; the crash you are getting (including when you receive it in the game, 
&#62; and a copy of the error message), and list what you have done to try 
&#62; to fix things?  We should be able to give you more detailed feedback 
&#62; when we have this information.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62; Pat N.
&#62; </pre>
