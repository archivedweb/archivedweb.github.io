yiliiu,

You are correct to assume that I do not help people who have problems 
created by third party programs.  I am not certain whether or not 
Diablo will work if you buy the retail version.  I do know that the 
shareware or spawn version and retail version are completely 
different.  They have no relation to one another and do not share 
files.  My only advice to you is to make sure you buy Diablo at a 
store with a good return policy.  One that will let you use the game 
for like 30 days and return it if your not satisfied.  Then, after 
you install the full version, I will be able to help you.  Keep the 
third party programs away from that version and we should not have a 
problem.  Blizzard will also help you with your problems , they will 
only do so during the times posted at the top of the forum.  I try 
and answer every question on the weekend if I can.  You can also e-
mail your questions to Blizzard support at

support@blizzard.com

I think Adam handles the e-mail.  In my opinion, I think you should 
not have a problem with the retail version.
