&#62; &#62; &#62; Try this,
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Uninstall Battle.net not Diablo from My Computer - Control Panel - 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Add/Remove Programs - Battle.net and remove.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Go to your Diablo folder and make sure the file BNCACHE.DAT is gone, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; if its still there delete it.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Delete the contents of your Windows Temp folder
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Before you log onto the internet if your playing on Battle.net and 
&#62; &#62; &#62; before starting Diablo, hit ctrl+alt+del and end task on all programs 
&#62; &#62; &#62; except for Explorer and Systaray.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Then try Diablo again.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I hope this works for you,

&#62; &#62; It did not work for me. :(. when I start diablo, its ok, but when it 
&#62; &#62; gets as far as the flamming diablo, the problums start. The diablo 
&#62; &#62; sign is stroling down, and the 
&#62; &#62; botton letters are overlaping. I don't have the milleniam card 
&#62; &#62; thingie either. So, what do u think?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanx, 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;       Screwball
&#62; 
&#62; Before you play Diablo, set your display properties to 640x480 and 
&#62; 256 colors.  You also need to make sure you have the latest video 
&#62; drivers for whatever video card you have.  The FAQ at the top of the 
&#62; forum has links to a bunch of the different manufacturers sites.  Try 
&#62; changing your display settings first, if that does not work get the 
&#62; latest drivers, keep your display settings like that for 
&#62; troubleshooting purposes.
&#62; 
&#62; If Diablo crashed with some windows error message you need to follow 
&#62; the advice I gave you in the first message, you should follow that 
&#62; procedure if you ever get a windows error while playing Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; If after all this your display is still messed up, try using Direct X 
&#62; 2.0, it is on the Diablo CD, some systems work better with it, go 
&#62; figure.  I am sorry but I do not know how to install the Direct X 2.0 
&#62; drivers, there seems to be no documentation about it.
&#62; 
&#62; If that does not work, try direct X 3.0a, it is a little later 
&#62; version of Direct X, I am reaching here though, get that at

&#62; Look in the technical support section there under X-Wing vs Tie 
&#62; Fighter.

&#62; Hope this helps,

fix it, but I guess I was wrong. thanx for your help, helper. I guess 
u really can't call it &#34;Help&#34; though. sence it did not really 
work. I thought this was -=Technical Support=- ! Well, please right 
back to me. I would like to try sum new stuff, and need some more 
help if u got it. C-YA
