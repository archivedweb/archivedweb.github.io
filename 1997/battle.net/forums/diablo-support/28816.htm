<pre>I cannot believe the audacity of you to come into the tech support 
forum and complain to Blizzard about losing your inventory because 
you cheated.  Why in the world do you think Blizzard would spend one 
iota of time helping someone with some program that they did not 
develop.  If you use a cheat program, you are using a cheat program 
at your own risk.  If you wanted to know what the save game files 
were for the purposes of backing up, then you could of e-mailed 
blizzard and they would have told you.  I don't feel sorry for you 
for one second because you lost your inventory.  You should have 
known the risks before you went and cheated.  One more thing, if you 
for one second think a Blizzard employee made fun of a cheater, you 
have got a another thing coming.  It is clear in Blizzard policy that 
they do not care about any cheats except those that effect other 
players.  If you want to hack your character up to level 99, give 
yourself all the spells, hacked items, be able to carry a whole 
inventory in one spot, that just ruins the game for yourself.  It 
does make the game unstable and causes all kinds of problems, but 
they have no obligation to support that.  You better do a reality 
check before you come into this forum spouting that kind of stuff.
