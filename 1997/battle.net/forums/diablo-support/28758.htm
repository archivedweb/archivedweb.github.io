&#62; &#62; Hey HELPER --
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; THANKS! I really appreciate all the, uh, &#34;help&#34; you've been 
&#62; &#62; giving me.  Let's hope my last post was the last of it.  And I'm just 
&#62; &#62; curious: who ARE you?  You obviously don't work for BLizzard...  I 
&#62; &#62; sure as Hell hope they at least ship you all their Betas -- and 
&#62; &#62; retails for free...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Best,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; CJ
&#62; 
&#62; CJ,
&#62; 
&#62; I have been a computer programmer for about 5 years.  I am not a game 
&#62; programmer, I do business and scientific applications.  I am an 
&#62; independent contractor so I am my own boss.  I live in Texas, I am in 
&#62; my late 20's, I am married and currently have no children.
&#62; 
&#62; I have access to over 10 computers and 4 internet connections.  I 
&#62; only post to this forum on 2 of them.  I have been working with 
&#62; Windows 95 for about 4 months.  I have gained a lot of experience in 
&#62; my job helping novice computer users with computer problems.  That 
&#62; experience has helped me in this forum.  I have no affiliation with 
&#62; Blizzard whatsoever, except that I enjoy there games very much.  I 
&#62; have in the past been accused of being harsh with people.  I have 
&#62; made a concerted effort to handle myself like I was working for 
&#62; Blizzard.  I pattern my help efforts after Pat N of Blizzard tech 
&#62; support, if there is something that they will not post in the forum, 
&#62; I will not post it either.  
&#62; 
&#62; I learned everything I know about Diablo technical support from this 
&#62; forum, my own and my friends experiences with the game, and the Open 
&#62; Tech Support Forum on Battle.net.  I read every message on this forum 
&#62; at least once and sometimes twice.
&#62; 
&#62; I have been an avid gamer for about 20 years.  The first computer 
&#62; game I ever played was on my father's PDP-11, the game was called 
&#62; Super Star Trek (SST).  I have been hooked ever since.  I have a 3D0, 
&#62; a Sega Saturn and an Atari Jaguar.  I use the MPlayer service alot, 
&#62; and recommend it to everyone.  The games I currently play are Diablo, 
&#62; Dungeon Keeper, Fallen Haven and Multiplayer Quake.
&#62; 
&#62; I am addicted to the Internet.  I consider everyone on this forum a 
&#62; friend, but my associates are WARGASM, Brandus, Janna and of course 
&#62; Pat N. and Adam M. :)
&#62; 
&#62; The people at Blizzard Tech Support know my real name and e-mail 
&#62; address, so if they ever have anything to say about what I do they 
&#62; can contact me.  
&#62; 
&#62; Well, I am sure that is more than you wanted to hear, but hey, I am 
&#62; at work and bored.
