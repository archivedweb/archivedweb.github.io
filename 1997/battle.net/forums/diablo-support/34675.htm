<pre>Hail to thee

I got a Hercules Stingray 3D with 6Mb RAM and a big problem with it.
It has a Voodoo-Rush chipset and wenn i play in WIN95, lets say Jedi-
Knights or Xwing vs Tiefighter it runs absolutly smooth. But now 
comes the bad part: All 5 or 6 minutes it stocks for about 1 second, 
and that always 4 times. After that it runs smooth again, but after 5 
mins it start again. Try to catch a Tie-advanced with something like 
that. It only happens in Windows and since i bought that card. The 
service man from the store i bought it from said thats normal with 3D-
cards. Yeah, sure! I know lots of people with 3D-cards and they dont 
have that problems. He told me that Windows might load in the 
background but i dont see the busy-light on my PC lighting up when 
that happens. Then he said i should defrag my harddisks and i did, 
but it didnt get better. 

I would like to know if it is my 3D-card before i buy another card. 
Or maybe the card doesnt do so well with my AMD-K6 200 PC. Curse me i 
didnt buy a real Pentium 200 MMX. Does anyone else have probs with 
that card? And can anybody tell me a really good 3D-card with a 
Voodoo-chipset or something as good as that? A Monster-3D with a 2D-
card would be great combination i heard. Is that true?

Please post the answer here or mail me.

Thanx in advance

Andy/Nemesis</pre>
