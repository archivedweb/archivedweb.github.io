&#62; OK I will admit that I'm a complete computer idiot right off the bat. 
&#62; I can NOT find my computers name.  The problem is this--I am probably 
&#62; going to have to wipe my hard drive and start over due to various 
&#62; problems I am having with our new computer. I have sent an email to  
&#62; support@blizzard.com for instructions on how to back up my characters 
&#62; so that I don't lose them, however if I understand all the posts 
&#62; correctly this will do me no good if I don't know my computers name. 
&#62; I have tried My Computer, Control Panels, Identification-(there is no 
&#62; identification tab here).Also tried Network, View, Options-still no 
&#62; ident tab. All I get is configuration tab with the list of differnt 
&#62; types of connections and it says windows logon down in a lower box. I 
&#62; called compaq tech support to see if they could tell me where to find 
&#62; it & they didn't seem to know what I was talking about. The guy said 
&#62; the only way he could get an identification tab to come up was to go 
&#62; under networks and hit add and then choose a client. He said I didn't 
&#62; want to do this and that I should contact Blizzard or b.net so here I 
&#62; am. Should I be contacting flashnet for this? Are ya'll referring to 
&#62; my b.net account# ?? I know this is probably a very stupid question 
&#62; but it's driving me nuts and I really don't want to lose my 
&#62; characters.
&#62; 
&#62; Some basic info: 
&#62; Compaq Presario 4770
&#62; Windows 95
&#62; Flashnet
&#62; 
&#62; If you need more info than this please email me. All these problems 
&#62; with  the Presario sure makes my Mac look good.  

Don't worry! your not going crazy of anything :-)  Actually, you 
don't have a computer name right now.  In order to get a computer 
name, your computer manufacturer was correct, you would have to add a 
protocol so Windows 95 could install the network drivers.  I would 
wait for Blizzard's official responce to this message, but I believe 
all you need to do is follow the instructions that Blizzard sent you 
except for ignoring the identification part.  When you re format your 
hard-drive and re-install Windows 95, you just need to make sure you 
don't set up any network information.  You should then be able to 
restore your characters and they should be OK.  Good luck!</pre>
