&#62; Okay I'll tell you from the beginning. 1st last Saturday I bought 
&#62; DIABLO. Then Saturday, Sunday, and Monday I played Battle.net all day 
&#62; basically but only in the DUGEONS. 
&#62; 
&#62; Then on Tuesday morning I started play and I got a level hi enough 
&#62; level to go to the CATACOMBS. When I had entered I played like for 5 
&#62; to 10 minutes then all of a sudden DIABLO closed and like 5 seconds 
&#62; later a screen came up and said illegal operation: in DIABLO.EXE. Yep 
&#62; I know everyone knows them because there posted all around these 
&#62; pages.
&#62; 
&#62; Well I read all the messages on it and I tried everything &#34;The 
&#62; Helper&#34; and &#34;Blizzard Support&#34; says and nothing worked. I 
&#62; tried deleting the BNCACHE.DAT file that never worked. I tried 
&#62; unistalling Battle.net. I tried unistalling DIABLO. Then I had sent 
&#62; email to Blizzard tech-support they sent me back a list of crap to do 
&#62; I tried all and it still came up with the same &#34;IO&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62; This problems occurs in Moderm and on Battle.net games. In single 
&#62; player game I don't think this happens but I'm not sure because I 
&#62; haven't yet gotten to the CATACOMBS. 
&#62; 
&#62; Display: S3 ViRGE
&#62; 
&#62; Sound Card: AZT 2316/R Audio Driver
&#62; 
&#62; Windows Version: 4.00.950 B
&#62; 
&#62; System: Petium/166
&#62; 
&#62; RAM: 32
&#62; 
&#62; Modem: Supra Express 336i PnP
&#62;

&#62; 
&#62; One last thing DirectX 3.0. I installed it and when I do one of the 
&#62; drivers it updates causes another problem with DIABLO. Here goes the 
&#62; problem. I'll open up DIABLO then next theing I know is that a blue 
&#62; screen comes up. It looks like its in DOS based Windows is 
&#62; highlighted in Grey and the below a message says a fatal exception 
&#62; has occured 0E has occured @ 0028:c027542B in VxD VWIN32(04) + 
&#62; 00002AF7. The current application will be terminated. 
&#62; 
&#62; That is why I can't install DIRECTX 3.0. I had talked to Blizzard 
&#62; Tech-Support on Battle.net and they told me to get the newest DIRECTX 
&#62; because that's what might be causing the illegal operation so I had 
&#62; went and gotten DIRECTX 3.0a and tried it out the same problem had 
&#62; occured. Then I saw that DirectX 2.0 may work better with other 
&#62; computers so I had went and got that but I ran the program and I 
&#62; wasn't even sure if it installed it or not. If it did instal it it 
&#62; didn't help anyways becuase I still got the same problem. 
&#62; 
&#62; Well if you can help me I am open to many and I mean many suggestions 
&#62; if you can email do so okay GOOD LUCK.

Identical problem here. Different sound card and video. Noticed you 
have OSR2. Did you upgrade to OSR2, or did you install it fresh? This 
might be a common thread to all these problems. 1.04 might be 
incompatible with OSR2. 

After installing the sound blaster drivers, I can't use mplayer.exe 
any more. Keep getting Kernal 32 errors. I have been trying all of 
these suggestions for over a week, and have had no luck. 

I cannot play single player, either. I am going to try version 1.0, 
when I get home tonight, to see if that proves that 1.04 is the 
culprit.</pre>
