<pre>1. More than once this has occured to me. As I am fighting the 
creatures inside Laz's Den, I have been killed when Mana Shield
is up and health is full, by a single fireball. Now this isn't that 
wierd, BUT, when I restart in town, I haven't lost the equipment that 
was on my person.  This is very odd, no?

2. This particular glitch has caused me too lose my equipment more 
than once as well. Once, I went back down through my own town portal
which was on lvl 15, and instead of coming out where I has left it,
I had appeared in a totally different room (surrounded of course).
I died in that spot and could not hack my way through the layers of 
creatures to reach my equipment.
    Then, more recently, as I emerged from my portal onto lvl 15, I 
immediately right clicked in order to teleport away only about 40 
feet, no more. Unfortunately, I didn't end up 40 feet away, but 4000 
feet away, totally on the other side of the level. Again I died and 
this time again could not hack my way all the way thru the level.

Can you explain why this happens?

on the side, I was wondering if it is possible to FIND items that 
have 
the prefixes that Wirt sometimes offfers? Merciless, Godly etc..


Thank you for this great game! (and a response to this I hope  *grin*)</pre>
