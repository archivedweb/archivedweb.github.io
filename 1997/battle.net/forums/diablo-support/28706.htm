&#62; I posted a question couple of posts below concerning GPOW and I got 
&#62; the &#34;USUAL&#34; answer i.e. keep looking, however, I didn't ask 
&#62; what are my chances to dfind it, I pointed on class of items 
&#62; impossible to find! Those which are sold by wirt. If we look at 
&#62; modern GPOW's and rest of godly plates, we can notice one STRANGE 
&#62; detail, it has ONLY plus to HP or Osmosis or Ages suffixes. Those are 
&#62; ONLY ones which are supported by Wirt for armors, I saw about 6 
&#62; different kinds of Godly plate of the whales, and I never heard of 
&#62; Godly plate of Gigants or Sorcery or Anything else for that matter! 
&#62; Let me assure you that I found MUCH more items with suffix &#34;of 
&#62; sorcery&#34; then anything of the whales! That can let us track items 
&#62; right back to Wirt. About cost of GPOW, It's 240,000 gold pieces. At 
&#62; least Griswold when offers a 1/4 of price offers over 60,000 for it. 
&#62; I know it's possible to buy Godly plate of the whales in form of 
&#62; breast plate, however It's absolutely impossible to buy anything 
&#62; godly with ac over 50! Holy plate with ac 43 cost 133000! Once again, 
&#62; we are talking NOT about single Godly plate, but about absence of a 
&#62; CLASS of suffixes/prefixes in dungeon. For example &#34;Wierd&#34; 
&#62; this prefix is fairly weak, it has same to hit with &#34;King's&#34; 
&#62; but lack damage, why is it SO rare? In fact it's same rare with GPOW 
&#62; to find! Or Ruthless,..... if number of Savage bows/number of Massive 
&#62; bows = number of Ruthless bows/number of Savage bows found in Dungeon 
&#62; I should at least found 15 of them with EACH character! I found like 
&#62; 100 Awesome armors ranging from rags to full plates, YET I never 
&#62; found ANY SINGLE piece of HOLY armor! Leave alone Godly. Are you 
&#62; saying that Godly plates can be only found along with suffix of 
&#62; Whales? I would ask you please check it with creators of the game. I 
&#62; know it may sound non important to you, but once again, it's a great 
&#62; deal of Importance to us gamers!</pre>
