<pre>There are shields of blocking, however, blocking is NOT rare! I's 
very common! Look at wirt when you just begin a game, he and grizwold 
sell hadfull of bucklers of blocking and even small shields of 
blocking! I suspect that if you ID every shield on Hell/Church you 
will eventually find Shield of blocking. It's just a LOW level 
suffix. Now there are several suffixes and prefixes which are fairly 
common at beginning but NONexistent later on:
of the Bear
Leech
Bat
Blocking
Bronze
Iron
Quickness
Readiness
Stability
Quality
Thorns
etc.
It sure would sucks to find something like Bronse Bastard's sword at 
Hell/Hell but I think that Godly shield of blocking would be NICE.. 
anyway, Search in Hell/church or create lowlevel character! As about 
Bows, Bows of haste DO NOT EXIST PERIOD.... I can tell you more, bows 
of speed do not exist as well... best prefixes you can get which 
increase speed of attack with bows are: Readiness and Swiftness, so 
it would be Strange bow of Swiftness(my dream) which as youc an guess 
VERY difficult to buy! Almost impossible... see there is a very short 
levels span when Wirt offers you specific suffix-prefix then after 
about level 30 he starts to offer you TOP (at his opinion) 
suffixes/prefixes only! Now, swiftness is a LOW suffix while Strange 
is a TOP prefix, you need a character high level enough to buy Items 
with Strange prefix, but low enough so he is still offered 
Swiftness.... If anybody bothers and makes a list of 
suffixes/prefixes and levels on which they offered, it would sure 
help! Yes I owned two bows of swiftness and like 3 bows of 
readiness.... but I prefer them Needler, never mind damage, I liked 
+50 to hit.</pre>
