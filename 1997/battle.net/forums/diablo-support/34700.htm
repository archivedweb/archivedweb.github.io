&#62; Hail to thee

&#62; I got a Hercules Stingray 3D with 6Mb RAM and a big problem with it.
&#62; It has a Voodoo-Rush chipset and wenn i play in WIN95, lets say Jedi-
&#62; Knights or Xwing vs Tiefighter it runs absolutly smooth. But now 
&#62; comes the bad part: All 5 or 6 minutes it stocks for about 1 second, 
&#62; and that always 4 times. After that it runs smooth again, but after 5 
&#62; mins it start again. Try to catch a Tie-advanced with something like 
&#62; that. It only happens in Windows and since i bought that card. The 
&#62; service man from the store i bought it from said thats normal with 3D-
&#62; cards. Yeah, sure! I know lots of people with 3D-cards and they dont 
&#62; have that problems. He told me that Windows might load in the 
&#62; background but i dont see the busy-light on my PC lighting up when 
&#62; that happens. Then he said i should defrag my harddisks and i did, 
&#62; but it didnt get better. 
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to know if it is my 3D-card before i buy another card. 
&#62; Or maybe the card doesnt do so well with my AMD-K6 200 PC. Curse me i 
&#62; didnt buy a real Pentium 200 MMX. Does anyone else have probs with 
&#62; that card? And can anybody tell me a really good 3D-card with a 
&#62; Voodoo-chipset or something as good as that? A Monster-3D with a 2D-
&#62; card would be great combination i heard. Is that true?
&#62; 
&#62; Please post the answer here or mail me.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanx in advance

I have a Monster 3D with a Diamond Stealth 3D 3000 card.  I love 
it!!!  The only regret I have is that it is stuck with 4 meg of ram.  
I don't have any of the problems you are talking about.  Sounds like 
something is wrong elsewhere.  However, I don't have the two games 
you are talking about.  I have Mech Warrior II (voodoo version), 
glquake, hyperblade, tomb raider (voodoo version), and a few other 
games.  All of these seem to run perfectly.</pre>
