<pre>I have a lvl 43 mage and over the past week or so, I have had a 
couple of strange situations occur.  I was in Hell/Hell and found an 
enchanted sheild--something like ob shield of the tiger, a very nice 
shield for a warrior.  I put it next to Cain, went back to hell, 
found another enchanted sheild and brought it to Cain.  It had the 
same specs as the one I had already found.  Great.  When I put it on 
the ground, I got the &#34;duped item detected and destroyed&#34;  
message, and the new sheild was gone.  I was unhappy to say the least.

I was glad I was alone, because my guild frowns on duping and that 
message could have caused me problems.  But that is not all.  Today I 
was again in Hell/Hell solo, and on lvl 14 I found a Royal Circlet.  
Cool.  I wear a RC and know its value.  I was sure someone in my 
guild could use it.  On lvl 15, Red Vex dropped an unique crown.  Not 
good.  I picked it up and sure enough it was a Royal Circlet.  
Unbelievable.  Now what?  I thought a unique item was unique.  Should 
I not id it?  I didnt want to give it to someone and have that 
message appear when they were playing with it.  So, once I got to 
town, I took a chance.  I id'd the second RC from that game.  And 
threw them both on the ground . . . nothing.  I threw mine on the 
ground.  Nothing.  No message, no disappearing act.  Just 3, count 
'em, 3 RC's on the ground.  I took mine and one of the ones I found 
in the game, and left the other on the ground.

But I am still curious, what is up?  Is a unique unique to the 
particular game or not,and why is Diablo stealing my enchanted items 
which I assure you are not hacked?  I am using the latest patch to 
access b.net.  and look forward to your response.</pre>
