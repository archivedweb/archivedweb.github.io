<blockquote>
<pre>I have noticed several recurring themes and would like to post this
as an answer to some of them remember if you have questions after 
reading or are still confused Post a Question to BLIZZARD.  If you 
think some of this is wrong again ask BLIZZARD or please reply and
I will change it.

BLIZZARD's E-Mail is: Support@Blizzard.com 

1.  I dont know why Blizzard will not just post this in their FAQ 
because of the many cheats that are loose that mess peoples systems
up but here is how you transfer characters from one computer to 
another:

 Look in your windows dir and copy the file(s) dlinfo_*.drv (* is a 
wildcard) to diskette.  open MY COMPUTER select CONTROL PANEL select 
NETWORK select VIEW then OPTIONS then IDENTIFICATION and make sure 
that the name of the computer which you are transferring to is the 
same as that which you are transferring from, the computer name is 
case sensitive.  copy the dlinfo_*.drv to diskette then to the 
windows dir on the new computer.  
 To view hidden files select MY COMPUTER, click on VIEW, OPTIONS, 
VIEW, then select SHOW ALL FILES,  select OK. 

A WARNING: After u install Diablo on the new system be sure u upgrade 
the ver1.00  to ver1.04 due to problems of losing equipment during 
upgrade be sure to copy ur dlinfo_*.drv files AFTER u upgrade to 1.04

2. there is no secret COW LEVEL its a SNIPE HUNT

3. Duping is cheating

4. dont cheat using hacks it can only lead to unstable systems 
and possible viruses BLIZZARD will not support hacks.

5. Please dont SPAM I dont buy it in the grocery why 
would I want it here.

6. my working definition of cheating and hacking:  
Cheating is when you use an outside program to influence another 
program in a way unintended by the original author.  
restoring a backed up character if your game crashed on you 
in B.Net is not cheating but restoring just because you got 
your Butt Kicked is.  Hacking is creating outside programs to 
influence another program outside of its intended parameters.

7. you cannot change the name of your character nor transfer 
them from multi to single and vice versa without cheating.

8. Lvl 50 is the highest level.

9. shareware and full version are not compatable.

10. The lights next to your name on B.net represents computer 
lag green is good red is bad and the plug is the worst.  
In general how you see everyone elses lag is how your 
lag appears to them. If u see majority green then u have a good 
connection.   in chat type:      /rejoin       
sometimes this improves ur lag.

11. Read BLIZZARD's FAQ

12. A Snipe is a WWI bi-plane or a mythical animal

13. If your are having difficulties connecting to B.net using 
AOL you probably need to download their win 95 update.  Or 
better yet get a local service provider.   Look in your local 
yellow pages of your phone book for one.

14. If you are having problems with UDP packets getting proccessed 
you need to have ports 6112 open to get through your firewall. 
Contact 
your system operator for this if you dont know how or post 
Blizzard a note.

15. Diablo's plate, Map of the Stars, any gnarled root items 
not in club form,  any Demonspike Coat items not in the form 
of full plate mail, and Light Forge are hacked items.

16. You cannot send messages to someone in a game and there is 
no way to know what the password for a private game is unless 
they tell you first.

17. Goto  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ak/wargasm">http://www.angelfire.com/ak/wargasm</a>
for even more tech help ie. AOL and other such problems. its worth
visiting lotsa good tech info and links to more help.

18. Legit players pking is part of the game but god moders are not.
So if ur having trouble with cheaters talk to people for awhile and 
get to know them before starting a game.  Once u get to know people 
play private games.  It doesnt take long to find others to play with.

19. Dont expect help with your cheats, hacks and dupes in the OTS 
channel use them at ur own risk.  Because the people in OTS will
not help u and i doubt seriously Blizzard will extend support
to hack software.

20. If u are having problems with win nuke go back to the front page 
of this site and click on announcements, there are links to the
patches to stop winnuke there.

21. In B.net chat press F1 for general chat commands and help. 

22. private channel commands:
    /ban name            bans someone from private channels  
    /unban name          unbans someone from private channels
    /designate name      gives the hammer to whoever u choose 
    /resign              resigns ur right to the hammer


23. The colours of the character icons mean several things:
Grey = shareware
Gold = u have three dots and each dot represent one kill of diablo on 
       each difficulty level u merely have to be present on 16 when
       D dies to get a dot u dont even have to hit him.
The three other colours are just the colour for each class and have no
real meaning

24. If for some insane reason u insist on using cheats hacks or dupes
then any problems u have are urs alone     u will be left alone to 
solve them on ur own I nor most likely anyone in OTS or Blizzard will 
not help u with problems related to third party diablo software if it 
does not say ENDORSED BY BLIZZARD do not use this stuff in 
conjunction with diablo.  The only thing i will tell u is to 
uninstall diablo  uninstall B.net and reinstall deleteing all ur 
hacks and cheats before u reinstall.
    A Player by the Name of Ian posted a message complaining of 
corrupted character data the following is a reply by Adam of Blizz 
Tech Support in response to a post by Wargasm who was commenting on 
this poor losers problems with cheats   let Ian's foolishness be an 
example.

(The Original message Wargy is replying to is one by Ian who used 
cheats and hacks and screwed his characters up!!!  Blizz's response 
is at the bottom)

here... 
 &#62; now normally ppl who use hacks should burn in hell , etc etc 
preach 
 &#62; preach hehehe
 &#62; 
 &#62; how to solve it 
 &#62; goto <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ak/wargasm">http://www.angelfire.com/ak/wargasm</a> for how to back up 
your 
 &#62; character ,or transfer it to another pc  etc etc
 &#62; 
 &#62; put the chars in a different folder or floppy , delete the 
 &#62; dlinfo_#.drv in the windows folder , and then copy 
dlinfo_1.drv to 
 &#62; the windows folder start diablo , and check if u can access 
multi 
 &#62; play... if that works then u have one char back ... just 
repeat this 
 &#62; procedure , untill u stumble on the corrupt char file, that's 
the one 
 &#62; who needs be deleted , and if u still have chars left then u 
can 
 &#62; safely  copy them to windows...
 &#62; 
 &#62; i have the feeling that this plate will coz loads of troubles 
(i hope 
 &#62; hehehe) i allready met 8 sorry asses in OTS ... 
 &#62; yeah life is pretty good :)
 &#62; 
 &#62; Dangerous Toys
 &#62; aka WARGASM 

   Absolutely right in this case.  Deleting the effected character is 
   the only way you're going to get any of your characters back.  Be 
   carefull folks.  No cheats you see are created by us here at
   Blizzard and as such we cannot support their use, nor guarantee    
   _anything_ about them. I've heard of so many cases of people who
   got viruses through cheats or who lost all their characters, for
   warned is fore-armed, so be carefull.
