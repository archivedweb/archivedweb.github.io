<pre>first things first:

1. i was never complaining to blizzard.

2. i would never ask for, expect or use any help from blizzard.

3. blizzard has made a really great game. i dont fault them for that.

4. the reason i posted in here was to inform other users with the 
same    problem, not to have it out with people like you.

5. i am NOT 12 years old.

the entire reason i cheat is not to ruin the game for me or anyone 
else. it is because i want to enhance it. certain cheats dont affect 
game at all. i use these. here is a list of cheats that i currently 
use:

God mode from other players.

i use this, not to pk, but to prevent from being pk'ed. i know what 
your going to say, i've heard it from blizzard hundreds of times 
before: &#34;if you play with someone you know in private games you 
wouldn't need it.&#34; for me, private games violate the entire 
purpose of battle.net, as you are prevented from meeting people that 
you DON'T know and getting to know them and how they play. after all, 
how are you supposed to know  someone if you've never played with 
them before. None of my real life friends (yes i do have some) either 
can't play battle.net, or won't, so i find new friends online, 
through gaming. if you had taken the time to read my entire message, 
you would have noticed that my BROTHER used the inventory hack, not 
me. the simple fault that almost all 'pure' players is that this 
purism does not extend into real life: if they had found 100$ they 
would surely take it without a second thought, but in their controled 
world online, freebies are unheard of! how DARE another person use 
the equivilent of a get-rich-quick sceme! oh, and about your comment 
that if i had asked they would have told me. absoloutly no way. i 
have asked and asked again, but to the response that i didn't need to 
know. trust me, battle.net's time is up, and im not going to ever see 
you 'purists' again, as im not going to play UO. anyone who uses any 
program i make is free to change it as they like. if blizzard had 
included the cheats in the game like warcraft 2(which is the perfect 
solution, in my eyes, some cheats, but with no god mode), they 
wouldn't have half the problem with hacks as they do now. expect no 
more posts from me on this subject, but i will read responses.</pre>
