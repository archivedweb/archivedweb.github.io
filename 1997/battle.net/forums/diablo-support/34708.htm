<pre>I thought that UO was going to take me to a better place but 
unfortunately it has not.  I eagerly await Starcraft, Diablo 2 is too 
far in the future to even venture a guess.  I dont mind answering 
questions, and helping people, but I would much rather be playing a 
good game.  I have played Diablo to no end, Quaked it up forever, 
UO'd till I got burnt out, Dungeon Keepered the night away, and X-
wing vs Tie Fighter my way thru the night.  As soon as a game comes 
around that can take my spare time away, I still will lurk here.  The 
days of me answering every question are over.  There are no longer 
that many questions to answer.  When I first came here, it was me, 
WARGASM, Brandus and Support.  We were the regulars, and there were 
tons of questions, the little page numbers would be at 7 or 8.  I 
remember the time we answered every question on a weekend, we solved 
every one, followed up on each post back, hell I even called a guy 
long distance to fix his stuff over the phone.(he had a 800 number)  
Now there are more regulars and a lot less questions.  If there is a 
need for it, The Helper will be there, but now, there is not enough 
to go around.  Rest assured that I am lurking this page, for some 
reason I just cannot seem to get it off my computer, I have tried 
deleting bookmarks, everything, but nothing works.  We will just have 
to see what happens.

Bye for now,

The Helper
