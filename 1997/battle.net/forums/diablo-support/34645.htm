&#62; i couldn't even go into multiplayer games at all. i have been playing 
&#62; for months, so it isn't that my system wont play it. i tried 
&#62; reinstalling it and even trying to go into version 1.00 multiplayer 
&#62; and it wouldn't let me. please help if you can.

Ressell,

Lonara has some good advice, you should follow it.  Here is something 
else you can test, however:

When you reinstalled Diablo, did you erase your multiplayer 
characters?  Did you use any hacks or trainers on your characters.  A 
game crash upon selecting Multiplayer in the main Diablo menu screen 
can be caused by a corrupt character file (as Lonara mentions). 

  To test this, try installing the spanwned version of Diablo and 
using it to play a multiplayer game.  If the game does not crash when 
you select Multiplayer, then one or more of your characters may have 
been corrupted in some way.  If this is the case, you will have to 
delete the corrupt characters in order to play.  For help with this, 
please send email to support@blizzard.com.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
