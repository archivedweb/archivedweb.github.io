&#62; I have a lvl 43 mage and over the past week or so, I have had a 
&#62; couple of strange situations occur.  I was in Hell/Hell and found an 
&#62; enchanted sheild--something like ob shield of the tiger, a very nice 
&#62; shield for a warrior.  I put it next to Cain, went back to hell, 
&#62; found another enchanted sheild and brought it to Cain.  It had the 
&#62; same specs as the one I had already found.  Great.  When I put it on 
&#62; the ground, I got the &#34;duped item detected and destroyed&#34;  
&#62; message, and the new sheild was gone.  I was unhappy to say the least.
&#62; 
&#62; I was glad I was alone, because my guild frowns on duping and that 
&#62; message could have caused me problems.  But that is not all.  Today I 
&#62; was again in Hell/Hell solo, and on lvl 14 I found a Royal Circlet.  
&#62; Cool.  I wear a RC and know its value.  I was sure someone in my 
&#62; guild could use it.  On lvl 15, Red Vex dropped an unique crown.  Not 
&#62; good.  I picked it up and sure enough it was a Royal Circlet.  
&#62; Unbelievable.  Now what?  I thought a unique item was unique.  Should 
&#62; I not id it?  I didnt want to give it to someone and have that 
&#62; message appear when they were playing with it.  So, once I got to 
&#62; town, I took a chance.  I id'd the second RC from that game.  And 
&#62; threw them both on the ground . . . nothing.  I threw mine on the 
&#62; ground.  Nothing.  No message, no disappearing act.  Just 3, count 
&#62; 'em, 3 RC's on the ground.  I took mine and one of the ones I found 
&#62; in the game, and left the other on the ground.
&#62; 
&#62; But I am still curious, what is up?  Is a unique unique to the 
&#62; particular game or not,and why is Diablo stealing my enchanted items 
&#62; which I assure you are not hacked?  I am using the latest patch to 
&#62; access b.net.  and look forward to your response.

after killing lazarus and friends , i had the unique chance to pick 
up 3 stormshields..... :)
Have a nice legit day
