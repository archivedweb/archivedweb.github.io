<pre>&#62; No, Godly Plate (of the Whale, or otherwise) is not hacked from the 
&#62; single player game.  It is possible to find such armor in the 
&#62; dungeons of v1.04 of Diablo, though it is VERY rare.  If someone does 
&#62; have Godly plate, then they are either very lucky, or were given a 
&#62; hacked or duped item.

It is good to hear an &#34;official&#34; opinion. But I cannot help 
but point out the following things, which make me doubt that a Godly 
Plate (we speak about the &#34;big&#34; versions, i.e. AC 75 and a 
suffix like &#34;... of the whale) _really_ does exist in the 
multiplayer version:

- it is true that you can buy godly plate of the whale from wirt, I 
have seen it. But there _seems_ to be an upper limit to the price of 
the items Wirt offers, and it is at about 140.000 gold. If you 
extrapolate the price of a godly plate of the whale, AC75, from the 
amount of gold Griz offers for it, it has to be at over 200.000 gold. 
Even if Wirt would offer it (which he does not because of the upper 
limit), a player could never afford it, because the highest amount of 
gold a player can have in his inventory (while leaving six free slots 
for the plate itself) is 170.000 gold. Thus it is not possible to buy 
such a godly plate from Wirt.

- You state that it should be possible to _find_ such a plate in the 
dungeon. This implies that it is possible to find an item with the 
prefix &#34;godly&#34;. If you browse the Strategy forum regarding 
this subject and if you listen to Diablo players on battle.net from 
all over the world (as I did), you will learn that apparently _no_ 
player ever has _found_ an item with the prefix &#34;godly&#34;. You 
can buy godly items at Wirt's, all right - but finding one seems not 
to be supported by the multiplayer game. You state that godly items 
are very rare. It is possible to find items with the prefix 
&#34;awesome&#34; quite often - awesome shield of the tiger, awesome 
plate, awesome helm - no problem. Every player owns one. But even the 
prefix &#34;holy&#34; is nonexistent under the items one can find. 
Holy rags ? Not possible to find one. Godly rags ? Don't even think 
about finding some. Even a lowly godly cap with which Wirt annoys the 
player in every second game has ever been found by any player I know. 

What it want to say is this: Could it be possible that you _intended_ 
it to be possible to find holy/godly items in multiplayer diablo but 
that the &#34;randomizer&#34; which selects the items a player can 
find in the dungeon, well, shows some flaws ? Could you please check 
this and make sure that it _really_ is possible to find such items ? </pre>
