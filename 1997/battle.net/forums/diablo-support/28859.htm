Hi, yes....if you want to take a chance on a third party program, 
there is a way to move your character from single to multiplay and 
vice-versa.  The one I have seen has a limitattion though.  It only 
works with version 1.00 of Diablo.  You would have to reinstall 
version 1.00, transfer your character and then install the version 
1.04 patch.  Be advised that Blizzard will not support this program 
so if you encounter any problems to your character or your 
system...you're on your own :)

BTW - Level 38 is a high level for single player.  The highest level 
character I have seen in single player is level 30. :)

Good luck....

Sorry I can't remember the name of the web page this program exists 
on but if you search the many Diablo web pages out there you will 
find it.  Be advised that many will consider this cheating as there 
are many items which exist in single player which don't exist in 
multi.  If you play this character on BNET with some of those items 
you may be tagged a cheater and one of the purist, fundamentalists 
may end up PKing or as we said in Vietnam &#34;fragging&#34; you.  
Some do that to players they deem cheaters, so be careful who you 
play with :)
