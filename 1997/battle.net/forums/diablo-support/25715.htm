&#62; Hi Pat,
&#62; 
&#62; I think the problem I am having might be caused by the cable I am 
&#62; using.  It is a plain serial cable with a null modem adapter.  It 
&#62; works fine with Win95 DCC, Warcraft 2 and XvT.  Do I need to buy a 
&#62; null modem cable for Diablo to work, or should it work with the cable 
&#62; I am using?
&#62; 
&#62; I posted awhile back about problems I had with direct connection.  I 
&#62; had a problem with Diablo crashing as soon as I chose Direct 
&#62; Connection on either system.  Your advice was to check for IRQ 
&#62; conflicts.  Both systems had conflicts which have now been resolved.  
&#62; I'm having a different problem now.  I'm able to create a Direct 
&#62; Connect game on either system, but can't connect with the other 
&#62; system.  When I click retry connection on one system (with a direct 
&#62; connect game already running on the other system),  I get a message 
&#62; saying that no direct connect game was detected.  Here's info on the 
&#62; two systems.
&#62; 
&#62; Both are running Win95 w/Service pack 1, Kernel update and password 
&#62; update.  Both systems have different names.  Both systems have at 
&#62; least 400 MB of free HD space.
&#62; 
&#62; Packard Bell Pentium 120,  24 MB ram
&#62; Diamond Stealth 2000 (latest drivers installed)
&#62; Packard Bell Sound2 288SP sound card
&#62; modem on com1
&#62; serial cable on com2
&#62; 
&#62; The second system belongs to a friend.  The only thing I am not sure 
&#62; about is the sound card.  Under sound, video and game controllers in 
&#62; Device Manager, no sound card is listed; however, the sound on his 
&#62; system works fine in all programs including Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; Cyrix P150+, 32 MB ram
&#62; STB Lightspeed 128 (latest drivers installed)
&#62; unknown sound card
&#62; serial mouse on com3
&#62; serial cable on com4
&#62; 
&#62; Scott
&#62; 
&#62; ps:  Thanks for the quick reply on my last post.

I'm not Pat but if you don't mind, can I give it a shot?  You need to 
have a null modem cable to play direct connect with another computer 
with Diablo.

Both of the computers need to be the same version of Diablo.  You can 
check the version of Diablo in the choose type of game screen on 
Diablo startup, it will be at the bottom.  Both of the computers 
should be version 1.03, if they are not repost and I can help you 
more from there.

Hope this helps,

The Helper</pre>
