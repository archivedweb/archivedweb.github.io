&#62; I have been playing DIABLO since It was originally released.  I have
&#62; about 6 chars that are level 33 +  all are legit and have 3 dots..
&#62; 
&#62; What I want to know is...  Is there a reason for me to keep playing ??
&#62; 
&#62; I know this sounds like a strange question..  I like playing for the 
&#62; items,  its what keeps me going..  The hope that I will find 
&#62; something better than what I am using.   
&#62; 
&#62; Will I find better items than what I have ?  Example,  My rogue has 
&#62; eaglehorn&windforce ( are there kings bows ?)..   I have ac75 awesome 
&#62; plate (does holy/godly plate exist ?)..  
&#62; 
&#62; Keep in mind that i play only multi-player games (b.net)..  Throw me 
&#62; a 
&#62; bone..  tell me there is alot better stuff if i keep working at it.  
&#62; I would imagine at the point where I am, i am gonna need to find 
&#62; these things instead of buy them due to the fast they would cost more 
&#62; than could be bought  (the most $$ thing i have seen is in the 130k-
&#62; 140k range)
&#62; Princess-P     lvl 35 rogue - bored but trying not to be : )
Damn, please ignore that previous post.

In regards to your items.   I am currently a level 38 warrior also 
playing 100 &#37; legit.  I have not to date found any godly armor, 
but have found a godly helm.  I have not yet found any of the 
&#34;mythical&#34; Obsidian rings/amulets of the zodiac.  My advice 
is to keep playing, and hopefully the comradrie on bnet will keep you 
coming back even if you can't find any new items.
