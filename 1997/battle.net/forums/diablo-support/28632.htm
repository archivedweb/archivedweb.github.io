&#62; I've heard about a strategy guide for Diablo. Does it exist ?
&#62; Please, anyone reading this, help me... Give me the references, the 
&#62; exact title.. I've been looking for weeks for this guide.
&#62; Thanks for answering.

There are actually two Official Strategy Guides, a guide to Diablo 
and a guide to Battle.Net.

Diablo, The Offical Strategy Guide, by John Waters. Prima Publishing, 
ISBN: 7615-0371-4

That guide is...ok, though there is missing and erroneous 
information. The best part of the guide is probably the tables 
listing Unique items (some of which are missing), monsters, shrines, 
prefixes and suffixes etc. If you're having problems with the single 
player game, it will also give some decent tips (about the same as 
those you can find on the Web) about completing those quests.

I don't have the guide to battle.net, but did read it at a local 
Barnes & Nobles. It took about 20 minutes to skim it, as most of the 
information is repeated from the one listed above. From how it's 
written, it seems that the author didn't bother playing the Rogue or 
Sorcerer very much, and there are quite a few errors (e.g., he claims 
that Lazarus can't be stone cursed in multi-player...).

The first book might be worth having, though you can find most of the 
info online. I would recommend staying away from the guide to 
battle.net. Both of the books seems to assume that the reader is 
ignorant in general. Unlike most other strategy guides (e.g., the one 
for Master of Magic), the reader isn't &#34;burdened&#34; with 
formulas and numbers. You won't find a formula showing how the chance 
to hit a target is computed, and you won't find a good description of 
how resistance works. I'd like to know things like: how many points 
of dex does it take to increase damage and ac? How quickly do the 
monsters heal?

Blah, blah. Sorry to run on, but yes they do exist. You just may want 
to look them over *very closely* before spending any money on them.
