<pre>     Okay, here is my dilemma.  I start diablo, and I have to wait 
several seconds for it to boot up.  Fine.  But then my cd-rom light 
starts blinking and a whinny, high pitched sound comes from it (like 
the disc is spinning weird or something).  I know my cd-rom is fine 
because I use it for other applications as well.  Anyway, my computer 
seems to freez as this sound is being emitted.  Sometimes the sound 
will leave, and I can continue to select options and stuff.  But 
garaunteed this problem will occur again, and again it is as if my 
computer has frozen.  Sometimes it passes, other times I have to 
reset.  The worst is when it happens during battle.net or single 
player.  In a game, my computer screen will freeze, the music will 
loop around a certain point, and the whinny sound will come again 
accompanied by the damned blinking light.  Sometimes it passes, but 
mostly I have to restart.  Believe me, this is driving me MAD.
  The duration of this whinny freezing period is anywhere from 7 secs 
to 20 secs to infinity.  It makes me angry &#62;:[  Please give me a 
response that can help me.  I have tried the syscheck thing, and I e-
mailed you the results.  I tried the pc check thing at the diablo 
menu.  It returns that the cd-rom speed is anywhere from 60ms to 92ms 
to well over 300ms ...as an 6x CD-ROM should be.  Is the problem with 
the cd itself (as I think it is)?  PLEASE HELP ME OUT.  PLEASE 
RESPOND.  Arrrrrrgh.  It really is frustrating you know.
             Thank you for your time in reading this post.
                              --WidowMaker</pre>
