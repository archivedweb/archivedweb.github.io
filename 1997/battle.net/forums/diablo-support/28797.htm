&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Has anyone else experienced the following bug(s):
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; A) At times an item is dropped by a monster, then when one attempts
&#62; &#62; to pick it up, the itme does not respond (it remains on the ground). 
&#62; &#62; When it finally appears to to have been picked up, and one checks the 
&#62; &#62; inventory, it is not there.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; B) A monster drops some magical item. Because of other disptactions 
&#62; &#62; you are not able to pick the item up immediately, but proceed to 
&#62; &#62; slaughter some assailants. One of these dies right next to the afore 
&#62; &#62; mentioned magical item. And suddenly the magical item is
&#62; &#62; relaced by something else.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I usually play the game solo under IPX-multiplayer. All of these 
&#62; &#62; events 
&#62; &#62; occured several times, and the game did not crash soon there after 
&#62; &#62; (just to say that a memory malfunction etc is unlikely).
&#62; &#62; I am running the game on a P166, 24MB RAM, and plenty of disk space 
&#62; &#62; (100MB on C:\ and 700MB on D:\).
&#62; &#62; I have one of those Microsoft wheel-mice (intellipoint?) .
&#62; &#62; Further more, I disable all system extensions to remove any possible
&#62; &#62; conflicts.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; TO: BLIZZARD SUPPORT
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Have you heard of this before? Are you looking into a patch for this?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks.

It is a known *feature* of the game. :)

Tech Support is fully aware of this, they say it can be attributed to 
lag, but it can happen in solo games multiplayer games also.  The way 
to keep items from disappearing on you is to only click on the item 
once.  If you click on the item, and it does not get picked up, don't 
click on it again, just wait a little while and it should appear.  
Clicking on the item several times is almost certain to make it 
disappear.

P.S. This response is to the A part of the post, I don't know about 
the B part.</pre>
