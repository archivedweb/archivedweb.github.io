&#62; Helper,
&#62; Thanks for the email its been a help but didnt work. I do know now 
&#62; that it IS my multiplayer characters (got 2 of them). I've backed up 
&#62; my single and multiplayer characters and totally re-installed, 
&#62; including the 1.04 patch. It works fine. Then I put my single player 
&#62; characters back in, still works fine. THEN I put my multi-play 
&#62; characters in, same problem again, crashes when click on multi-player 
&#62; option. So I know its my multiplayer characters, what now? You said 
&#62; they should restore back to normal once I put them back in the win 
&#62; folder, they didnt restore, just stuffed the game up again.
&#62; Is there a way to fix my characters? Should I just give up and start 
&#62; over?!?!?
&#62; 
&#62; Blizzard Support,
&#62; Your email NEVER arrived, please send again or post response.

Aceman,

I am sorry if I mislead you.  My E-mail instructions were how to 
completely uninstall and reinstall, removing your characters, but 
saving them for a restore.  I did this so we could determine if it 
was your character files that were causing a problem.  When I said 
you could restore your characters to normal, I meant that you would 
be able to restore them in the exact same condition they were in 
before.  There was no character file filtering, there is no utility 
that allows that.  If we have determined that your multiplayer files 
are causing the crash, I suggest you start new characters and start 
over.  I am sorry that you would have to do this but I don't see any 
other way.  I would not recommend using 3rd party programs to restore 
your characters, but a post in Ogdens Tavern, to the attention of 
CodeMyster about your multiplayer character problems would not be a 
waste of time.
