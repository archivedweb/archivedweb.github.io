&#62; I really doubt it that they put those monsters and the other quests 
&#62; on the disc and did not intended
&#62; to use them. Ok, the monsters do occupy relatively a small place, but 
&#62; the quests are taking at least
&#62; another 50Mb. We're talking about 3 or more quests which each 
&#62; character and each towner has
&#62; it's own Waves regarding the quest, and I assume some more graphics. 
&#62; It would be very stupid
&#62; to put on the disc things who won't be used. If it's just junk - then 
&#62; they could have saved space,
&#62; time and money on creating every disc. You don't pay studio time for 
&#62; recording without any intention
&#62; to use your material.
&#62; 
&#62; See my point ?
&#62; And beside, some quests have a direct link to the story in the book.

ZZ,
     Go back and re-read my original reply to ur post  and im fairly 
sure that i said  Blizzard intended for the extra monsters and quest 
to be there but as t'kron and the helper (Whichever one)  stated   
and  as i also stated  that there were multiple reasons why blizz 
disabled them but left them in the code.   Go back and re-read my 
original statement and read the other posts to this thread  if ur 
still confused or do not believe us  then log onto to Bnet between 4-
6pm pacific weekdays and goto the blizzard tech support channel and 
ask the blizz folks themselves  im positive u will get the same 
answers we gave u as to why.

     Also i am certain blizz has plans to use that code in future 
games just because it is not used now doesnt mean it wont be used in 
the future.
