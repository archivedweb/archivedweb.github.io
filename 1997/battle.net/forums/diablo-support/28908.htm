&#62; Hi.
&#62; I've downloaded the last battle.net software, and I tryed to play 
&#62; diablo with it. I joined one channel, I played for a while with some 
&#62; other people, and after some minutes I was kicked out of the game, 
&#62; and found myself on the first screen of the battle.net to choose a 
&#62; channel again.
&#62; 
&#62;  Please tell me what can I do to play with others through Internet 
&#62; with battle.net.
&#62; 
&#62; thanks

Ilias,

The most probably reason for your being kicked out of a game can be 
attributed to your lag to that game.  If you play in low latency 
games (i.e. games in which your latency to the other players in that 
game is low), you should have much more success in staying in the 
game.

You can think of your latency to someone as your &#34;distance&#34; 
to them across the internet.  Latency is shown in the battle.net chat 
rooms as the green/yellow/red bars next to another player, or, in the 
join screen, as the green/yellow/red bars next to a public game.

If someone has just a few green bars next to their name, then they 
are &#34;close&#34; to you across the internet (i.e. your latency to 
them is &#34;low&#34;).  If you play in games with this person, you 
will have less lag and will be less likely to be dropped from the 
game.

If soneone has many red bars next to their name, then they are 
&#34;far&#34; from you across the internet (&#34;high&#34; latency).  
Games played with such people will have more lag, and you will be 
more likely to be dropped form the game.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
