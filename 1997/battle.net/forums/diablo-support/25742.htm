&#62; Hi Pat & Helper glad to see you are still around.
&#62; 
&#62; I posted a problem a couple of months ago re dropped lines in 
&#62; Battlenet games.  After a lot checking my system out I am totally 
&#62; happy there is nothing wrong with it.  What I have discovered is my 
&#62; ISP is consistantly dropping packets.  On average 20&#37;, but 
&#62; sometimes consecutively.  Latency is fairly good av 350ms.  But when 
&#62; it misses I get no response until a timeout after about 20sec.
&#62; 
&#62; Is this what is causing my problem?  Can I do anything about it?  I 
&#62; don't want to switch ISP as here in the UK in my experience the ISP 
&#62; is fast.  I use compuserve as well and they never drop packets but of 
&#62; course the latency is nearer 600ms average, sigh.
&#62; 
&#62; Any advice much appreciated. 

EasterEEL,

Sorry I can't advise you about your lost packets, since I don't work 
for Blizzard I am not privvy to the percentage of packets that have 
to get thru in order for you to play.  However, I get my most of my 
information from this forum and you can believe whatever Pat N. 
replies on this I will remember it.  Normally I would advise you to 
get a new ISP but since you are in the UK and I am in the US I have 
to take your word for it about UK ISP's.  Good luck and I hope you 
find the answer.  BTW, if you can get on to Battle.net you can go to 
the Open Tech Support Forum and ask about there, some knowledgable 
people hang out in that channel.
