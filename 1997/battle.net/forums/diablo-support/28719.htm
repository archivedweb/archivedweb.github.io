Pat,

It's always the same 2 people, I've not seen these symptoms
with other people, but I don't play with anyone else.  I've never
had these problems when laying over TCP/IP with people inside
the firewall, but I've not done that since v1.0.

Also, we've gone over their modem settings and they're as you
described below.

Other suggestions?

&#62; &#62; Hello,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I'm having the stangest problem when I attempt to play multiplayer 
&#62; &#62; games
&#62; &#62; over battle.net.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I usually play with 3 people. When anyone of us starts a game, one
&#62; &#62; player can join without a problem. The third player can then join, but
&#62; &#62; he is usually inivisble to the second player.  Occasionally the third
&#62; &#62; player can see chat messages from the second player, but they are not
&#62; &#62; associated with a name. That is, normally when you chat you see
&#62; &#62; something like:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; playerName (playerLevel 25): Hi there!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Well, what the third player sees from player 2 is:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; (Level 0): hi there!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; And player 2 cannot see player 3 at all.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Another symptom: We decided to play anyway, with myself being unable 
&#62; &#62; to see
&#62; &#62; player 2, and vice-versa.  We went into the Caves and I got killed.  
&#62; &#62; Player 1
&#62; &#62; ressurected me... but there were about 20 monsters right there and 
&#62; &#62; they killed
&#62; &#62; me again.  He (nor player 2) could see the 20 monsters that killed me 
&#62; &#62; twice, but 
&#62; &#62; I could see them, and they me, and so I could not be ressurected.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I find this all very strange. Also, occasionally, the third player
&#62; &#62; simply can not join the game.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Now, the mitigating cirumstance. I am behind a firewall. =) However, 
&#62; &#62; we
&#62; &#62; are proxying ports 116 and 118 (TCP) inbound and outbound, as well as
&#62; &#62; 6112 (UDP) inbound and outbound. The other players are not behind a
&#62; &#62; firewall.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Now, the question arises, are my problems due to my firewall? If they
&#62; &#62; are, then there must some other port that I need to open or proxy, 
&#62; &#62; and I
&#62; &#62; would appreciate it if you guys could let me know what that port might
&#62; &#62; be.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; If the problems are not related to the firewall, do you have any
&#62; &#62; suggestions as to what might be causing this, 'cause it's really 
&#62; &#62; ruining
&#62; &#62; my enjoyment of the game.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I had spoken to someone in the tech support chat room on Battle.net
&#62; &#62; before about the firewall, but he has yet to get back to me, and it's 
&#62; &#62; been over a week.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks for any help you can give!
&#62; &#62; Rob

&#62; Rob,
&#62; 
&#62; The porst you mentioned about are the only ones used to connect to 
&#62; battle.net and play games, so I don't think this is not a problem 
&#62; with your ports.
&#62; 
&#62; You say you usually play with 3 people -- are these the same people?  
&#62; If they are, then you should make sure that, if they are using a 
&#62; modem to dialup to their ISP, they have these modem settings:
&#62; 
&#62; Click on Start -- settings -- control panel
&#62; Open Modem
&#62; click on Modem
&#62; select properties
&#62; select the connection tab
&#62; select Advanced
&#62; make sure that Use Flow Control is selected and set it to Hardware
&#62; Turn on Error Control -- select Compress Data
&#62; Click OK
&#62; click on the Port Settings button
&#62; click on the default button
&#62; click OK
&#62; 
&#62; If you are playing with different people, then try to play with 
&#62; people with which you have a low latency (the kind of problem you are 
&#62; experience can happen in high latency games).  
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62; Pat N.</pre>
