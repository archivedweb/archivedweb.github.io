&#62; Hello,
&#62; 
&#62; I'm having the stangest problem when I attempt to play multiplayer 
&#62; games
&#62; over battle.net.
&#62; 
&#62; I usually play with 3 people. When anyone of us starts a game, one
&#62; player can join without a problem. The third player can then join, but
&#62; he is usually inivisble to the second player.  Occasionally the third
&#62; player can see chat messages from the second player, but they are not
&#62; associated with a name. That is, normally when you chat you see
&#62; something like:
&#62; 
&#62; playerName (playerLevel 25): Hi there!
&#62; 
&#62; Well, what the third player sees from player 2 is:
&#62; 
&#62; (Level 0): hi there!
&#62; 
&#62; And player 2 cannot see player 3 at all.
&#62; 
&#62; Another symptom: We decided to play anyway, with myself being unable 
&#62; to see
&#62; player 2, and vice-versa.  We went into the Caves and I got killed.  
&#62; Player 1
&#62; ressurected me... but there were about 20 monsters right there and 
&#62; they killed
&#62; me again.  He (nor player 2) could see the 20 monsters that killed me 
&#62; twice, but 
&#62; I could see them, and they me, and so I could not be ressurected.
&#62; 
&#62; I find this all very strange. Also, occasionally, the third player
&#62; simply can not join the game.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, the mitigating cirumstance. I am behind a firewall. =) However, 
&#62; we
&#62; are proxying ports 116 and 118 (TCP) inbound and outbound, as well as
&#62; 6112 (UDP) inbound and outbound. The other players are not behind a
&#62; firewall.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, the question arises, are my problems due to my firewall? If they
&#62; are, then there must some other port that I need to open or proxy, 
&#62; and I
&#62; would appreciate it if you guys could let me know what that port might
&#62; be.
&#62; 
&#62; If the problems are not related to the firewall, do you have any
&#62; suggestions as to what might be causing this, 'cause it's really 
&#62; ruining
&#62; my enjoyment of the game.
&#62; 
&#62; I had spoken to someone in the tech support chat room on Battle.net
&#62; before about the firewall, but he has yet to get back to me, and it's 
&#62; been over a week.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for any help you can give!

Rob,

The porst you mentioned about are the only ones used to connect to 
battle.net and play games, so I don't think this is not a problem 
with your ports.

You say you usually play with 3 people -- are these the same people?  
If they are, then you should make sure that, if they are using a 
modem to dialup to their ISP, they have these modem settings:

Click on Start -- settings -- control panel
Open Modem
click on Modem
select properties
select the connection tab
select Advanced
make sure that Use Flow Control is selected and set it to Hardware
Turn on Error Control -- select Compress Data
Click OK
click on the Port Settings button
click on the default button
click OK

If you are playing with different people, then try to play with 
people with which you have a low latency (the kind of problem you are 
experience can happen in high latency games).  

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
