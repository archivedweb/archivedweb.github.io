<pre>Here is a wierd one.
Monday morning when I tried to dial into my ISP it kept saying my 
password was invalid. After 2 hours on the phone, with everyone but 
me being able to log on using my id to my ISP. I decided to reload 
windows 95 over itself.

Immediately I was able to log onto my ISP.

When I tried to install service pack 1, it would run but would not 
update my release number to an xxx xxx  xxxa.

When I instaled the patches kernal patch ole patch (wouldn't load)
a couple of other patches wouldn't load the nuke patches. while I was 
still logged up, I could connect to my ISP.  When I powered down my 
machine.  and turned it back on, I could no longer connect to my ISP 
with then same password problem. 

I kept reinstalling windows and service pack 1 and after each install 
would power down power up and connect to my ISP, then try the next 
patch power down, back up connect to ISP.  I kept trying it until I 
installed a patch where I couldn't connect to my ISP.

Two patches seemed to be the cuplrit the password patch 
(Mspwlupd.exe) and the second nuke patch (vipupd.exe).  I  even tried 
downloading new versions of the patches but had the same result.

My machine worked fine with all patches installed for about 2 months.

I cannot fully install the service pack 1 to where my release number 
reflects that it is installed
the following patches will not install at all: backupd2.exe 
dsktsupd.exe secupd.exe and the ole patch whatever the full name is. 
they all come back with an error and never fully install.

I have reinstalled windows about 7 times and currently have just the 
reinstalled Win95  loaded on my machine.  And I can get on my ISP.

I downloaded Mcafee's trial version of their virus scan, and my 
machine has no viruses.

Anybody have any Ideas.  If I can't get on my ISP I can't answer 
questions here or ge on Battlenet.  ( I am doing this at work)

And If i cant install the service pac and all the patches, I am 
running with an unstable machine subject to nukes and  other woes 
that the patches are supposed to fix.

My machine is 3 and 1/2 years old and was an upgraded from win3.1 to 
Win95 in May of this year.

As far as I can tell all other non communication software is working 
ok.

And I can dialup to work using PcAnywhere and Crosstalk both of which 
do not use TCP/IP

Any suggestions/solutions would be appreciated.</pre>
