<pre>Hello,

I'm having the stangest problem when I attempt to play multiplayer 
games
over battle.net.

I usually play with 3 people. When anyone of us starts a game, one
player can join without a problem. The third player can then join, but
he is usually inivisble to the second player.  Occasionally the third
player can see chat messages from the second player, but they are not
associated with a name. That is, normally when you chat you see
something like:

playerName (playerLevel 25): Hi there!

Well, what the third player sees from player 2 is:

(Level 0): hi there!

And player 2 cannot see player 3 at all.

Another symptom: We decided to play anyway, with myself being unable 
to see
player 2, and vice-versa.  We went into the Caves and I got killed.  
Player 1
ressurected me... but there were about 20 monsters right there and 
they killed
me again.  He (nor player 2) could see the 20 monsters that killed me 
twice, but 
I could see them, and they me, and so I could not be ressurected.

I find this all very strange. Also, occasionally, the third player
simply can not join the game.

Now, the mitigating cirumstance. I am behind a firewall. =) However, 
we
are proxying ports 116 and 118 (TCP) inbound and outbound, as well as
6112 (UDP) inbound and outbound. The other players are not behind a
firewall.

Now, the question arises, are my problems due to my firewall? If they
are, then there must some other port that I need to open or proxy, 
and I
would appreciate it if you guys could let me know what that port might
be.

If the problems are not related to the firewall, do you have any
suggestions as to what might be causing this, 'cause it's really 
ruining
my enjoyment of the game.

I had spoken to someone in the tech support chat room on Battle.net
before about the firewall, but he has yet to get back to me, and it's 
been over a week.

Thanks for any help you can give!
Rob
