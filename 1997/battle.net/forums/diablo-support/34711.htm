&#62; I thought that UO was going to take me to a better place but 
&#62; unfortunately it has not.  I eagerly await Starcraft, Diablo 2 is too 
&#62; far in the future to even venture a guess.  I dont mind answering 
&#62; questions, and helping people, but I would much rather be playing a 
&#62; good game.  I have played Diablo to no end, Quaked it up forever, 
&#62; UO'd till I got burnt out, Dungeon Keepered the night away, and X-
&#62; wing vs Tie Fighter my way thru the night.  As soon as a game comes 
&#62; around that can take my spare time away, I still will lurk here.  The 
&#62; days of me answering every question are over.  There are no longer 
&#62; that many questions to answer.  When I first came here, it was me, 
&#62; WARGASM, Brandus and Support.  We were the regulars, and there were 
&#62; tons of questions, the little page numbers would be at 7 or 8.  I 
&#62; remember the time we answered every question on a weekend, we solved 
&#62; every one, followed up on each post back, hell I even called a guy 
&#62; long distance to fix his stuff over the phone.(he had a 800 number)  
&#62; Now there are more regulars and a lot less questions.  If there is a 
&#62; need for it, The Helper will be there, but now, there is not enough 
&#62; to go around.  Rest assured that I am lurking this page, for some 
&#62; reason I just cannot seem to get it off my computer, I have tried 
&#62; deleting bookmarks, everything, but nothing works.  We will just have 
&#62; to see what happens.
&#62; 
&#62; Bye for now,
&#62; 
&#62; The Helper
