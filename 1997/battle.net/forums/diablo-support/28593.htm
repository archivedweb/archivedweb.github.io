&#62; I have been playing quite alot, so have been my friends, most of us 
&#62; have several level 40+ characters and we noticed one very interesting 
&#62; thing:
&#62;  You can find items with ONLY suffixes and prefixes which handled by 
&#62; either Grizwold or Adria. There are several suffixes and prefixes 
&#62; which are just impossible to find and only way to obtain them is to 
&#62; buy them from Wirt. Since Grizwold does not sell Emerald items, it 
&#62; seemed at first that this may be wrong, but Adria does sell emerald 
&#62; staffs!So there are list of suffixes and prefixes which are not sold 
&#62; by neither Adria nor Grizwold and which cannot be found in Labirinth:
&#62; Strange
&#62; Wierd
&#62; Ruthless
&#62; Mersiless
&#62; Mammoth
&#62; Whales
&#62; Holy
&#62; Godly
&#62; Thunder
&#62; Burning
&#62; Slaughter
&#62; 
&#62; there may be several more I don't remeber. However, I noticed that 
&#62; NONE of above prefixes were NEVER found by me nor by my friends in 
&#62; Labirinth. Now, it may be not important to you, but to folks who 
&#62; still play Diablo and consider themselves Legit players it is 
&#62; important!
&#62; We noticed that Wirt keep his prices in 140,000 range, i.e he never 
&#62; sells anything for over 140,000 gold! Nor does Grizwold. So since 
&#62; Wirt never sells anything CHEAPER then Grizwold, it is impossible to 
&#62; obtain things such as Godly Plate of the whales legit way, no matter 
&#62; how many times you lurk into &#34;Deeper levels of dungeon&#34;, 
&#62; because those items just cannot be found! Where is GPOW's coming 
&#62; from? Well I asked folks who played Single player game and they told 
&#62; me that pricing policy in Single player mode is DIFFERENT, in fact 
&#62; EVERYTHING is about 25&#37; of what it usually cost in 
&#62; multyplayer!Now if you hack your SINGLE player character to level for 
&#62; example 99 and then add unlimited gold hack you will only have to buy 
&#62; item each time you visit wirt! Eventually you will be able to BUY 
&#62; GPOW from him! I was assured that there are cheat programs which 
&#62; allow you to transfer items from single player to multy player. Well 
&#62; I already knew that! Since there is SO many items which can be found 
&#62; only in multyplayer.. anyway
&#62; QUESTION IS:
&#62; Am I right and GPOW was hacked from single player mode?
&#62; P.S. I would also love to know if there is Veil of Steel in 
&#62; multiplayer game, I never found it , but some folks I asked said THEY 
&#62; did!
You are right on.  Actually you probably don't have to change GPOW 
over, but rather turn a godly leather iteam of whales to plate by 
hacking.  Actually the image of the single player Veil of Steal turns 
into the Gotterdamrung (sp?) in multi-player.  These are completly 
different iteams.
I've noticed other iteams of intrest in single player includeing a 
bow of gore, which I've never found in multiplayer.</pre>
