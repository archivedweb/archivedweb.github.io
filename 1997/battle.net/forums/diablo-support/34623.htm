Lonara is correct.  In multi player you have three things you can do 
to add levels real fast.  

One is that you can go directly to the catecombs caves and hell, once 
you have achieved a minimum level requirement.  Each entrance will 
tell you what the minimum is if you are not already qualified.  Also 
you are not required to clear out all levels before going to the next 
level.  I act you can go directly to level 5 in a game, and choose 
not to play levels 1-4 at all.

Each time you start the game all levels are started over with new 
monsters to be killed, and the bosses are ressurected, waiting to be 
killed again.  You can play level 1 as often as you want by quiting 
and starting a new game, but when you stop gaining experience you 
should go down to a deeper levels.

Finally there are three degrees of difficulty. when you reach level 
20 you can play nightmare difficulty.  A level 20 character will 
start earning lots of experience on level one again if he plays 
nightmare difficulty.  Also normal earns you 1-12 gold on level one, 
Nightmare earns you 50-120 gold on level one, and hell 100-200 gold 
on level 1.  You can start playing Hell difficulty once you reach 
level 30.

The monsters are also tougher to kill on the higher difficulty 
settings.</pre>
