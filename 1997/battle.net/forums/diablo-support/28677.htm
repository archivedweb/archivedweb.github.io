&#62; Since I learned I can only post twice in a day I'll break this into 
&#62; three distinct questions: 1.) I followed the instuctions after my 
&#62; last freeze ups and all seemed well.  Until my son was playing for 
&#62; about 45 minutes and tried to join a new game.  He hit &#34;Join&#34; 
&#62; and the screen went black.  THe Music was still playing.  Through the 
&#62; dumb luck of tapping madly on the keyboard I found the &#34;Task 
&#62; List&#34; and was able to terminate the operation -- sort of.  First, 
&#62; even though the Tast List showed &#34;Diablo&#34; at the top of the 
&#62; list it said (in parentheses) something to the effect that it was 
&#62; &#34;no longer active&#34;.  I can't swear to you then what I 
&#62; terminated to wrestle control back of my computer; I just kept 
&#62; terminating till I got a screen back with an image on it. (This 
&#62; process w/ the Task List was done in a weird b&w negatige image.)  
&#62; When I did get a picture back it was &#34;posterized&#34; or 
&#62; solarized&#34; whatever you want to call it.  And after I got out of 
&#62; it (it was the pic of the hut at the begining of the game) my desktop 
&#62; was once again too big for my monitor and I had to reset my monitor 
&#62; control settings. (BTW, per your advice, I now have a special setting 
&#62; for &#34;Battle.net&#34; in my control panel [640x480 @ 256] and it 
&#62; was set to that when play was begun.)  What might have happened this 
&#62; time to cause this type of freeze?  I've told my son he can't sign on 
&#62; until we get an answer and a fix...  

You should manually set your video display to 640x480 and 256 colors 
before you play Diablo.  Do this by going to My Computer - Control 
Panel - Display - Properties - settings.  Make sure you apply the 
changes before you exit, you might have to reboot your computer.  If 
I am right, you were really not in 640x480 256 colors when you 
started Diablo, and when you exited out, the display area was not 
reset to whatever it was set to properly.  I have seen exactly what 
you have described before, because I run in 800x600 256 colors and if 
I get kicked out of Diablo, my display will be in 640x480 and things 
will be mildly screwed up until a reboot.  The funky color scheme you 
saw happens sometimes when errors like this happen.

Question #2.)  Somehow by doing 
&#62; the deletes and new graphics settings you prescribed for the last 
&#62; fix, something has disappeared: when &#34;Diablo&#34; lists the 
&#62; &#34;multi-player options&#34; now the ONLY OPTION SHOWN NOW is 
&#62; &#34;B.net&#34;, all the others like &#34;Modem&#34; and IPX and such 
&#62; are no longer there! POOF! What happened?  {I'm most curious since I 
&#62; told my son until we iron out B.net he could at least play modem-to-
&#62; modem with a friend...}

For this problem, I might be telling you a little more than you have 
to do but if you follow the directions, it will definitely fix the 
problem.

Go to My Computer - Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs - Battle.net 
and remove

After that do the same thing for Diablo, except when you uninstall 
Diablo there will be a little box that it titled also delete saved 
games.  You want to make sure the box is clear if you want to save 
your characters.

After that, go to your Diablo folder, make sure the file BNCACHE.DAT 
is gone, if it is not, delete it.  Also make sure there is nothing 
left in your Diablo folder except for patch executables and your 
single player save game file.

If you do not already have the version 1.04 patch, you should 
manually download it from

<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/support/diablo/patch.htm">http://www.blizzard.com/support/diablo/patch.htm</a>

That file DRTL104.exe goes in your Diablo folder.

Reinstall Diablo, do not play Diablo at this time exit and apply the 
patch.

Run the patch.

Go ahead and try Diablo, your multiplayer options should be back.  I 
am sorry for the long list but I know it will give you back your 
options.  There is a probably an easier way but since no one else is 
answering, thats all I got.

&#62;  And finally, #3.) Where are the 
&#62; &#34;B.net&#34; files located exactly on my computer?  Is it 
&#62; &#34;Battle.snp&#34; under the Diablo directory?  It was only 
&#62; suggested before that I delete B.net and since I could find no 
&#62; separate directory I did not delete it (though I did delete the 
&#62; bncache.dat and all the temp files and I emptied my trashbin too just 
&#62; to make sure.) I'm still at heart a DOS guy so I like to know where 
&#62; everything is and to do a direct delete.
&#62; 

As far as I know, the only file that belongs to Battle.net is 
BNCACHE.dat.  In windows 95, you should always try to uninstall an 
application before you delete it.  I have described to you how 
uninstall Battle.net.  It is automatically reinstalled the next time 
you log onto Battle.net.  It may be that you only need to delete the 
file BNCACHE.DAT to uninstall Diablo, I like to do it the way I know.



&#62; THANKS IN ADVANCE, AGAIN, FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
&#62; 
&#62; CJ

Hope this helps,
