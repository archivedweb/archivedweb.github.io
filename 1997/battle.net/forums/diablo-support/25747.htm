&#62; I have been playing DIABLO since It was originally released.  I have
&#62; about 6 chars that are level 33 +  all are legit and have 3 dots..
&#62; 
&#62; What I want to know is...  Is there a reason for me to keep playing ??
&#62; 
&#62; I know this sounds like a strange question..  I like playing for the 
&#62; items,  its what keeps me going..  The hope that I will find 
&#62; something better than what I am using.   
&#62; 
&#62; Will I find better items than what I have ?  Example,  My rogue has 
&#62; eaglehorn&windforce ( are there kings bows ?)..   I have ac75 awesome 
&#62; plate (does holy/godly plate exist ?)..  
&#62; 
&#62; Keep in mind that i play only multi-player games (b.net)..  Throw me 
&#62; a 
&#62; bone..  tell me there is alot better stuff if i keep working at it.  
&#62; I would imagine at the point where I am, i am gonna need to find 
&#62; these things instead of buy them due to the fast they would cost more 
&#62; than could be bought  (the most $$ thing i have seen is in the 130k-
&#62; 140k range)
&#62; 
&#62; Do I look in hell/hell ??  or does normal/hell have just as good of 
&#62; stuff ?
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for any info you can give..  
&#62;

  Hmmm if you go to hell/hell yes there will be way better items then 
the lower diffs you do have really good items for a legit player I 
must say. Yes godly and holy plate do exist but, you must look in a 
hell/hell game for those types of items. I don't believe that there 
is a king's bow (I wish they was one) eaglehorn and windforce are 
pretty good look for merc bows in hell/hell.

  Shan't worry Diablo 2 is just around the corner it should be out 
one month before xmas (I hope) anyways thats my input on your 
questions.
