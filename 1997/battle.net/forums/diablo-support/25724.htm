<pre>The Helper,

I don't mind at all if you give it a shot.  I appreciate help from 
anyone willing to provide it.

Both machines are running V1.03 of Diablo, so I guess I'll have to 
replace the cable and see what happens.

Thanks for the help,

Scott

&#62; &#62; Hi Pat,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I think the problem I am having might be caused by the cable I am 
&#62; &#62; using.  It is a plain serial cable with a null modem adapter.  It 
&#62; &#62; works fine with Win95 DCC, Warcraft 2 and XvT.  Do I need to buy a 
&#62; &#62; null modem cable for Diablo to work, or should it work with the cable 
&#62; &#62; I am using?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I posted awhile back about problems I had with direct connection.  I 
&#62; &#62; had a problem with Diablo crashing as soon as I chose Direct 
&#62; &#62; Connection on either system.  Your advice was to check for IRQ 
&#62; &#62; conflicts.  Both systems had conflicts which have now been resolved.  
&#62; &#62; I'm having a different problem now.  I'm able to create a Direct 
&#62; &#62; Connect game on either system, but can't connect with the other 
&#62; &#62; system.  When I click retry connection on one system (with a direct 
&#62; &#62; connect game already running on the other system),  I get a message 
&#62; &#62; saying that no direct connect game was detected.  Here's info on the 
&#62; &#62; two systems.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Both are running Win95 w/Service pack 1, Kernel update and password 
&#62; &#62; update.  Both systems have different names.  Both systems have at 
&#62; &#62; least 400 MB of free HD space.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Packard Bell Pentium 120,  24 MB ram
&#62; &#62; Diamond Stealth 2000 (latest drivers installed)
&#62; &#62; Packard Bell Sound2 288SP sound card
&#62; &#62; modem on com1
&#62; &#62; serial cable on com2
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The second system belongs to a friend.  The only thing I am not sure 
&#62; &#62; about is the sound card.  Under sound, video and game controllers in 
&#62; &#62; Device Manager, no sound card is listed; however, the sound on his 
&#62; &#62; system works fine in all programs including Diablo.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Cyrix P150+, 32 MB ram
&#62; &#62; STB Lightspeed 128 (latest drivers installed)
&#62; &#62; unknown sound card
&#62; &#62; serial mouse on com3
&#62; &#62; serial cable on com4
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Scott
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; ps:  Thanks for the quick reply on my last post.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm not Pat but if you don't mind, can I give it a shot?  You need to 
&#62; have a null modem cable to play direct connect with another computer 
&#62; with Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; Both of the computers need to be the same version of Diablo.  You can 
&#62; check the version of Diablo in the choose type of game screen on 
&#62; Diablo startup, it will be at the bottom.  Both of the computers 
&#62; should be version 1.03, if they are not repost and I can help you 
&#62; more from there.
&#62; 
&#62; Hope this helps,
&#62;
