&#62; It's like you run a hex-editor while running diablo(even hexing 
&#62; something other than diablo) and diablo crashes. You'd think they 
&#62; could just say something &#34;We caught you cheating.&#34; and stop 
&#62; what you were trying to do. but no, it's &#34;We caught you cheating, 
&#62; now we're gonna crash your computer. HAHAHAHAHA.&#34; i mean they 
&#62; spend thousands of hours trying to figure out why YOUR COMPUTER needs 
&#62; to be fuked up. there worse than then little adolestent hackers bent 
&#62; on destroying all computers. one time my brother and i had four 
&#62; inventories FULL of LEGIT items we FOUND and my brother didn't want 
&#62; to get rid of his items(he ran out of room) so he used a hack so the 
&#62; items only took one space in the inventory. Well blizzard decided 
&#62; that we didn't need all those items we spent months collecting, and 
&#62; that we didn't have to know where the problem file was! blizzard wont 
&#62; disclose where it saves charector files on YOUR computer. they're 
&#62; response to any problems is &#34;uninstall and reinstall. the 
&#62; charectors lost is YOUR fault.&#34; well i hope some blizzard lackee 
&#62; reads this because im pissed. well i found the save files and im not 
&#62; holding back. the single player save files are saved in the diablo 
&#62; directory and there really not hard to find &#34;save_0.sv&#34; i 
&#62; think, but i haven't played single player for a while. the 
&#62; multiplayer files are little bit more complicated, and are kept in 
&#62; the windows directory with the names &#34;dlinfo_0.drv&#34;-
&#62; &#34;dlinfo_10.drv&#34; depending on how many multiplayer chars you 
&#62; have. if you have the problem where everytime you click on 
&#62; multiplayer on the main menu, diablo crashes, it's probably one of 
&#62; your chars(incorrect placement, altered attributes etc.) so, you 
&#62; figured out what's wrong, now what do you do?
&#62; well first and formost, DO NOT goto blizzard or ask ANY blizzard 
&#62; employee. they hate cheats and think that you should pay by 
&#62; uninstalling your diablo chars. they get ALOT of fun messing with 
&#62; cheaters(personal experiance[telling them that it laughable to cheat, 
&#62; making fun of them, banning them, and basically not caring at all, 
&#62; even though half of all questions are cheat-related{the rest are from 
&#62; newbies that don't know how to press F1}]) and should NOT be trusted. 
&#62; i have been told MANY times to re-install diablo by ignorant blizzard 
&#62; techs. the main fact is, blizzard knows less about how the hackers 
&#62; cheat than the hackers know about diablo. if they left diablo up to 
&#62; the (RESPONSIBLE)hackers (see raymond's diablo page) almost every 
&#62; single problem would be solved within days. but no, we cant let the 
&#62; people with REAL intelligence take care of things because they might 
&#62; make our little baby easier for newbies!</pre>
