<pre>After posting here several times, I tried sending a description of my 
multiplayer problems to support@blizzard.com.  To their credit, I 
received a reply within a day.  To their discredit, it looked very 
much like a &#34;canned&#34; reply, and I doubt that they bothered to 
read my problem report carefully.  

Here is a shortened copy of my response.  My hope is that somebody at 
Blizzard will take the time to really read it and send an 
&#34;uncanned&#34; response.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1.04 patch installs fine and runs perfectly in single-player 
mode.  As soon as I try to play any type of multiplayer game, 
(battle.net or IPX) I crash within 2 minutes.

Note:  I had NO multiplayer problems with v1.00 under the same system 
configuration. Why, why, why does the patch cause these problems to 
start?  Note:  I have repeated this process several times:
  Uninstall Diablo.
  Install 1.00.
  Play IPX multiplayer with no problem.
  Add 1.03 OR 1.04 patch.
  Crash, crash, crash.

I have tried manually installing the patch, and I have tried letting 
battle.net do the upgrade for me automatically.

For what it's worth, I am NOT a novice computer user.  I am a senior 
software developer for an Internet company, and have an intimate 
understanding of Windows95/NT.  I've been meticulous in my efforts to 
try and solve this problem.  I've tried every suggestion that has 
been posted to the web tech support forum.  Nothing has worked.  I 
suspect that a bug was introduced in the patches - obviously a very 
subtle one that is sensitive to certain hardware configurations.

Would really appreciate some detailed feedback.  Even if Blizzard 
doesn't have an immediate solution, I would like to at least hear 
that you guys recognize this problem, and that it is being addressed. 
 There are lots of other users like me who have posted messages 
describing the same problem.  It seems that we are all getting the 
same &#34;canned&#34; response from Blizzard.
