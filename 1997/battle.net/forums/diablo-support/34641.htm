&#62; Great that you got it working finally.  Was it Internal or external 
&#62; cache that was disabled?  If it was one of these, motherboard will 
&#62; need to be looked at.  If it was the Internal cache, you will see a 
&#62; great performance drop and will want to get it fixed (normally I just 
&#62; replace Motherboard) If it was external cache, a performance drop is 
&#62; still noticable but not as bad.  This can be replaced by a tech.  
&#62; Normally still cheaper to get another board.  if it was one of the 
&#62; video cache settings disabled, your ok then (hope hope hope).  Might 
&#62; want to find out which one.  But congrats on the fix!!

I figured it was a hardware problem considering everything you tried 
to fix it. You should not have to get a new motherboard just because 
the cache doesn't work properly. However, you might want to consider  
taking it to a tech so he can pinpoint the cause of your cache 
problem. Any one of these may be the cause.
1. Bad Cache chip. There was even trouble earlier with fake cache 
chips being put into computers. If you bought your computer from a 
top vender then you should be ok.
2.If your memory chips have different time ratings then it might be 
causing your problems with the cache.

There are other possibilities as well. I am very happy that you got 
it working. :) Perhaps we can play a game on battlenet sometime. :)  
Your friend,  Lonara</pre>
