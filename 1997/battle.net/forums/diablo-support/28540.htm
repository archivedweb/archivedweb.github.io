<pre>Okay I'll tell you from the beginning. 1st last Saturday I bought 
DIABLO. Then Saturday, Sunday, and Monday I played Battle.net all day 
basically but only in the DUGEONS. 

Then on Tuesday morning I started play and I got a level hi enough 
level to go to the CATACOMBS. When I had entered I played like for 5 
to 10 minutes then all of a sudden DIABLO closed and like 5 seconds 
later a screen came up and said illegal operation: in DIABLO.EXE. Yep 
I know everyone knows them because there posted all around these 
pages.

Well I read all the messages on it and I tried everything &#34;The 
Helper&#34; and &#34;Blizzard Support&#34; says and nothing worked. I 
tried deleting the BNCACHE.DAT file that never worked. I tried 
unistalling Battle.net. I tried unistalling DIABLO. Then I had sent 
email to Blizzard tech-support they sent me back a list of crap to do 
I tried all and it still came up with the same &#34;IO&#34;.

This problems occurs in Moderm and on Battle.net games. In single 
player game I don't think this happens but I'm not sure because I 
haven't yet gotten to the CATACOMBS. 

Display: S3 ViRGE

Sound Card: AZT 2316/R Audio Driver

Windows Version: 4.00.950 B

System: Petium/166

RAM: 32

Modem: Supra Express 336i PnP

ISP: AOL 95 (for Windwos 95)

CD Speed: 10X

HD Free Space: 504 meg

One last thing DirectX 3.0. I installed it and when I do one of the 
drivers it updates causes another problem with DIABLO. Here goes the 
problem. I'll open up DIABLO then next theing I know is that a blue 
screen comes up. It looks like its in DOS based Windows is 
highlighted in Grey and the below a message says a fatal exception 
has occured 0E has occured @ 0028:c027542B in VxD VWIN32(04) + 
00002AF7. The current application will be terminated. 

That is why I can't install DIRECTX 3.0. I had talked to Blizzard 
Tech-Support on Battle.net and they told me to get the newest DIRECTX 
because that's what might be causing the illegal operation so I had 
went and gotten DIRECTX 3.0a and tried it out the same problem had 
occured. Then I saw that DirectX 2.0 may work better with other 
computers so I had went and got that but I ran the program and I 
wasn't even sure if it installed it or not. If it did instal it it 
didn't help anyways becuase I still got the same problem. 

Well if you can help me I am open to many and I mean many suggestions 
if you can email do so okay GOOD LUCK.
