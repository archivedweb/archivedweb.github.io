<pre>I have noticed several recurring themes and would like to post this
as an answer to some of them remember if you have questions after 
reading or are still confused ask BLIZZARD.  If you think some of 
this is wrong again ask BLIZZARD or please reply and I will change 
it. 

1.  I dont know why Blizzard will not just post this in their FAQ 
because of the many cheats that are loose that mess peoples systems
up but here is how you transfer characters from one computer to 
another:

 Look in your windows dir and copy the file(s) dlinfo_*.drv (* is a 
wildcard) to diskette.  open MY COMPUTER select NETWORK select VIEW 
then OPTIONS then IDENTIFICATION and make sure that the name of the 
computer which you are transferring to is the same as that which you 
are transferring from.  copy the dlinfo_*.drv to the windows dir on 
the new computer.  To view hidden files select MY COMPUTER,  right 
click on VIEW, OPTIONS, VIEW, then 
select SHOW ALL FILES,  select OK.

2. there is no secret COW LEVEL its a SNIPE HUNT

3. Duping is cheating

4. dont cheat using hacks it can only lead to unstable systems and 
possible viruses BLIZZARD will not support hacks.

5. Please dont SPAM I dont buy it in the grocery why would I want it 
here.

6. my working definition of cheating and hacking:  Cheating is when 
you use an outside program to influence another program in a way 
unintended by the original author.  restoring a backed up character 
if your game crashed on you in B.Net is not cheating but restoring 
just because you got your Butt Kicked is.  Hacking is creating 
outside programs to influence another program outside of its intended 
parameters.

7. you cannot change the name of your character nor transfer them 
from multi to single and vice versa without cheating.

8. Lvl 50 is the highest level.

9. shareware and full version are not compatable on B.net

10. The lights next to your name on B.net represents computer lag 
green is good red is bad.

11. Read BLIZZARD's FAQ

If you find any of this wrong please post and i will change it thanks.

                            
                            Janna Lvl 41 Rogue

PS this is my last Post for two weeks ill be gone till the first of 
the month or so, visiting relatives, see ya when i get back. </pre>
