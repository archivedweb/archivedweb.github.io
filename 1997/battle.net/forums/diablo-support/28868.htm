&#62; &#62; I tried all of the things you said...Well actually I tried them 
&#62; &#62; before I asked for help. I do get into aol 3.0 for win 95 thru 
&#62; &#62; program files on the start button. I have ver. 1.04 for Diablo. I 
&#62; &#62; believe that my modem is set up right. I can connect to aol, but I 
&#62; &#62; still get the red screen telling me to connect manually.
&#62; &#62; A refresher. I have a 166mhz 32 meg ram, and run win 95. Help....
&#62; 
&#62; That red screen you are getting trying to use AOL says that Diablo is 
&#62; not detecting your connection to the internet.  This can be caused by 
&#62; a few different issues, either you are not connected to the internet 
&#62; when you try and play Diablo or your version of AOL 95 is not 
&#62; installed correctly.  You should make positive and sure that you are 
&#62; connected to the internet using AOL 95 before you start Diablo.  If 
&#62; you verify you are, you should reinstall AOL for Windows 95 and make 
&#62; sure it is installed correctly.  If none of that works I am out of 
&#62; ideas, I hope Blizzard or someone else can take you home on this one. 
&#62;  You might want to give AOL technical support a try, find out how you 
&#62; can verify that your AOL for Win 95 is installed correctly.
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry I could not help you further,

Helper,

This is true, when AOL users are given this message, this means that 
they are not using the 32bit version of AOL (i.e. AOL for windows 
95), or they have not installed it correctly (though this is more 
rare).

Jason,

I know this is repetitive, but, if you are not absolutely positive 
you have AOL for windows 95, make sure that you are using it.  When 
you run AOL, click on Help, then about America Online.  It must 
actually say in the About window that you are using AOL for Windows 
95.

Also make sure that you have actually connected to AOL before you run 
Diablo.  If you run AOL for windows 95, but do not connect to AOL (by 
clicking on the Connect Now button), then you will get the error 
message you are receiving when trying to connect to battle.net.

If you are connected to AOL and are still getting the 32bit 
applications message when trying to connect to battle.net, then 
uninstall battle.net (not Diablo) using the Add/Remove Programs icon 
in your control panel (to get there, click on Start--Settings--
Control panel).  Make sure the file bncache.dat is deleted from your 
Diablo folder.  Then, connect to AOL again and try to connect to 
battle.net.

If you're still having probelms, see if you are able to run other 
32bit internet applications (like Netscape or Internet Explorer for 
windows 95).  If you are unable to use these, then contact AOL for 
help in installing AOL for windows 95 so that you can use 32bit 
internet applications.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
