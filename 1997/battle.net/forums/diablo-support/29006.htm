&#62; I posted a question couple of posts below concerning GPOW and I got 
&#62; the &#34;USUAL&#34; answer i.e. keep looking, however, I didn't ask 
&#62; what are my chances to dfind it, I pointed on class of items 
&#62; impossible to find! Those which are sold by wirt. If we look at 
&#62; modern GPOW's and rest of godly plates, we can notice one STRANGE 
&#62; detail, it has ONLY plus to HP or Osmosis or Ages suffixes. Those are 
&#62; ONLY ones which are supported by Wirt for armors, I saw about 6 
&#62;  different kinds of Godly plate of the whales, and I never heard of 
&#62; Godly plate of Gigants or Sorcery or Anything else for that matter! 
&#62; Let me assure you that I found MUCH more items with suffix &#34;of 
&#62; sorcery&#34; then anything of the whales! That can let us track items 
&#62; right back to Wirt. About cost of GPOW, It's 240,000 gold pieces. At 
&#62; least Griswold when offers a 1/4 of price offers over 60,000 for it. 
&#62; I know it's possible to buy Godly plate of the whales in form of 
&#62;  breast plate, however It's absolutely impossible to buy anything 
&#62;  godly with ac over 50! Holy plate with ac 43 cost 133000! Once 
&#62; again, 
&#62; we are talking NOT about single Godly plate, but about absence of a 
&#62;  CLASS of suffixes/prefixes in dungeon. For example &#34;Wierd&#34; 
&#62;  this prefix is fairly weak, it has same to hit with &#34;King's&#34; 
&#62; but lack damage, why is it SO rare? In fact it's same rare with GPOW 
&#62; to find! Or Ruthless,..... if number of Savage bows/number of Massive 
&#62; bows = number of Ruthless bows/number of Savage bows found in Dungeon 
&#62; I should at least found 15 of them with EACH character! I found like 
&#62; 100 Awesome armors ranging from rags to full plates, YET I never 
&#62; found ANY SINGLE piece of HOLY armor! Leave alone Godly. Are you 
&#62;  saying that Godly plates can be only found along with suffix of 
&#62; Whales? I would ask you please check it with creators of the game. I 
&#62;  know it may sound non important to you, but once again, it's a great 
&#62;    deal of Importance to us gamers!
Eugene,
     There is indead, Godly plate of the Ages and other suffixes.  I 
personally have found Godly Plate of the Ages in the dungeon.  Any 
godly item is extremely rare.  As are the item types you mentioned.  
As for why they are rare?  Well a number of reasons, play balance, 
fun factor, mystery, etc...
