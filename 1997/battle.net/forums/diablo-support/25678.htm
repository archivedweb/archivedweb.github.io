<pre>I apologize to the author of the following. Apprently I only copied 
the message and not the writer. But I kept this because I thought it 
was a rather interesting way to communicate some problems legit 
players and Blizzard face on Battle.net.

This was posted soon after V1.02, I think. But I think it still 
applies.

********
The Starship Diablo of the Blizzard Federation is on a routine 
mission in the Tristram Quadrant.  When suddenly they were attacked 
by the Warships Townkill, Autokill and the mighty Trainer.  A smaller 
scout ship, Goldcheat, was circling behind. Pirate ships belonging to 
a villainous organization known as the Hacks.

The three enemy ships began firing immediately.

&#34;Shields holding captain,&#34; reported the first crewman Rich.

&#34;The encrypted hull is completed undamaged,&#34; bragged Mike, 
the  science officer.

&#34;Good,&#34; replied the captain.  &#34;Let them blast away!  
Proceed with our mission.&#34;

Suddenly after one parsec, &#34;Captain!  The scout ship had managed 
to   contaminate the ship with bad latium!  The crew is consumed with 
greed. Credit is now worthless!&#34;

Pat the chief medical officer arrives on the bridge.  &#34;Morale has 
dropped 25&#37;.  Damn it Captain! I'm a doctor not an 
entertainer!&#34;

&#34;Tell the crew they can have all the credits they want, it's our  
   equipment that the Hacks want.  Maintain our course ensign 
Rich.&#34;

As the starship Diablo rounded the second parsec, &#34;Captain, the 
Trainer has fired a direct hit!  Our shields are down to 66.6&#37;! 
50th level space warriors are beaming on board!!,&#34;screamed Rich.

&#34;Calm down ensign!  Dispatch a security team.  Tell the crew to 
stick 
together, hang around with only people they know.&#34;  Damn the 
Captain of Trainer, Enigma, is better than we expected thought the 
Captain.

&#34;I have bad news Captain...&#34; the science officer frowned.

&#34;Yes, Mike?&#34;

&#34;The Trainer is cloning our own crewmen against us.&#34;

&#34;What!  How is this possible?&#34;

&#34;It appears they have figured out our shield modulation.  They 
are 
beaming right past the hull.&#34;

&#34;Tell the crew to only make contact with people they absolutely 
trust!  Have the crew use the Dr. Diablo tricorder to detect the 
Hackers.&#34;

Just then, Townkill beams a bunch of Hackers on to the bridge, a once 
safe and secure haven. A massive shootout ensues.

&#34;Captain the Autokill is hailing us,&#34;

A dark horned Hacker appears on the main communication viewer.

&#34;Greetings Diablo crew.  So you thought you could run from us eh? 
 
Thought your encrypted hull was too good to break?  Now you die!&#34;

The entire crew begins to choke.  The ships artificial air blocked 
from their lungs by a magical force.

&#34;Captain morale has dropped 75&#37;,&#34; Dr. Pat announced 
between gasps.

&#34;Mike!  Remodulate the shield, NOW!&#34;

&#34;I'm working as fast as I can Captain, she's giving all she's 
got!  It's going to take at least two megasec!&#34;

As the crew falls to the ground Diablo's engineers manage to 
remodulate its shield.

&#34;Captain, the Trainer, Townkill and Autokill have retreated, for 
now. However, there are still 50th level Hackers run amok aboard the 
ship. And the cloned crew people, though destroyed once the shield 
can on-line, have flooded the ship with bad equipment.  We may never 
dispose all of it.&#34;

&#34;Captain morale has risen to 66.6&#37;&#34;, the Doctor said 
helping others to their feet.

&#34;How long will our shields hold?&#34; Asked the Captain.... 
&#34;Tell the 
crew to enjoy what they can for now.  I'm sure the Hacks will 
return...&#34;</pre>
