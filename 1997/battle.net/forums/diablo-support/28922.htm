<pre>I posted a question couple of posts below concerning GPOW and I got 
the &#34;USUAL&#34; answer i.e. keep looking, however, I didn't ask 
what are my chances to dfind it, I pointed on class of items 
impossible to find! Those which are sold by wirt. If we look at 
modern GPOW's and rest of godly plates, we can notice one STRANGE 
detail, it has ONLY plus to HP or Osmosis or Ages suffixes. Those are 
ONLY ones which are supported by Wirt for armors, I saw about 6 
 different kinds of Godly plate of the whales, and I never heard of 
Godly plate of Gigants or Sorcery or Anything else for that matter! 
Let me assure you that I found MUCH more items with suffix &#34;of 
sorcery&#34; then anything of the whales! That can let us track items 
right back to Wirt. About cost of GPOW, It's 240,000 gold pieces. At 
least Griswold when offers a 1/4 of price offers over 60,000 for it. 
I know it's possible to buy Godly plate of the whales in form of 
 breast plate, however It's absolutely impossible to buy anything 
 godly with ac over 50! Holy plate with ac 43 cost 133000! Once 
again, 
we are talking NOT about single Godly plate, but about absence of a 
 CLASS of suffixes/prefixes in dungeon. For example &#34;Wierd&#34; 
 this prefix is fairly weak, it has same to hit with &#34;King's&#34; 
but lack damage, why is it SO rare? In fact it's same rare with GPOW 
to find! Or Ruthless,..... if number of Savage bows/number of Massive 
bows = number of Ruthless bows/number of Savage bows found in Dungeon 
I should at least found 15 of them with EACH character! I found like 
100 Awesome armors ranging from rags to full plates, YET I never 
found ANY SINGLE piece of HOLY armor! Leave alone Godly. Are you 
 saying that Godly plates can be only found along with suffix of 
Whales? I would ask you please check it with creators of the game. I 
 know it may sound non important to you, but once again, it's a great 
   deal of Importance to us gamers!</pre>
