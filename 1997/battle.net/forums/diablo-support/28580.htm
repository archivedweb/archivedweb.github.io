<pre>I have already posted this but your solution didn't work, you said to 
re-install, run scandisk, delete win-temp, try with all programs 
closed. STILL SAME PROBLEM. Here is my post from last week which 
explains the situation-

I need help!! Urgently!!!
I have had Diablo for more 2 months now and are constantly playing 
battle.net. Today I was in the middle of a game on battle.net and the 
game crashed back into Windows 95. Since then I have not been able to 
go into the multiplayer menu, it CRASHES AS SOON AS I CLICK ON THE 
MULTIPLAYER OPTION. Windows brings up the following:
This program has caused an illegal operation and should be shutdown.
If problem persists contact program vendor
The details show:
DIABLO caused invalid page fault 
in module Diablo.exe at 014f:0046d5gb
Registers:
etc etc (I could give you the actual numbers and stack dumps if you 
need)

I have re-installed Diablo and patch v1.04 (without deleting saved 
games). I have un-installed battle.net and deleted the file 
BNCACHE.DAT and deleted the contents of win-temp folder. I have tried 
different resolutions, turned of all programs not needed and have 
plenty of free disk space ( Also done what you said should fix it). I 
also know that its not my drivers or directx drivers conflicting or 
being out of date, it should be working fine. It has been working for 
months and I have been playing battle.net every night, why now?????
There is also some file called DIABLO.ERR, and there are only 4 saved 
game files which includes my single player characters. Where is my 
battle.net warrior???

Here are my computer details:
Compaq- Presario 8770
Pentium 200mmx
16mb sync dram (ram)
33.6 modem
16 speed CD-ROM
S3 Virge 3D chip
ESS ES1888 Plug and Play Audio Drive (soundblaster pro compatible)

This computer has been working like a dream until now and don't know 
what to do. I think it may work if I totally delete Diablo including 
the saved games and re-install. But I can't do that, its taken me 2 
months, around 2 or more hours each night on battle.net to get my 
warrior where he is, without cheating. That is ALOT of money on 
Internet bills and I do not want to throw that away with some stupid 
crashing problem, if I do ill give up and probably never play 
battle.net and Diablo again. It would be a waste of time and money to 
start from scratch again. I am really stressing out now!
I need help, I love Diablo and need to play battle.net (its an 
addiction) with my built up warrior. </pre>
