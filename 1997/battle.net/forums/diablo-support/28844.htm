<pre>Many of us are having similar problems, and Blizzard doesn't seem to 
have a clue as to what is causing it.  Wish I had better news for you.

&#62; Okay I'll tell you from the beginning. 1st last Saturday I bought 
&#62; DIABLO. Then Saturday, Sunday, and Monday I played Battle.net all day 
&#62; basically but only in the DUGEONS. 
&#62; 
&#62; Then on Tuesday morning I started play and I got a level hi enough 
&#62; level to go to the CATACOMBS. When I had entered I played like for 5 
&#62; to 10 minutes then all of a sudden DIABLO closed and like 5 seconds 
&#62; later a screen came up and said illegal operation: in DIABLO.EXE. Yep 
&#62; I know everyone knows them because there posted all around these 
&#62; pages.
&#62; 
&#62; Well I read all the messages on it and I tried everything &#34;The 
&#62; Helper&#34; and &#34;Blizzard Support&#34; says and nothing worked. I 
&#62; tried deleting the BNCACHE.DAT file that never worked. I tried 
&#62; unistalling Battle.net. I tried unistalling DIABLO. Then I had sent 
&#62; email to Blizzard tech-support they sent me back a list of crap to do 
&#62; I tried all and it still came up with the same &#34;IO&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62; This problems occurs in Moderm and on Battle.net games. In single 
&#62; player game I don't think this happens but I'm not sure because I 
&#62; haven't yet gotten to the CATACOMBS.

&#62; 
&#62; One last thing DirectX 3.0. I installed it and when I do one of the 
&#62; drivers it updates causes another problem with DIABLO. Here goes the 
&#62; problem. I'll open up DIABLO then next theing I know is that a blue 
&#62; screen comes up. It looks like its in DOS based Windows is 
&#62; highlighted in Grey and the below a message says a fatal exception 
&#62; has occured 0E has occured @ 0028:c027542B in VxD VWIN32(04) + 
&#62; 00002AF7. The current application will be terminated. 
&#62; 
&#62; That is why I can't install DIRECTX 3.0. I had talked to Blizzard 
&#62; Tech-Support on Battle.net and they told me to get the newest DIRECTX 
&#62; because that's what might be causing the illegal operation so I had 
&#62; went and gotten DIRECTX 3.0a and tried it out the same problem had 
&#62; occured. Then I saw that DirectX 2.0 may work better with other 
&#62; computers so I had went and got that but I ran the program and I 
&#62; wasn't even sure if it installed it or not. If it did instal it it 
&#62; didn't help anyways becuase I still got the same problem. 
&#62; 
&#62; Well if you can help me I am open to many and I mean many suggestions 
&#62; if you can email do so okay GOOD LUCK.
