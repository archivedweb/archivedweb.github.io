<pre>I posted these questions earlier and you were very kind in your
response, but now I will dscribe the circumstances a little better.

1. &#60;MULTIPLAYER GAME / SOLO, IPX &#62;
   My problem was, that more than once, as I was fighting Laz et.al.
I was hit by a fireball (with full health and full Mana shield), which
killed me in one shot (not a small feat). When I restarted in town, 
I was still wearing all of my equipment! strange, yes?

   This might be related- again, more than once, as I killed everyone
but Laz, I enter his room and he doesn't react! He just stands there,
following me with his head, but not reacting. If I shoot arrows, they 
pass right through him! only when I touch him by walking right up to 
his face does he wake up. What I have done, on occasion, is Stone 
curse him, but like I said my arrows miss, until I stand toe-to-toe,
when he shakes off the curse immediately and lays into me.
   Now, I thought you might be sceptical, so I grabbed a screen shot 
of me, standing near enough to see the color of Laz's eyes, and my 
golem is walking away from him (apparently my golem's can't hurt him 
in this state either).

        Lastly, this has only happened once, : I dropped a port in an 
Empty room, (empty!).  I returned to town, then back thru the portal,
BUT, I was in a room FULL of knights and drakes and soul burners. 
(who very quickly finished me off as I had no time to even through up 
Mana shield.

        Ok, this is really &#34;lastly&#34; :  It is also true that 
on another occasion, as I emerged onto the dungeon through my portal, 
I right clicked to teleport, but I ended up not 40 feet away, but 
400. (the other side of the level)  Now, as I was walking INTO the 
port, I moved  the cursor (that cute little hand) into the top right 
corner of the screen (because that is where I had just died so my 
stuff was waiting for me), and the moment I saw the dungeoin appear 
on my screen, I clicked.

       So, I hope these questions are better now that they are more 
descriptive.

Thank you.
