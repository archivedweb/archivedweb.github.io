<pre>Janna is correct, Blizzard has stated that the monsters and quests 
that are on the CD but not in the game were removed because they 
caused bugs or because of play balance.  Blizzard just did not take 
the time to delete them from the CD.  Space is not a concern, a CD 
can hold plenty of information, since that information is not stored 
on the hard drive of the user, it being on the CD is of no concern.  
That is just my opinion.  I fail to see how you can call Blizzard 
stupid when there game sold over a million units.  If that is stupid, 
let me be a moron.

&#62; I really doubt it that they put those monsters and the other quests

&#62; another 50Mb. We're talking about 3 or more quests which each 
&#62; character and each towner has
&#62; it's own Waves regarding the quest, and I assume some more graphics. 
&#62; It would be very stupid
&#62; to put on the disc things who won't be used. If it's just junk - then 
&#62; they could have saved space,
&#62; time and money on creating every disc. You don't pay studio time for 
&#62; recording without any intention
&#62; to use your material.
&#62; 
&#62; See my point ?
&#62; And beside, some quests have a direct link to the story in the book.</pre>
