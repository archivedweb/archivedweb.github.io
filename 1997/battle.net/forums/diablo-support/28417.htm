&#62; I have read all of your postings on the subject. I am useing aol 3.0 
&#62; for win 95. Yes it is 32 bit. I open aol and go to the web. I 
&#62; minumize, then start Diablo. I get the bad red screen. You know, the 
&#62; one that says connect manually.
&#62; What's up? I have a 166 pentium, 32 meg of ram, 28.8 modem. As far as 
&#62; I can tell, the modem is set up right. flow is on, and I am using 
&#62; hardware vs. software. Help... Also, I tried modem to modem. It 
&#62; connects to the other modem, but say's 
&#62; that the other computer dosn't have Diablo. The other person has the 
&#62; same problem when he tries to call me. Yes he is already in the game..
&#62; Thanks for the help...

Jason,

Lazerjedi's probably nailed your modem-to-modem problem.  If you are 
not using the same version of Diablo, then you will not be able to 
see your friend's game.  If your friend has connected to battle.net 
recently, then they are using v1.04 of Diablo.  Because you are still 
having trouble connecting, you probably are using version 1.0.  The 
v1.04 patch is available on our web site here:
<a href="http://www.blizzard.com/library/patches.htm">http://www.blizzard.com/library/patches.htm</a>

You should download this patch into your Diablo folder, and run it.  
This will update your version to v1.04.  If your friend is not using 
this version, then he should download the patch as well.  Note: the 
version of Diablo you are currently using is shown in the bottom 
corner of your main Diablo menu screen.

Now, to your battle.net connection problem.  I know it is 
frustrating, but, even though you may have the win95 version of AOL 
installed on your system, you may be using an older version of AOL 
when you connect (this can be the case if you've recently installed 
the win95 version).

If you've recently downloaded and run setup95.exe from AOL, then you 
will still have the older version on your computer, and you may be 
running the old version still (especially if you are using a win95 
shortcut to connect to AOL).  To make sure you are running the win95 
version of AOL when you connect, click on Start--Programs--America 
Online--then &#34;America Online for Windows 95&#34;.  Also make sure 
that you've clicked the &#34;connect now&#34; button (you must 
actually connect to AOL before you run Diablo).

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
