&#62; Dear helper i would like to know if it is posiable to find

&#62; Is light forge an item that you can find or is it a hack?

&#62; bring it in to b.net?


The Crusader, hydra, wyrms, vileness, and spikes adders were removed 
from the game before Diablo's release however some  are still on the 
CD and hackers have brought some of these items over. I have seen a 
Hydras Staff of Fireball that someone had but it is not possible to 
find it in the game as it was hacked into the game. Lightforge is a 
unique that was removed as well so if you see it in any form then it 
is a hack.

  Blizzard sais it is possible to find GPOW but i and others of my 
level(over level 46) have never even found a plain godly item or a 
whale item. The odds are definately against you to find these 
together in the dungeon since alot of us havent even seen a plain 
version of it. Wirt however regularly sells items with these adders 
and that is where most of the rare adders can be found. I don't think 
it would be possible to buy a GPOW over chain mail or so because it 
would cost too much for you to buy since you can only carry so much 
gold. The Full Plate versions you see have been hacked from the 
single player game where the pricing is different i think. Happy 
hunting. :)    Lonara</pre>
