&#62; &#62; &#62; I really doubt it that they put those monsters and the other quests 
&#62; &#62; &#62; on the disc and did not intended
&#62; &#62; &#62; to use them. Ok, the monsters do occupy relatively a small place, but 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the quests are taking at least
&#62; &#62; &#62; another 50Mb. We're talking about 3 or more quests which each 
&#62; &#62; &#62; character and each towner has
&#62; &#62; &#62; it's own Waves regarding the quest, and I assume some more graphics. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; It would be very stupid
&#62; &#62; &#62; to put on the disc things who won't be used. If it's just junk - then 
&#62; &#62; &#62; they could have saved space,
&#62; &#62; &#62; time and money on creating every disc. You don't pay studio time for 
&#62; &#62; &#62; recording without any intention
&#62; &#62; &#62; to use your material.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; See my point ?
&#62; &#62; &#62; And beside, some quests have a direct link to the story in the book.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I have been a programmer for 30 years and the answers by both helpers 
&#62; &#62; are correct.  They are just coming from different perspectives.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The New helpers comments are all valid from a programmers point of 
&#62; &#62; view,  The old helper is also correct when you interprete the word 
&#62; &#62; bug to included non functioning or incomplete code.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Just my 2 cents</pre>
