<pre>     Hello nice people !!! First , i'd like to thank you all for the 
great game you have created (Diablo) .
    I have been playing it since version 1.03  , and now ,  with this 
new version , i got some problems without answers.... I have been 
asking on battle.net for as many people as gave me attention , and no 
one could help me. So , here i am searching for some answers...
     A question: &#34; I have a char that i created while my Diablo 
was the 1.03 version , and that char has a healing spell that used to 
cost only 1 mana for casting it , but after i updated my version of 
Diablo for 1.04 , the cost for casting the healing spell is 19 mana 
!! Why that? &#34;
    Since my char is not a  hacked one , and i never touched none of 
the shrines that appear in the game ... i and most of the players on 
battle.net did not know the answer...
   Some people said me that it can be a bug for 1.04 version ... and 
would be better asking for you all directly, what knid of problem i'm 
having ...
   I would apreciate for everything anyone can do for helping me for 
solving this dilemma.....
  Since I'm from Brasil , and my english is not perfect , i'm asking 
for forgiving myr english as well as my type ... 
   Thanks for all of your efforts...</pre>
