&#62; Helper,
&#62; Thanks for the email its been a help but didnt work. I do know now 
&#62; that it IS my multiplayer characters (got 2 of them). I've backed up 
&#62; my single and multiplayer characters and totally re-installed, 
&#62; including the 1.04 patch. It works fine. Then I put my single player 
&#62; characters back in, still works fine. THEN I put my multi-play 
&#62; characters in, same problem again, crashes when click on multi-player 
&#62; option. So I know its my multiplayer characters, what now? You said 
&#62; they should restore back to normal once I put them back in the win 
&#62; folder, they didnt restore, just stuffed the game up again.
&#62; Is there a way to fix my characters? Should I just give up and start 
&#62; over?!?!?
&#62; 
&#62; Blizzard Support,
&#62; Your email NEVER arrived, please send again or post response.

Aceman,

The email I sent you described reinstalling Diablo, then, one by one, 
adding your multiplayer characters to see if one or more of them was 
causing the crash.  This appears to be the case, unfortunately.  
There is no way to fix a character that has been corrupted like this.

Did you try adding your multiplayer characters one at a time?  It 
could be that only one is causing the crash and, in this case, you 
would only have to lose the one character.  Add one of your 
characters, and see if the game crashes.  If it does not, then remove 
that character (saving it for later) and try another one.  Test each 
character in this way, making sure to remove characters from the 
previous test.  This way, you should be able to tell which characters 
are the rotten apples.  

After you know which characters are good, restore those and you 
should be able to play with them.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
