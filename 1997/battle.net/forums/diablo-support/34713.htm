&#62; Hi, how come when I log onto B-Net....Im just fine, but after like 5 
&#62; mins i go back to windows automatically? I need help please....And if 
&#62; its a bad thing....Im sorry I did it.. 
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. Im one of those people who worries alot...

Does it crash in the game or when your in a chat room? Anyways, hers 
some things you might want to try to fix your problem.

   1. Shut down extra programs. Hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and shut down 
everything except systray, explorer, and point32 if you have it. 
(Especially virus scanners.)

2. Make sure you have at least 20 megs of free hard drive space on 
your C: drive. I recommend at least 50 megs at least though. I would 
go for 100 megs if you can get it. Diablo needs this space free for 
virtual memory.

3. Make sure you have all the latest drivers.(Windows updates, Video, 
and sound drivers) There are lots of different links in the FAQ at 
the top of this forum you can use. Also, get the latest version of 
Direct X.(Currently 5).

4.Delete the contents of your Windows/Temp directory as there might 
be corrupt data there causing you trouble. Nothing vital will be in 
there so it's ok to delete it. (That's why it's a temp directory.) 

5. Run a Scandisk on your hard drive to fix errors. Also run defrag 
if it needs it as well.

6. If you only seem to have trouble with this trying to connect to 
battlenet then try deleting the bncache.dat file in the Diablo 
directory. It will be recreated next time you connect to battlenet 
and may fix your problem. You might also want to try removing 
battle.net  by using the Add/remove icon in the control panel. It 
will be reinserted next time you connect to battle.net(Corrupt free). 
This will change your account number so you might want to try it last 
if your picky about what act# you have.

I hope you get it fixed. However, if your still having trouble then 
post back with your system specs and any error messages that you get 
as it will make it easier for people here to help you.   Lonara</pre>
