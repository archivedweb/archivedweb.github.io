<pre>Hi Pat,

I think the problem I am having might be caused by the cable I am 
using.  It is a plain serial cable with a null modem adapter.  It 
works fine with Win95 DCC, Warcraft 2 and XvT.  Do I need to buy a 
null modem cable for Diablo to work, or should it work with the cable 
I am using?

I posted awhile back about problems I had with direct connection.  I 
had a problem with Diablo crashing as soon as I chose Direct 
Connection on either system.  Your advice was to check for IRQ 
conflicts.  Both systems had conflicts which have now been resolved.  
I'm having a different problem now.  I'm able to create a Direct 
Connect game on either system, but can't connect with the other 
system.  When I click retry connection on one system (with a direct 
connect game already running on the other system),  I get a message 
saying that no direct connect game was detected.  Here's info on the 
two systems.

Both are running Win95 w/Service pack 1, Kernel update and password 
update.  Both systems have different names.  Both systems have at 
least 400 MB of free HD space.

Packard Bell Pentium 120,  24 MB ram
Diamond Stealth 2000 (latest drivers installed)
Packard Bell Sound2 288SP sound card
modem on com1
serial cable on com2

The second system belongs to a friend.  The only thing I am not sure 
about is the sound card.  Under sound, video and game controllers in 
Device Manager, no sound card is listed; however, the sound on his 
system works fine in all programs including Diablo.

Cyrix P150+, 32 MB ram
STB Lightspeed 128 (latest drivers installed)
unknown sound card
serial mouse on com3
serial cable on com4

Scott

ps:  Thanks for the quick reply on my last post.</pre>
