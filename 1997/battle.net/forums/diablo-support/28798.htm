<pre>Blizzard,

I am one of the many people that feel something weird has happened to 
item generation. The dungeons just don't generate anything as good as 
they used to generate when I was 15-20 levels lower fighting wimps.  
I never have seen certain items I saw in the early days. In fact, the 
best items that I have are from Diablo 1.00 and 1.01 that my 25th (at 
that time) level rogue found ... she started finding tons of +30&#37; 
resist all and +30 to magic, and awesome plate of sorcery, and 
similar stuff. Then a number of days after I hit a level where I was 
regularly turning up quality stuff, some patch (1.02? 1.03?) changed 
that. NOW, my level 42 mage and my level 33 rogue and my level 31 
fighter are still having to depend on the 3-4 rings and armors I 
found way back then, since the generator hasn't turned out anything 
better. I have played them all  in normal/hell, nightmare/hell or 
hell/hell for 42 levels of sorcerer, 8 MORE rogue levels and 31 
fighter levels. Has something happened to the item generation? Did 
something get broken or were the odds tweaked? Some item types don't 
appear at all.

I am going to try an Experiment, and I hope some of you will too. I 
happen to have access to a 2nd computer that DOES NOT yet have Diablo 
on it, and it isn't on the internet. I'm gonna install Diablo 1.0 and 
play a mage to level 40, and see what items I can find. If I 
regularly get rockin' treasure, then we will know something has 
changed. If I don't, well, I'll have a level 40 mage on another 
machine I can play with. :) And, I'll have fun. :) BUT, if I get 
great items regularly, we will know something IS currently broken.

If anyone does the same experiment, report your findings here, since, 
in my opinion, this is a technical problem or error in the game 
(until and unless I conclude I'm just imagining things). IF Blizzard 
HAS tweaked the odds for any reason, I wish they would just say so; 
it would be OK. If they haven't, I hope this idea will show that 
either there IS a technical problem or that I AM imagining things. :)
