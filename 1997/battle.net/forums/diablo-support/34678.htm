<pre>T'kron,

I downloaded win95 service pack 1 and the kernel 32 update for my 
work machine.  It was a 3.1 box that I upgraded to win95.  It is now 
in a dual boot config, win3.1 and win95, you know for those customers 
that just won't switch.  When I applied the service pack it did not 
upgrade my serial number, also the kernel 32 update did not match 
what it said would in the docs at the MS site. 

I have looked around, sniffed my machine, kicked it a couple of 
times, and said, well, I applied the crap, it should work.  If I were 
you, I would not try and install service pack 1, just install the 
password fix update, kernel 32 update and the nuke patch, make sure 
you have the latest version of the nuke patch.  See if that works.  
Good luck

&#62; Here is a wierd one.
&#62; Monday morning when I tried to dial into my ISP it kept saying my 
&#62; password was invalid. After 2 hours on the phone, with everyone but 
&#62; me being able to log on using my id to my ISP. I decided to reload 
&#62; windows 95 over itself.
&#62; 
&#62; Immediately I was able to log onto my ISP.
&#62; 
&#62; When I tried to install service pack 1, it would run but would not 
&#62; update my release number to an xxx xxx  xxxa.
&#62; 
&#62; When I instaled the patches kernal patch ole patch (wouldn't load)
&#62; a couple of other patches wouldn't load the nuke patches. while I was 
&#62; still logged up, I could connect to my ISP.  When I powered down my 
&#62; machine.  and turned it back on, I could no longer connect to my ISP 
&#62; with then same password problem. 
&#62; 
&#62; I kept reinstalling windows and service pack 1 and after each install 
&#62; would power down power up and connect to my ISP, then try the next 
&#62; patch power down, back up connect to ISP.  I kept trying it until I 
&#62; installed a patch where I couldn't connect to my ISP.
&#62; 
&#62; Two patches seemed to be the cuplrit the password patch 
&#62; (Mspwlupd.exe) and the second nuke patch (vipupd.exe).  I  even tried 
&#62; downloading new versions of the patches but had the same result.
&#62; 
&#62; My machine worked fine with all patches installed for about 2 months.
&#62; 
&#62; I cannot fully install the service pack 1 to where my release number 
&#62; reflects that it is installed
&#62; the following patches will not install at all: backupd2.exe 
&#62; dsktsupd.exe secupd.exe and the ole patch whatever the full name is. 
&#62; they all come back with an error and never fully install.
&#62; 
&#62; I have reinstalled windows about 7 times and currently have just the 
&#62; reinstalled Win95  loaded on my machine.  And I can get on my ISP.
&#62; 
&#62; I downloaded Mcafee's trial version of their virus scan, and my 
&#62; machine has no viruses.
&#62; 
&#62; Anybody have any Ideas.  If I can't get on my ISP I can't answer 
&#62; questions here or ge on Battlenet.  ( I am doing this at work)
&#62; 
&#62; And If i cant install the service pac and all the patches, I am 
&#62; running with an unstable machine subject to nukes and  other woes 
&#62; that the patches are supposed to fix.
&#62; 
&#62; My machine is 3 and 1/2 years old and was an upgraded from win3.1 to 
&#62; Win95 in May of this year.
&#62; 
&#62; As far as I can tell all other non communication software is working 
&#62; ok.
&#62; 
&#62; And I can dialup to work using PcAnywhere and Crosstalk both of which 
&#62; do not use TCP/IP
&#62; 
&#62; Any suggestions/solutions would be appreciated.</pre>
