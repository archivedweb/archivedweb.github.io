&#62; first things first:
&#62; 
&#62; 1. i was never complaining to blizzard.

Sure sounded like it to me.

&#62; 
&#62; 2. i would never ask for, expect or use any help from blizzard.

If you did not want or expect help, why were you posting in the tech 
support forum?  

&#62; 
&#62; 3. blizzard has made a really great game. i dont fault them for that.

Say it again brother!

&#62; 
&#62; 4. the reason i posted in here was to inform other users with the 
&#62; same    problem, not to have it out with people like you.
&#62; 

If you are trying to help with Diablo technical problems, you are 
welcome in the forum, if you are trying to tell people that there 
game might get screwed up if they hex edit the files, you are stating 
the obvious.

&#62; 5. i am NOT 12 years old.
&#62; 

Nothing wrong with being 12 years old.

&#62; the entire reason i cheat is not to ruin the game for me or anyone 
&#62; else. it is because i want to enhance it. certain cheats dont affect 
&#62; game at all. i use these. here is a list of cheats that i currently 
&#62; use:

That is perfectly fine, I think Blizzard does not address cheats like 
that because they realize some people will play longer if they can 
give themselves a little advantage.

&#62; 
&#62; God mode from other players.
&#62; 
&#62; i use this, not to pk, but to prevent from being pk'ed. i know what 
&#62; your going to say, i've heard it from blizzard hundreds of times 
&#62; before: &#34;if you play with someone you know in private games you 
&#62; wouldn't need it.&#34; for me, private games violate the entire 
&#62; purpose of battle.net, as you are prevented from meeting people that 
&#62; you DON'T know and getting to know them and how they play. after all, 
&#62; how are you supposed to know  someone if you've never played with 
&#62; them before. None of my real life friends (yes i do have some) either 
&#62; can't play battle.net, or won't, so i find new friends online, 
&#62; through gaming. if you had taken the time to read my entire message, 
&#62; you would have noticed that my BROTHER used the inventory hack, not 
&#62; me. the simple fault that almost all 'pure' players is that this 
&#62; purism does not extend into real life: if they had found 100$ they 
&#62; would surely take it without a second thought, but in their controled 
&#62; world online, freebies are unheard of! how DARE another person use 

&#62; the equivilent of a get-rich-quick sceme! oh, and about your comment 
&#62; that if i had asked they would have told me. absoloutly no way. i 
&#62; have asked and asked again, but to the response that i didn't need 
&#62; to know. 

I don't know who you are trying to fool with this statement here, it 
is ridiculous, I e-mailed Blizzard about a month ago on where the 
multiplayer files were and I received a prompt response.  They did 
not know who I was when I did, I could of been you, you are not 
speaking true here.

&#62;trust me, battle.net's time is up, and im not going to ever see 
&#62; you 'purists' again, as im not going to play UO. anyone who uses any 
&#62; program i make is free to change it as they like. if blizzard had 
&#62; included the cheats in the game like warcraft 2(which is the perfect 
&#62; solution, in my eyes, some cheats, but with no god mode), they 
&#62; wouldn't have half the problem with hacks as they do now. expect no 
&#62; more posts from me on this subject, but i will read responses.

If you think Battle.net's time is up you are seriously misinformed.  
Starcraft is coming out soon and it will be on Battle.net along with 
Diablo.  Battle.net has already been heralded a stunning success by 
much of the gaming industry and a whole lot of gamers.  Other 
companies are starting the online service also, but Battle.net is 
free.  I think Blizzard struck a serious blow to you cheaters in the 
ver 1.04 patch, and you are still crying about it, even the creators 
of the cheats and hacks you use got so fed up with you guys they told 
Blizzard what to do to stop them.  If you don't want to play on 
Battle.net any more, fine, you are just depriving yourself.

Nuff Said,
