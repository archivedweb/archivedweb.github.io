<pre>Blizzard Tech-Support I've been reading the forum pages for the past 
week now and I have been noticing one problem that keeps on showing 
up. The illegal operation deal. Well guess what my problem is the 
illegal operation deal. I have emailed Blizzard Tech-Support and the 
sent me back a list of things to try and none of them had seemed to 
work. Then I tried unistalling battle.net then deleting all my temps 
files in C:\Windows\Temp then I went to play the game and an it still 
crashed with the illegal operation. Oh yeah, I also deleted 
bncache.dat and that didn't work. 

This problem presist in Multiplayer games, on b-net and modem not 
sure about network but I would think so, and I signle player games. 
In my single player games I wil be in the dugeons and it will just 
crash and also in my multiplayer games.

Well if you guys could figure this problem out many people I think 
would be happy. Oh yeah I have also d/led my newest drivers and 
DirectX which I was told DirectX 3.0a. 

That's all I have to say. I would appreaciate it if you guys could 
work on fixing or giving me something else to try.
