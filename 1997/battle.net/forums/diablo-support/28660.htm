<blockquote>
<pre>Yes, the answer from the Blizzard guys was kind of ... not completely 
satisfying.

We should ask them more precise questions:

- are there suffixes/prefixes in the multi-player game which _cannot 
be found_ ?

Reason for this question: Nobody I know (and I know a lot of people 
playing Diablo...) have _ever_ found anything holy / godly.
You (Blizzard) said that the fact nobody found such items does not 
mean they cannot be found, but merely that they are very rare. 
This sounds convincing at first, but when the game uses normally 
increasing rarity for increasing suffixes/prefixes, then you should 
be able to find something (anything - a simple holy buckler for 
example) holy/godly at least at the rate of, say, a ring of the 
zodiac (which also is extremely rare). It does not have to be a godly 
plate of the whale - simple &#34;holy rags&#34; would be enough. I 
find lots of &#34;awesome&#34; items - helms, shields, anything. But 
no &#34;holy&#34; anything, although holy is the next prefix after 
&#34;awesome&#34; and although I have played five characters to 
levels after 40. Strange, isn't it ?

- Are there any special combinations of suffixes/prefixes and item 
classes which do not exist ? 
I simply would like to know if, for example, the prefixes after 
&#34;warrior's&#34; can be found in conjunction with a bow. There is 
a warrior's bow in the multiplayer game, I have seen it (legit). But 
nobody has ever seen a king's bow or even a lord's bow (which really 
should not be that rare, considering the &#34;to hit&#34; / 
&#34;damage&#34; - bonus it would have - far under the 
&#34;Eaglehorn&#34; which is found really often). 

I do not think giving the answers to these questions would spoil the 
game. In fact, it would be unfair to leave thousands of players 
searching and searching for the famous godly plate of the whale (or 
even a simple holy plate, ac 75) if you _knew_ that such items simply 
do not exist in multi-player (cannot be found in the dungeon, to 
expensive to be sold by wirt...). </pre>
