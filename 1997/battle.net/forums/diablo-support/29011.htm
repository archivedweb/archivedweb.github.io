<pre>On Thu Jul 17 16:58, Thank You for answering  wrote:
&#62; I posted these questions earlier and you were very kind in your
&#62; response, but now I will dscribe the circumstances a little better.
&#62; 
&#62; 1. &#60;MULTIPLAYER GAME / SOLO, IPX &#62;
&#62;    My problem was, that more than once, as I was fighting Laz et.al.
&#62; I was hit by a fireball (with full health and full Mana shield), which
&#62; killed me in one shot (not a small feat). When I restarted in town, 
&#62; I was still wearing all of my equipment! strange, yes?
&#62; 
&#62;    This might be related- again, more than once, as I killed everyone
&#62; but Laz, I enter his room and he doesn't react! He just stands there,
&#62; following me with his head, but not reacting. If I shoot arrows, they 
&#62; pass right through him! only when I touch him by walking right up to 
&#62; his face does he wake up. What I have done, on occasion, is Stone 
&#62; curse him, but like I said my arrows miss, until I stand toe-to-toe,
&#62; when he shakes off the curse immediately and lays into me.
&#62;    Now, I thought you might be sceptical, so I grabbed a screen shot 
&#62; of me, standing near enough to see the color of Laz's eyes, and my 
&#62; golem is walking away from him (apparently my golem's can't hurt him 
&#62; in this state either).
&#62; 
&#62;         Lastly, this has only happened once, : I dropped a port in an 
&#62; Empty room, (empty!).  I returned to town, then back thru the portal,
&#62; BUT, I was in a room FULL of knights and drakes and soul burners. 
&#62; (who very quickly finished me off as I had no time to even through up 
&#62; Mana shield.
&#62; 
&#62;         Ok, this is really &#34;lastly&#34; :  It is also true that 
&#62; on another occasion, as I emerged onto the dungeon through my portal, 
&#62; I right clicked to teleport, but I ended up not 40 feet away, but 
&#62; 400. (the other side of the level)  Now, as I was walking INTO the 
&#62; port, I moved  the cursor (that cute little hand) into the top right 
&#62; corner of the screen (because that is where I had just died so my 
&#62; stuff was waiting for me), and the moment I saw the dungeoin appear 
&#62; on my screen, I clicked.
&#62; 
&#62;        So, I hope these questions are better now that they are more 
&#62; descriptive.
&#62; 
&#62; Thank you.

Thank You,

Yes, it is strange that you were killed in one hit by a creature's 
fireball with full health and mana shield.  The most common cause for 
this would be that you were actually killed by another player, but, 
because you were in a solo game, this could not be the case.

The next reason that would explain this (though I am a bit doubtful) 
is that you did _not_ have you mana shield going when you were hit.  
This could have happened if you had lost your mana shield previously, 
then drank a mana potion, but forgot to bring up your mana shield 
again.  This would make you much more vulnerable to those fireballs.  
However, if this was the case, you should still have a full mana ball 
when you died.  When you restarted in town, you mana ball would be 
emtpy, but do you remember if it was empty when you actually died.  
If it was not, then perhaps you forgot to cast mana shield after you 
lost it.

The phenonmenon you experienced when you returned to Lazarus after 
goin to town is normal, actually.  If you kill all or some of 
Lazarus' minions, then leave that level, Lazarus will go back to 
&#34;sleep.&#34;  You will not be able to attack him again until he 
has been &#34;woken up&#34; again.  In this case, he will not wake up 
until you touch him (so get that Stone Curse ready :)

On rare occasions, your town portal can change it's destination after 
you've used it to go to town.  This is very rare, however, so I would 
not worry about it happening again.

Your teleport problem is strange.  I can't explain why your teleport 
spell might not take you to where you were pointing, but, if it 
happens again, can you send your system specifications and a 
description of this to support@blizzard.com?  We'll see if we can't 
figure out what caused this.

Thanks,
pat N.</pre>
