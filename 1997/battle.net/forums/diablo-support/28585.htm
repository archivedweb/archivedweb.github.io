<pre>I have been playing quite alot, so have been my friends, most of us 
have several level 40+ characters and we noticed one very interesting 
thing:
 You can find items with ONLY suffixes and prefixes which handled by 
either Grizwold or Adria. There are several suffixes and prefixes 
which are just impossible to find and only way to obtain them is to 
buy them from Wirt. Since Grizwold does not sell Emerald items, it 
seemed at first that this may be wrong, but Adria does sell emerald 
staffs!So there are list of suffixes and prefixes which are not sold 
by neither Adria nor Grizwold and which cannot be found in Labirinth:
Strange
Wierd
Ruthless
Mersiless
Mammoth
Whales
Holy
Godly
Thunder
Burning
Slaughter

there may be several more I don't remeber. However, I noticed that 
NONE of above prefixes were NEVER found by me nor by my friends in 
Labirinth. Now, it may be not important to you, but to folks who 
still play Diablo and consider themselves Legit players it is 
important!
We noticed that Wirt keep his prices in 140,000 range, i.e he never 
sells anything for over 140,000 gold! Nor does Grizwold. So since 
Wirt never sells anything CHEAPER then Grizwold, it is impossible to 
obtain things such as Godly Plate of the whales legit way, no matter 
how many times you lurk into &#34;Deeper levels of dungeon&#34;, 
because those items just cannot be found! Where is GPOW's coming 
from? Well I asked folks who played Single player game and they told 
me that pricing policy in Single player mode is DIFFERENT, in fact 
EVERYTHING is about 25&#37; of what it usually cost in 
multyplayer!Now if you hack your SINGLE player character to level for 
example 99 and then add unlimited gold hack you will only have to buy 
item each time you visit wirt! Eventually you will be able to BUY 
GPOW from him! I was assured that there are cheat programs which 
allow you to transfer items from single player to multy player. Well 
I already knew that! Since there is SO many items which can be found 
only in multyplayer.. anyway
QUESTION IS:
Am I right and GPOW was hacked from single player mode?
P.S. I would also love to know if there is Veil of Steel in 
multiplayer game, I never found it , but some folks I asked said THEY 
did!</pre>
