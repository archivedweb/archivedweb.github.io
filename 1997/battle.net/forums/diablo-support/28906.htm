&#62; Pat,

&#62;    Based on what you told me my rogue friend & I did an
&#62; experiment & the result was odd.  We trapped Diablo in the
&#62; maze, wrote down our current experience points #, & brought
&#62; Diablo out.
&#62;    My rogue friend landed 2 hits to Diablo with a sword,
&#62; then backed off. Then I (Warrior) took over, & killed Diablo
&#62; with many hits, had to be at least 15 before he died.
&#62;    When we compared our experience point changes afterward,
&#62; the result was I received 8000 experience points & he
&#62; received 8600, even though he hit Diablo only twice.
&#62; BTW, we were in NM Hell & my friend hit Diablo first,
&#62; I after. We haven't tried this with any other creatures yet.
&#62;    So my question is, why the point difference, considering
&#62; I did all but 2 of the hits?  If 2 players hit the same
&#62; monster, are experience experience points split 50/50 and a
&#62; bonus given to whoever struck first?  Or are points divided
&#62; in a different way?
&#62;    This my seem like splitting hairs (or points) but I play
&#62; co-op exclusively, so the information would be very helpful
&#62; in letting each co-oper share points as evenly as possible.
&#62;    Yours & the Helper's assistance has always been much
&#62; appreciated be me & many, many others.

Stretch,

Your bring up some interesting facts, and, honestly, I don't know why 
the amount of experience you received for killing Diablo differed 
from that of your friend.  I understand that this type of information 
would be important to someone that does a lot of Co-op play, but the 
difference in points gained between two players that both took part 
in killing a creature does not seem great -- your multiplayer 
strategies can still be based on &#34;equal&#34; experience for each 
player.

Wish I could help more, 
Pat N.</pre>
