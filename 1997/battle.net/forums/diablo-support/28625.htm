&#62; OK, I get into battle.net, find someone with 2 green bars who says I 
&#62; also show two green bars meaning lag is good.  We start a game and 
&#62; about 20 minutes into the game I get hourglasses and then get booted 
&#62; out.  This happens over and over.  Is it my ISP (Pacific Bell) or is 
&#62; it my computer (Pentium 75 with 4 speed CD ROM?)  If it's my ISP, 
&#62; then 
&#62; please suggest fast ISP in Los Angeles area.  Thanks.  

Lorena,

The problem could be rooted in your machine, but I'm going to guess 
that it is an internet problem.

To be sure, make sure your modem is using the following settings:

Click on Start -- settings -- control panel
Open Modem
click on Modem
select properties
select the connection tab
select Advanced
make sure that Use Flow Control is selected and set it to Hardware
Turn on Error Control -- select Compress Data
Click OK
click on the Port Settings button
click on the default button
click OK


Your latency with another person can change with time, and this can 
cause you to be booted from a game even if, when you started the 
game, your latency to it was low.  Here is what you should do:

Try playing at a time when your ISP is not too busy (perhaps later at 
night?).  This will help with your latency, and should give you more 
success with your games.

See if other people are joining the game you are playing.  If a third 
or fourth person joins the game, then your latency with them could be 
give you the problems you're having.

When you are booted from the game, are you losing your concection to 
your ISP?  If you are, then you should make sure you do not have your 
&#34;disconnect when idle&#34; box checked in your Internet Control 
Panel:
click on Start--Settings--control, panel
Open Internet
select the connection tab
uncheck the &#34;disconnect when idle&#34; check box

If you have further questions, repost here or send email to 
support@blizzard.com

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
