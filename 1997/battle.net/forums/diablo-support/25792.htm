&#62; I have been playing DIABLO since It was originally released.  I have
&#62; about 6 chars that are level 33 +  all are legit and have 3 dots..
&#62; 
&#62; What I want to know is...  Is there a reason for me to keep playing ??
&#62; 
&#62; I know this sounds like a strange question..  I like playing for the 
&#62; items,  its what keeps me going..  The hope that I will find 
&#62; something better than what I am using.   
&#62; 
&#62; Will I find better items than what I have ?  Example,  My rogue has 
&#62; eaglehorn&windforce ( are there kings bows ?)..   I have ac75 awesome 
&#62; plate (does holy/godly plate exist ?)..  
&#62; 
&#62; Keep in mind that i play only multi-player games (b.net)..  Throw me 
&#62; a 
&#62; bone..  tell me there is alot better stuff if i keep working at it.  
&#62; I would imagine at the point where I am, i am gonna need to find 
&#62; these things instead of buy them due to the fast they would cost more 
&#62; than could be bought  (the most $$ thing i have seen is in the 130k-
&#62; 140k range)
&#62; 
&#62; Do I look in hell/hell ??  or does normal/hell have just as good of 
&#62; stuff ?
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for any info you can give..  
&#62;

I know what you mean.  Between myself and 3 of my friends (who live 
near me, so I have actually seen their characters) have amassed over 
1 billion experience points, all legit (4 level 40+, 6 level 30+).  
In all that game play, not one of us has found Godly/Holy Plate 
(Though I have found Godly Ring Mail).  Neither have we found a 
King's Bow (But I have found a Soldier's Bow).  I have found 1 
Obsid/Zodiac (would love another one).  As I understand the item 
generation rules (And this has been confirmed by Blizzard), because I 
have found a Soldier's Bow then it is possible to find a King's Bow 
(Because Soldier's and King's are the same type of prefix).  Of 
course this would also mean that you could find Emerald Rings or 
Strange Rings (I'd love one of these) or some kind of Armor of the 
Zodiac.  But, to be honest... I'm tired of looking.
