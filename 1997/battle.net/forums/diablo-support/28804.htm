<pre>It's like you run a hex-editor while running diablo(even hexing 
something other than diablo) and diablo crashes. You'd think they 
could just say something &#34;We caught you cheating.&#34; and stop 
what you were trying to do. but no, it's &#34;We caught you cheating, 
now we're gonna crash your computer. HAHAHAHAHA.&#34; i mean they 
spend thousands of hours trying to figure out why YOUR COMPUTER needs 
to be fuked up. there worse than then little adolestent hackers bent 
on destroying all computers. one time my brother and i had four 
inventories FULL of LEGIT items we FOUND and my brother didn't want 
to get rid of his items(he ran out of room) so he used a hack so the 
items only took one space in the inventory. Well blizzard decided 
that we didn't need all those items we spent months collecting, and 
that we didn't have to know where the problem file was! blizzard wont 
disclose where it saves charector files on YOUR computer. they're 
response to any problems is &#34;uninstall and reinstall. the 
charectors lost is YOUR fault.&#34; well i hope some blizzard lackee 
reads this because im pissed. well i found the save files and im not 
holding back. the single player save files are saved in the diablo 
directory and there really not hard to find &#34;save_0.sv&#34; i 
think, but i haven't played single player for a while. the 
multiplayer files are little bit more complicated, and are kept in 
the windows directory with the names &#34;dlinfo_0.drv&#34;-
&#34;dlinfo_10.drv&#34; depending on how many multiplayer chars you 
have. if you have the problem where everytime you click on 
multiplayer on the main menu, diablo crashes, it's probably one of 
your chars(incorrect placement, altered attributes etc.) so, you 
figured out what's wrong, now what do you do?
well first and formost, DO NOT goto blizzard or ask ANY blizzard 
employee. they hate cheats and think that you should pay by 
uninstalling your diablo chars. they get ALOT of fun messing with 
cheaters(personal experiance[telling them that it laughable to cheat, 
making fun of them, banning them, and basically not caring at all, 
even though half of all questions are cheat-related{the rest are from 
newbies that don't know how to press F1}]) and should NOT be trusted. 
i have been told MANY times to re-install diablo by ignorant blizzard 
techs. the main fact is, blizzard knows less about how the hackers 
cheat than the hackers know about diablo. if they left diablo up to 
the (RESPONSIBLE)hackers (see raymond's diablo page) almost every 
single problem would be solved within days. but no, we cant let the 
people with REAL intelligence take care of things because they might 
make our little baby easier for newbies!</pre>
