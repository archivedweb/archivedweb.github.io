I have sent you E-mail regarding this, I don't usually send E-Mail 
but I remember you.  Here is it posted in the forum just in case you 
don't get it.

Hello, 

The Helper here,  you need to contact your cable modem service and
verify that they are not restricting TCP packets on ports 116 and 118,
those ports have to be open for in/out TCP packets.  Port 6112 has to 
be open for in/out UDP packets.  Ask them if those ports are open, if 
they are not, try and convince them to do it so you can play Diablo.  
The TCP packets look like they are not making it in your case, if it 
was just the UDP packets, you would be able to get on Battle.net, but 
you would only be able to chat.

If they are not restricting those ports,  you need to answer this
question, what you will do next will depend on the answer.  Have you
ever been able to play Diablo with that setup before?

If the answer is yes, 

Uninstall Battle.net, not Diablo from My Computer - Control Panel - 
Add/Remove Programs - Battle.net and remove.

Then go to your Diablo folder and verify that the file BNCACHE.DAT is
gone, if it is not, delete it.

Delete the contents of your Windows Temp Folder

Try Diablo again.  If it still does not work follow the advice below.

If you have never been able to play Diablo before, you might want to
find out how to manually ping the battle.net server.  A ping is a 
signal sent by your computer to a server, one you specify.  The 
server will answer the ping and you can tell if you have a connection 
to that
server.  If you find out that your connection is blocked some way, 
tell your ISP that your not able to ping the server and see what the 
deal is.  I am sorry I cannot tell you any more about the ping 
utility, I have never used it but I know the concept.  You will 
probably have to get the server address from Blizzard.  I suggest you 
E-Mail Blizzard Tech Support for this information

support@blizzard.com

Hope this helps,

The Helper

P.S.  The program that sends the ping is called ping.exe, it usually 
is located in your windows folder.  I am sorry but I don't know how 
to work it.</pre>
