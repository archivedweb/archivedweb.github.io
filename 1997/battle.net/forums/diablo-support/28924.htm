<pre>Yes Godly plates with account over 50 are hacks from Single player 
game, same thing we can tell about holy Plates with ac over 60, they 
are DEFINETELY hacks.. here is an explanation about &#34;CHANCES&#34; 
about which Blizzard tech support continues to BS everybody, 
hopefully because they have NO idea by themselves... anyway, here u 
go, since it's SO rare to find Godly item, let's for aminute suppose 
that it's actually exist... then we will have to say that possibility 
to find it  well.. like.. 1/200000, now, Whales items SAME rare with 
Godly, i.e. basically NONEXISTENT(we are talking about FINDING them, 
not buying from Wirt, where they fairly common), Now, Even Plates of 
Sorcery are more common(in fact they are most common plates) So why 
the heck best plate of Sorcery is Awesome not godly? Simple, because 
Wirt does NOT sell Sorcery suffix! According to Blizzard's math for 
EACH GPOW there should be like 50 Godly plates of Sorcery, 30 plates 
of Gigants, 25 plates of harmony 22 plates of Vigor and 23 plates of 
precision... HOWEVER... ONLY versions of Godly plate EVER existed 
are: Ages, Osmosis, Mammoth, Whale and.... Ya.. Lion.. I saw new 
Godly plate recently.. anyway, Those are all suffixes RARE or 
impossible to find(excluding ages and may be harmony) compare to for 
example sorcery.. so just relax.. unless Godly plates come ONLY in 
complect with suffix WHALES Blizzard is full of sh*t, or at least his 
representatives on this board(no offense guys, but U don't really 
seem to know what the hell u talking about.. take King's bow for 
example or emerald jewelry...) Now U wanna ask WHERE is GPOW came 
from? Well here u go my friend: SINGLE PLAYER, if you play it you may 
notice that items in Single player mode cost CHEAPER then in multy! 
So all U have to do is to create single player character, hack it to 
level about 50 and then make unlimited gold hack, why u need level 
50? So wirt offers you kewl stuff, anyway after u did so, u just buy 
item and go down, come up, buy item and go down, since there is a 
difference in pricing, it's POSSIBLE to see Godly plate of the whales 
from wirt, it will cost about 80K from him in Single player mode, 
compare to 240K in multy! Anyway after u bought your GPOW, you only 
have to transfer it to mp character.... There are plenty of hacks for 
it.. and NO I never used hacks and never will, I have 7 fully legit 
characters and NEVER FOUND single Godly or Mammoth's item. I found 
like 100 awesome plates though... I made this post to shut up whinees 
who say: Wheeeee... GPOW is not a hack.. it's just rare.. well It's a 
hack.. sorry boys...</pre>
