<pre>On Wed Jul 16 16:46, Thank you wrote:
&#62; 1. More than once this has occured to me. As I am fighting the 
&#62; creatures inside Laz's Den, I have been killed when Mana Shield
&#62; is up and health is full, by a single fireball. Now this isn't that 
&#62; wierd, BUT, when I restart in town, I haven't lost the equipment that 
&#62; was on my person.  This is very odd, no?
&#62; 
&#62; 2. This particular glitch has caused me too lose my equipment more 
&#62; than once as well. Once, I went back down through my own town portal
&#62; which was on lvl 15, and instead of coming out where I has left it,
&#62; I had appeared in a totally different room (surrounded of course).
&#62; I died in that spot and could not hack my way through the layers of 
&#62; creatures to reach my equipment.
&#62;     Then, more recently, as I emerged from my portal onto lvl 15, I 
&#62; immediately right clicked in order to teleport away only about 40 
&#62; feet, no more. Unfortunately, I didn't end up 40 feet away, but 4000 
&#62; feet away, totally on the other side of the level. Again I died and 
&#62; this time again could not hack my way all the way thru the level.
&#62; 
&#62; Can you explain why this happens?
&#62; 
&#62; on the side, I was wondering if it is possible to FIND items that 
&#62; have 
&#62; the prefixes that Wirt sometimes offfers? Merciless, Godly etc..
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Thank you for this great game! (and a response to this I hope  *grin*)

Thanks,

-When you were in Lazarus' room, was there another player nearby?  
Someone may have hit you with one of their fireballs.  This could 
have killed you (fireballs can be pretty nasty), and would be the 
reason you did not lose your gear.  When you are killed by another 
player, you only lose half of your gold and one of your ears (you do 
not lose your equipment).

-Your second problem does sound a bit strange.  On rare occurences, 
when you go to the dungeon via your Town Portal, the dungeon may 
appear different than what you remembered.  If this happens, try 
leaving the dungeon level, and entering it again through the stairs --
 this should fix things.

If your teleport spell malfuntions like you report again, can you 
repost here or send email to support@blizzard.com?  Give us your 
system specifications, and explain the glitch one more time.  I have 
not heard of this problem before, and it was probably just a random 
memory glitch (make sure you are not running any extra programs when 
you play Diablo).  It if happens again, however, please report it 
again -- we'll look into it.

-Lastly, yes, it is possible to find items with prefixes/suffixes 
that are commonly offered by Wirt, though this prefixes/suffixes are 
very rare in the dungeon.  Keep looking on levels 13-16, and you may 
get lucky :)

Thanks,
pat N.</pre>
