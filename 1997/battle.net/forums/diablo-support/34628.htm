&#62; I really doubt it that they put those monsters and the other quests 
&#62; on the disc and did not intended
&#62; to use them.

they were INTENDED to be used, but with time constaints in getting 
the game on the shelf, the actual CODE required to make them part of 
the game could not be finished in time and was deactivated.


&#62; Ok, the monsters do occupy relatively a small place, but 
&#62; the quests are taking at least
&#62; another 50Mb. We're talking about 3 or more quests which each 
&#62; character and each towner has
&#62; it's own Waves regarding the quest, and I assume some more graphics. 

It would cost blizzard MORE to remove the all of the related objects 
that are not used than it would to leave them in the game and 
deactivate them because they were not finished. When you remove code 
from a program, you always run the risk of removing by accident a 
useful set of logic therefore causing the ENTIRE program to not work 
correctly. It is easier, and therefore more cost effective, to just 
remove the access to the unfinished code.



&#62; It would be very stupid
&#62; to put on the disc things who won't be used. If it's just junk - then 
&#62; they could have saved space,
&#62; time and money on creating every disc. You don't pay studio time for 
&#62; recording without any intention
&#62; to use your material.
&#62; 
&#62; See my point ?

No. see above.


&#62; And beside, some quests have a direct link to the story in the book.
True, again the INTENT was there, but the code just couldn't be 
completed on time so it was removed and the book wasn't completly re-
written to reflect this.

HAVING the extra stuff there actually helped make the add-on HELLFIRE 
possible as it will make use of a lot of the unused code and monsters.
