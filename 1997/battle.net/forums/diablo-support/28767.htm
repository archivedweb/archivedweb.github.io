&#62; I have noticed several recurring themes and would like to post this
&#62; as an answer to some of them remember if you have questions after 
&#62; reading or are still confused ask BLIZZARD.  If you think some of 
&#62; this is wrong again ask BLIZZARD or please reply and I will change 
&#62; it. 
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  I dont know why Blizzard will not just post this in their FAQ 
&#62; because of the many cheats that are loose that mess peoples systems
&#62; up but here is how you transfer characters from one computer to 
&#62; another:
&#62; 
&#62;  Look in your windows dir and copy the file(s) dlinfo_*.drv (* is a 
&#62; wildcard) to diskette.  open MY COMPUTER select NETWORK select VIEW 
&#62; then OPTIONS then IDENTIFICATION and make sure that the name of the 
&#62; computer which you are transferring to is the same as that which you 
&#62; are transferring from.  copy the dlinfo_*.drv to the windows dir on 
&#62; the new computer.  To view hidden files select MY COMPUTER,  right 
&#62; click on VIEW, OPTIONS, VIEW, then 
&#62; select SHOW ALL FILES,  select OK.
&#62; 
&#62; 2. there is no secret COW LEVEL its a SNIPE HUNT
&#62; 
&#62; 3. Duping is cheating
&#62; 
&#62; 4. dont cheat using hacks it can only lead to unstable systems and 
&#62; possible viruses BLIZZARD will not support hacks.
&#62; 
&#62; 5. Please dont SPAM I dont buy it in the grocery why would I want it 
&#62; here.
&#62; 
&#62; 6. my working definition of cheating and hacking:  Cheating is when 
&#62; you use an outside program to influence another program in a way 
&#62; unintended by the original author.  restoring a backed up character 
&#62; if your game crashed on you in B.Net is not cheating but restoring 
&#62; just because you got your Butt Kicked is.  Hacking is creating 
&#62; outside programs to influence another program outside of its intended 
&#62; parameters.
&#62; 
&#62; 7. you cannot change the name of your character nor transfer them 
&#62; from multi to single and vice versa without cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; 8. Lvl 50 is the highest level.
&#62; 
&#62; 9. shareware and full version are not compatable on B.net
&#62; 
&#62; 10. The lights next to your name on B.net represents computer lag 
&#62; green is good red is bad.
&#62; 
&#62; 11. Read BLIZZARD's FAQ
&#62; 
&#62; If you find any of this wrong please post and i will change it thanks.
&#62; 
&#62;

&#62; PS this is my last Post for two weeks ill be gone till the first of 
&#62; the month or so, visiting relatives, see ya when i get back. </pre>
