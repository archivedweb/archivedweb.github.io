&#62; whenever i go into diablo, and try to go into multiplayer games it 
&#62; kicks me out to my start page. with the following error message:
&#62; diablo caused an invalid page fault in module diablo.exe at 
&#62; 0137:0042df28.  i was on line playing when it kicked me out and then 
&#62; i couldn't even go into multiplayer games at all. i have been playing 
&#62; for months, so it isn't that my system wont play it. i tried 
&#62; reinstalling it and even trying to go into version 1.00 multiplayer 
&#62; and it wouldn't let me. please help if you can.


If this has just started then it may be caused by upgrading hardware 
or corrupt data. Try these things and see if they help.

1. Delete the bncache.dat file in the Diablo directory. Also delete 
the contents of your Windows/temp directory in case there is corrupt 
data there causing the problem.

2. Run a scandisk and defrag and also make sure you have at least 50 
megs of free hard drive space for virtual memory.

3.If you recently upgraded any hardware then perhaps you need the 
newest Version of DirectX installed. (DirectX5). Click on the FAQ at 
the top of this page to find links to it and any hardware drivers 
that you might need to update.

Also,before you play Diablo, Hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and shut down extra 
programs except systray, explorer, and point32 if you have it and set 
your desktop to 640X480, 256 colors beforehand as well.

Hopefully your character files arent corriupted..Can you log on to 
battlenet with your character or does it crash when you select 
multiplayer?  If you can log on to battlenet with your character then 
i think one of the above suggestions will help you.  Post back if 
your still having trouble.  Lonara</pre>
