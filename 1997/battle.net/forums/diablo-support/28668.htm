<pre>&#62; Pete,
&#62; 
&#62; The patches have made the game more demanding, and problems in RAM or 
&#62; devices may show themselves in the later versions of Diablo on some 
&#62; systems when they do not in the earlier versions.  
&#62; 
&#62; Can you repost here with your system specifications, a description of 
&#62; the crash you are getting (including when you receive it in the game, 
&#62; and a copy of the error message), and list what you have done to try 
&#62; to fix things?  We should be able to give you more detailed feedback 
&#62; when we have this information.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62; Pat N.
&#62; 

Pat,

Thanks for responding.  Here are the gory details:

1) System Configuration

Processor: AMD K6/200
Video: ATI 3D PRO TURBO PC2TV (Direct Draw driver v. 2.04)
Sound: AWE 64 Value (running latest drivers, can't remember version #)
CDROM: Creative Labs Infra 1800 (also running latest drivers)
HD: 4.3 GB Quantum Fireball (No SCSI controllers in this system)
OS: Windows 95, Service Release 2
Network Protocols: TCP/IP, IPX
Modem: USR Sportster 28.8
Internet:  I connect through a local ISP (not AOL)

2)Description of crashes:
After beginning a multiplayer game (either on battle.net or on my IPX 
network) my screen freezes (with no distortion of the display), and 
my keyboard and mouse stop responding.  Also the sound stops.  About 
75&#37; of the time, I have to power the machine off and back on.  In 
the other 25&#37; of the cases, Diablo dies &#34;gracefully&#34; and 
returns me to Windows with a page fault like this one:

DIABLO caused an invalid page fault in
       module DIABLO.EXE at 0217:00435ed7.
       Registers:
       EAX=00000000 CS=0217 EIP=00435ed7 EFLGS=00010206
       EBX=008dfe28 SS=021f ESP=007dffd4 EBP=007e04ac
       ECX=007e00e8 DS=021f ESI=00000001 FS=354f
       EDX=00000104 ES=021f EDI=00000000 GS=0000
       Bytes at CS:EIP:
       53 56 57 8b f1 76 15 bf 84 30 4a 00 68 04 01 00 
       Stack dump:

And, as I mentioned earlier, this problem never happens in single-
player mode, v1.04.  It also doesn't happen under ANY mode in version 
1.00.


3) Things I've tried:

a) I always run in 640x480x256 video.

b) I always use the task manager to kill all processes except Systray 
and Explorer.

c) I've delete bncache.dat and removed battle.net.  (I remove 
bncache.dat every time I crash at battle.net)

d) I've changed sound cards.  I was using the onboard Vibra 16 sound 
chip on my ASUS TX97-XE motherboard.  I disabled it, and went out and 
spent $100 on a new AWE 64 Value.

e) I made sure I had the very latest drivers for my sound card, video 
card, and CD-ROM drive.

f) I tried playing without music.  Definitely reduced the CD-ROM 
access, but the crashes still happen.

g) Made sure my SIMMS were matched, timing wise.  I removed my old 
SIMMS and installed 2 identical 16MB SIMMS, 60ns EDO.
    I made sure to set my BIOS for 60ns RAM when I did this.

h) I tried disabling my internal cache, per a suggestion from 
Blizzard tech support (I think it was you, Pat).  I did seem to play 
a bit longer in those cases (maybe 2-5 minutes).  Don't know if this 
was just an abberation, or a sign of something real.

i) I've tried playing without Music.

j) I tried ripping out IPX, and just playing via TCP/IP over 
battle.net

k) I tried ripping out TCP/IP and just playing via IPX over my local 
network.

l) I've uninstalled Diablo, and reinstalled several times.  Tried 
applying just the 1.03 patch, and playing on my local network.

m)  Tried disabling 3D hardware acceleration on my video card.

n) Tried removing all non-essential stuff from my autoexec.bat and 
config.sy

o) Set buffers=80 in config.sys

p) I tried setting my CD-ROM drive as the slave drive on my primary 
IDE controller, and also tried it as the master drive on my secondary 
IDE controller.

q) I tried a different Diablo CD.

r) I swapped network cards.


Every one of these ideas failed.  I've been working on this every 
night for a week and a half now.  I hope that this information will 
help you guys figure out a possible solution.

Thanks,
Pete</pre>
