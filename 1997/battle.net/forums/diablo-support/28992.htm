&#62; Hello Blizzard Support!
&#62; 
&#62; Does GODLY FULL PLATE OF THE WHALE exist in multiplayer games?
&#62; 
&#62; I am starting to doubt it does, but I would like someone who works 
&#62; for Blizzard to confirm or deny the fact.
&#62; 
&#62; Does GODLY FULL PLATE OF THE WHALE exist only in Single Player games?
&#62; 
&#62; Does GODLY/HOLY FULL PLATE OF ANYTHING exist in only Single Player 
&#62; games?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I always have thought that these items were in Multiplayer games.  I 
&#62; have read posts with rumors regarding the fact that these items are 
&#62; being transferred from single player games and do not exist in 
&#62; multiplayer games.
&#62; 
&#62; The best FULL Plate I have found is Awesome Full Plate +150&#37; to 
&#62; armor with a suffix(forgot).  Is that the best Full plate available 
&#62; in Multiplayer games?
&#62; 
&#62; I have bought or found godly/holy helms and shields of all shapes and 
&#62; sizes, but never FULL PLATE.
&#62; 
&#62; If it is possible to find, what are the ODDS?
&#62; 
&#62; I have been playing the game for roughly 6 1/2 months now... I have 4 
&#62; characters above level 36 and about a total 1500 hours in on the 
&#62; game.  I am getting tired of the same sickly items every hell/hell, I 
&#62; want to know if these items are possible to find.
&#62; 
&#62; Please advise Blizzard...
&#62; 
&#62; Row - Legitimacy think about it....

If you look in the Strategy guide released by Blizzard, You will 
notice a great deal of prefixes and suffixes, all these items exist 
though not very common, though they do exist, the odds of finding a 
Godly Plate of whatever is not very good, but as Han Solo said in 
Star Wars (Lucasarts) &#34;Never tell me the Odds&#34;

Good luck in your travels</pre>
