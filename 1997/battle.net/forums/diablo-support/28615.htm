<pre>Since I learned I can only post twice in a day I'll break this into 
three distinct questions: 1.) I followed the instuctions after my 
last freeze ups and all seemed well.  Until my son was playing for 
about 45 minutes and tried to join a new game.  He hit &#34;Join&#34; 
and the screen went black.  THe Music was still playing.  Through the 
dumb luck of tapping madly on the keyboard I found the &#34;Task 
List&#34; and was able to terminate the operation -- sort of.  First, 
even though the Tast List showed &#34;Diablo&#34; at the top of the 
list it said (in parentheses) something to the effect that it was 
&#34;no longer active&#34;.  I can't swear to you then what I 
terminated to wrestle control back of my computer; I just kept 
terminating till I got a screen back with an image on it. (This 
process w/ the Task List was done in a weird b&w negatige image.)  
When I did get a picture back it was &#34;posterized&#34; or 
solarized&#34; whatever you want to call it.  And after I got out of 
it (it was the pic of the hut at the begining of the game) my desktop 
was once again too big for my monitor and I had to reset my monitor 
control settings. (BTW, per your advice, I now have a special setting 
for &#34;Battle.net&#34; in my control panel [640x480 @ 256] and it 
was set to that when play was begun.)  What might have happened this 
time to cause this type of freeze?  I've told my son he can't sign on 
until we get an answer and a fix...  Question #2.)  Somehow by doing 
the deletes and new graphics settings you prescribed for the last 
fix, something has disappeared: when &#34;Diablo&#34; lists the 
&#34;multi-player options&#34; now the ONLY OPTION SHOWN NOW is 
&#34;B.net&#34;, all the others like &#34;Modem&#34; and IPX and such 
are no longer there! POOF! What happened?  {I'm most curious since I 
told my son until we iron out B.net he could at least play modem-to-
modem with a friend...}  And finally, #3.) Where are the 
&#34;B.net&#34; files located exactly on my computer?  Is it 
&#34;Battle.snp&#34; under the Diablo directory?  It was only 
suggested before that I delete B.net and since I could find no 
separate directory I did not delete it (though I did delete the 
bncache.dat and all the temp files and I emptied my trashbin too just 
to make sure.) I'm still at heart a DOS guy so I like to know where 
everything is and to do a direct delete.

THANKS IN ADVANCE, AGAIN, FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
