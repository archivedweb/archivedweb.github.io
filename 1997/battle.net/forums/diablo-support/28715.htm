chances to dfind it, I pointed on class of items &#62; impossible to 
find! Those which are sold by wirt. If we look at &#62; modern GPOW's 
and rest of godly plates, we can notice one STRANGE (much deleted)  I 
have to agree, there is some kind of seeding problem with Diablo.Not 
sure if it started with 1.03 or what, but ever since 1.04 I havefound 
a lot more junk, and a lot more crap at Wirt. I have NEVER founda 
godly anything (and I have 2 level 45+ characters). Have never 
seenmuch of what is supposed to be available. The most expensive 
thing Ihave seen at Wirt is some kind of godly leather of the Whale, 
forabout 136K (AC 11). Now there is just NO WAY that he is going to 
sellGPO of anything better than about AC 13 - there is no way to 
carryenough money.  Before I got on Bnet and played only ver 1.0 in 
solo (using direct cable),I found rings and amulets with my level 35 
guy than I now find withANY of my characters. I am still using an 
original Jade of Zod that Ifound over 4 months ago - in thousands of 
hours, have never found anythingas good, and have never seen anyone 
else find anything as good.  I have never seen some of prefixes and 
suffixes that Blizzard saysexist - and even some of what should not 
be that great very seldomshow up. In version 1.0 I once had Wirt 
offer me a shield of blocking; nowblocking should not be all that 
rare, but most people don't even believethat I have seen one, or that 
it is legit.  Never seen any Kings, Knights,or Lords bow - have seen 
one Warriors bow in 1.03.  I have no idea how much (if any) of this 
is related to the version upgrades,but I do know that there are some 
items that NEVER show up, and othersthat could not be purchased if 
the DID show up.  There is definately a problem here, I am just not 
sure what it is...</pre>
