&#62; I posted a question couple of posts below concerning GPOW and I got 
&#62; the &#34;USUAL&#34; answer i.e. keep looking, however, I didn't ask 
&#62; what are my chances to dfind it, I pointed on class of items 
&#62; impossible to find! Those which are sold by wirt. If we look at 
&#62; modern GPOW's and rest of godly plates, we can notice one STRANGE 
&#62; detail, it has ONLY plus to HP or Osmosis or Ages suffixes. Those are 
&#62; ONLY ones which are supported by Wirt for armors, I saw about 6 
&#62; different kinds of Godly plate of the whales, and I never heard of 
&#62; Godly plate of Gigants or Sorcery or Anything else for that matter! 
&#62; Let me assure you that I found MUCH more items with suffix &#34;of 
&#62; sorcery&#34; then anything of the whales! That can let us track items 
&#62; right back to Wirt. About cost of GPOW, It's 240,000 gold pieces. At 
&#62; least Griswold when offers a 1/4 of price offers over 60,000 for it. 
&#62; I know it's possible to buy Godly plate of the whales in form of 
&#62; breast plate, however It's absolutely impossible to buy anything 
&#62; godly with ac over 50! Holy plate with ac 43 cost 133000! Once again, 
&#62; we are talking NOT about single Godly plate, but about absence of a 
&#62; CLASS of suffixes/prefixes in dungeon. For example &#34;Wierd&#34; 
&#62; this prefix is fairly weak, it has same to hit with &#34;King's&#34; 
&#62; but lack damage, why is it SO rare? In fact it's same rare with GPOW 
&#62; to find! Or Ruthless,..... if number of Savage bows/number of Massive 
&#62; bows = number of Ruthless bows/number of Savage bows found in Dungeon 
&#62; I should at least found 15 of them with EACH character! I found like 
&#62; 100 Awesome armors ranging from rags to full plates, YET I never 
&#62; found ANY SINGLE piece of HOLY armor! Leave alone Godly. Are you 
&#62; saying that Godly plates can be only found along with suffix of 
&#62; Whales? I would ask you please check it with creators of the game. I 
&#62; know it may sound non important to you, but once again, it's a great 
&#62; deal of Importance to us gamers!


I can absolutely second this. It seems that TechSupport is a little 
misinformed here, because as far as I know, NO one has EVER found a 
Holy item in multiplayer, and I severey doubt anyone has found 
anything godly.

Another point here is the infamous &#34;King's bow of Haste&#34;, 
which, as TechSupport claims, exists in multiplayer.
Actually, NO one has EVER seen an King's Bow of even the worst class 
(i.e. Short Bow or Hunter's Bow). Not just this, no one has even ever 
found a single Lord's bow or Knight's bow. To find these should be 
much easier than finding a King's bow, but there are NONE, not legit 
ones nor duped or hacked ones in multiplayer!

Could it be that TechSupport has it's knowledge from older versions 
of Diablo, in which it actually was possible to have such items in 
multiplayer?
