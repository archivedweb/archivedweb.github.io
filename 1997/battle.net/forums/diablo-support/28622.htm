&#62; &#62; Jeff,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Who are you talking to?  I hope its not me.  I tried to help you as 
&#62; &#62; best I could.  I think you are reading something into something that 
&#62; &#62; is not there.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; 
&#62; Helper,
&#62; No, the person that posted this about being the Help-a-holic was not 
&#62; me, and to me it seemed extremely sarcastic.  I was just a little 
&#62; angry that someone made fun of me because I asked for some help over 
&#62; something I had no idea about.  Sorry if you thought I was talking to 
&#62; you.  
&#62; 
&#62; Jeff


Jeff (from mindspring),

It sounds like there are two Jeff's posting on this forum, each with 
a different problem.  I don't think the Jeff that started this 
message thread was making fun of you -- I think they were making fun 
of themselves, but happened to have the same name as you :)

Jeff (from AOL),

The Helper has given you good advice.  If you are still having 
problems after freeing up space on your hard drive that has win95 
installed, can you repost here or send email to support@blizzard.com. 
 Give us your system specifications, describe the problem one more 
time (and include the error messages you receive), and tell us what 
you have done to try to fix things.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
