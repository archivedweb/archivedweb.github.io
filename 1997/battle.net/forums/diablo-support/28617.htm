&#62; I have been playing quite alot, so have been my friends, most of us 
&#62; have several level 40+ characters and we noticed one very interesting 
&#62; thing:
&#62;  You can find items with ONLY suffixes and prefixes which handled by 
&#62; either Grizwold or Adria. There are several suffixes and prefixes 
&#62; which are just impossible to find and only way to obtain them is to 
&#62; buy them from Wirt. Since Grizwold does not sell Emerald items, it 
&#62; seemed at first that this may be wrong, but Adria does sell emerald 
&#62; staffs!So there are list of suffixes and prefixes which are not sold 
&#62; by neither Adria nor Grizwold and which cannot be found in Labirinth:
&#62; Strange
&#62; Wierd
&#62; Ruthless
&#62; Mersiless
&#62; Mammoth
&#62; Whales
&#62; Holy
&#62; Godly
&#62; Thunder
&#62; Burning
&#62; Slaughter
&#62; 
&#62; there may be several more I don't remeber. However, I noticed that 
&#62; NONE of above prefixes were NEVER found by me nor by my friends in 
&#62; Labirinth. Now, it may be not important to you, but to folks who 
&#62; still play Diablo and consider themselves Legit players it is 
&#62; important!
&#62; We noticed that Wirt keep his prices in 140,000 range, i.e he never 
&#62; sells anything for over 140,000 gold! Nor does Grizwold. So since 
&#62; Wirt never sells anything CHEAPER then Grizwold, it is impossible to 
&#62; obtain things such as Godly Plate of the whales legit way, no matter 
&#62; how many times you lurk into &#34;Deeper levels of dungeon&#34;, 
&#62; because those items just cannot be found! Where is GPOW's coming 
&#62; from? Well I asked folks who played Single player game and they told 
&#62; me that pricing policy in Single player mode is DIFFERENT, in fact 
&#62; EVERYTHING is about 25&#37; of what it usually cost in 
&#62; multyplayer!Now if you hack your SINGLE player character to level for 
&#62; example 99 and then add unlimited gold hack you will only have to buy 
&#62; item each time you visit wirt! Eventually you will be able to BUY 
&#62; GPOW from him! I was assured that there are cheat programs which 
&#62; allow you to transfer items from single player to multy player. Well 
&#62; I already knew that! Since there is SO many items which can be found 
&#62; only in multyplayer.. anyway
&#62; QUESTION IS:
&#62; Am I right and GPOW was hacked from single player mode?
&#62; P.S. I would also love to know if there is Veil of Steel in 
&#62; multiplayer game, I never found it , but some folks I asked said THEY 
&#62; did!

Eugene,

You're brought up some compelling arguments, though I'll try to 
answer this one as best I can:

-It is true that there is a price maximum on the items you can 
purchase in town (this keeps one from not being able to carry enough 
gold to actually purchase an item offered), and I honestly don't know 
the price of the Godly Plate of the whale (though this would differ 
depending on the type of plate).

-Although you and your friends have never found items containing a 
group of suffixes or prefixes, this does not mean that they are not 
obtainable in the dungeon -- it merely means that they are VERY rare. 
 Hypothically, if the chance of a given creature dropping a Godly 
item in levels 13-16 of the dungeon in a multiplayer game of Diablo 
is 1 in 20,000(please allow me this bit of hand-waving for the sake 
of argument), then it would be understandable that such an item has 
not been found by you or your friends.

So, to answer your question, Godly plate of the whales is attainable 
in the multiplayer game of Diablo, though the rarity of such an item, 
and the fact that such armor has been heavily duped, would cause its 
possession by a player to be suspect.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
