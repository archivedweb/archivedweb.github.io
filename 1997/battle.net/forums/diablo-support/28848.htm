&#62; &#62; It's like you run a hex-editor while running diablo(even hexing 
&#62; &#62; something other than diablo) and diablo crashes. You'd think they 
&#62; &#62; could just say something &#34;We caught you cheating.&#34; and stop 
&#62; &#62; what you were trying to do. but no, it's &#34;We caught you cheating, 
&#62; &#62; now we're gonna crash your computer. HAHAHAHAHA.&#34; i mean they 
&#62; &#62; spend thousands of hours trying to figure out why YOUR COMPUTER needs 
&#62; &#62; to be fuked up. there worse than then little adolestent hackers bent 
&#62; &#62; on destroying all computers. one time my brother and i had four 
&#62; &#62; inventories FULL of LEGIT items we FOUND and my brother didn't want 
&#62; &#62; to get rid of his items(he ran out of room) so he used a hack so the 
&#62; &#62; items only took one space in the inventory. Well blizzard decided 
&#62; &#62; that we didn't need all those items we spent months collecting, and 
&#62; &#62; that we didn't have to know where the problem file was! blizzard wont 
&#62; &#62; disclose where it saves charector files on YOUR computer. they're 
&#62; &#62; response to any problems is &#34;uninstall and reinstall. the 
&#62; &#62; charectors lost is YOUR fault.&#34; well i hope some blizzard lackee 
&#62; &#62; reads this because im pissed. well i found the save files and im not 
&#62; &#62; holding back. the single player save files are saved in the diablo 
&#62; &#62; directory and there really not hard to find &#34;save_0.sv&#34; i 
&#62; &#62; think, but i haven't played single player for a while. the 
&#62; &#62; multiplayer files are little bit more complicated, and are kept in 
&#62; &#62; the windows directory with the names &#34;dlinfo_0.drv&#34;-
&#62; &#62; &#34;dlinfo_10.drv&#34; depending on how many multiplayer chars you 
&#62; &#62; have. if you have the problem where everytime you click on 
&#62; &#62; multiplayer on the main menu, diablo crashes, it's probably one of 
&#62; &#62; your chars(incorrect placement, altered attributes etc.) so, you 
&#62; &#62; figured out what's wrong, now what do you do?
&#62; &#62; well first and formost, DO NOT goto blizzard or ask ANY blizzard 
&#62; &#62; employee. they hate cheats and think that you should pay by 
&#62; &#62; uninstalling your diablo chars. they get ALOT of fun messing with 
&#62; &#62; cheaters(personal experiance[telling them that it laughable to cheat, 
&#62; &#62; making fun of them, banning them, and basically not caring at all, 
&#62; &#62; even though half of all questions are cheat-related{the rest are from 
&#62; &#62; newbies that don't know how to press F1}]) and should NOT be trusted. 
&#62; &#62; i have been told MANY times to re-install diablo by ignorant blizzard 
&#62; &#62; techs. the main fact is, blizzard knows less about how the hackers 
&#62; &#62; cheat than the hackers know about diablo. if they left diablo up to 
&#62; &#62; the (RESPONSIBLE)hackers (see raymond's diablo page) almost every 
&#62; &#62; single problem would be solved within days. but no, we cant let the 
&#62; &#62; people with REAL intelligence take care of things because they might 
&#62; &#62; make our little baby easier for newbies!
&#62; 
&#62; I'm with The Helper on this one...expect nothing from anyone here.
&#62; 
&#62; I think you need a few lessons in programming.  Think about it.  
&#62; Diablo was designed the way the programmers felt.  In this code, they 
&#62; didn't do any checking for weird things like one item per spot, or 
&#62; levels greater than the highest level (50) or spells that were 
&#62; unusually high, or stats that were unusually high, or items that 
&#62; don't even exist on the CD.  Now when the cheat programs force Diablo 
&#62; to use these settings, Diablo doesn't have any idea how to handle 
&#62; them causing a crash.  Don't blame Blizzard for 3rd party programs 
&#62; forcing Diablo to set invalid parameters within the game.  
&#62; 
&#62; Blizzard didn't put checks into the game to see if you were cheating, 
&#62; the game just doesn't understand the new parameters it is now forced 
&#62; to use which causes the crash.  The only patches Blizzard has put 
&#62; into Diablo is to stop people from hurting other players.  Although I 
&#62; think they could (and should) have gone further with it, at least 
&#62; cheaters like yourself can't come in and townkill or autokill people 
&#62; anymore.  Blizzard has already stated it will not try to get rid of 
&#62; max stats, spells, inventory items, etc.  If you want to cheat, fine, 
&#62; go right ahead.  But don't start running your mouth off at Blizzard 
&#62; for something that is NOT supported by Blizzard.  Cheats not only 
&#62; ruin the fun of the game, but also cause all kinds of problems.  USE 
&#62; THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Enough said!


Okay enough said ...who want's to waste time on a cranky 12 year old 
kid.. who lost a few items.....:)
Have a nice treasure hunting day
