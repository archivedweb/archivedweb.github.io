&#62; Blizzard,

&#62; I am one of the many people that feel something weird has happened to 
&#62; item generation. The dungeons just don't generate anything as good as 
&#62; they used to generate when I was 15-20 levels lower fighting wimps.  
&#62; I never have seen certain items I saw in the early days. In fact, the 
&#62; best items that I have are from Diablo 1.00 and 1.01 that my 25th (at 
&#62; that time) level rogue found ... she started finding tons of +30&#37; 
&#62; resist all and +30 to magic, and awesome plate of sorcery, and 
&#62; similar stuff. Then a number of days after I hit a level where I was 
&#62; regularly turning up quality stuff, some patch (1.02? 1.03?) changed 
&#62; that. NOW, my level 42 mage and my level 33 rogue and my level 31 
&#62; fighter are still having to depend on the 3-4 rings and armors I 
&#62; found way back then, since the generator hasn't turned out anything 
&#62; better. I have played them all  in normal/hell, nightmare/hell or 
&#62; hell/hell for 42 levels of sorcerer, 8 MORE rogue levels and 31 
&#62; fighter levels. Has something happened to the item generation? Did 
&#62; something get broken or were the odds tweaked? Some item types don't 
&#62; appear at all.
&#62; 
&#62; I am going to try an Experiment, and I hope some of you will too. I 
&#62; happen to have access to a 2nd computer that DOES NOT yet have Diablo 
&#62; on it, and it isn't on the internet. I'm gonna install Diablo 1.0 and 
&#62; play a mage to level 40, and see what items I can find. If I 
&#62; regularly get rockin' treasure, then we will know something has 
&#62; changed. If I don't, well, I'll have a level 40 mage on another 
&#62; machine I can play with. :) And, I'll have fun. :) BUT, if I get 
&#62; great items regularly, we will know something IS currently broken.
&#62; 
&#62; If anyone does the same experiment, report your findings here, since, 
&#62; in my opinion, this is a technical problem or error in the game 
&#62; (until and unless I conclude I'm just imagining things). IF Blizzard 
&#62; HAS tweaked the odds for any reason, I wish they would just say so; 
&#62; it would be OK. If they haven't, I hope this idea will show that 
&#62; either there IS a technical problem or that I AM imagining things. :)

Lewis,

None of the Diablo patches make changes to the item generation 
schemes.  If you find this not to be the case, repost here or send 
email to support@blizzard.com.

As St. Michael mentioned (and it appears that you agree), the quality 
of the item you find in the dungeon is dependent on the level of the 
dungeon you are exploring, while the quality of the items you can 
purchase in town is dependent on the level of your character.

Regards,
Pat N.</pre>
