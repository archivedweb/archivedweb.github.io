<pre>On Thu Jul 17 16:58, Thank You for answering  wrote:
&#62; I posted these questions earlier and you were very kind in your
&#62; response, but now I will dscribe the circumstances a little better.
&#62; 
&#62; 1. &#60;MULTIPLAYER GAME / SOLO, IPX &#62;
&#62;    My problem was, that more than once, as I was fighting Laz et.al.
&#62; I was hit by a fireball (with full health and full Mana shield), which
&#62; killed me in one shot (not a small feat). When I restarted in town, 
&#62; I was still wearing all of my equipment! strange, yes?
&#62; 
&#62;    This might be related- again, more than once, as I killed everyone
&#62; but Laz, I enter his room and he doesn't react! He just stands there,
&#62; following me with his head, but not reacting. If I shoot arrows, they 
&#62; pass right through him! only when I touch him by walking right up to 
&#62; his face does he wake up. What I have done, on occasion, is Stone 
&#62; curse him, but like I said my arrows miss, until I stand toe-to-toe,
&#62; when he shakes off the curse immediately and lays into me.
&#62;    Now, I thought you might be sceptical, so I grabbed a screen shot 
&#62; of me, standing near enough to see the color of Laz's eyes, and my 
&#62; golem is walking away from him (apparently my golem's can't hurt him 
&#62; in this state either).
&#62; 
&#62;         Lastly, this has only happened once, : I dropped a port in an 
&#62; Empty room, (empty!).  I returned to town, then back thru the portal,
&#62; BUT, I was in a room FULL of knights and drakes and soul burners. 
&#62; (who very quickly finished me off as I had no time to even through up 
&#62; Mana shield.
&#62; 
&#62;         Ok, this is really &#34;lastly&#34; :  It is also true that 
&#62; on another occasion, as I emerged onto the dungeon through my portal, 
&#62; I right clicked to teleport, but I ended up not 40 feet away, but 
&#62; 400. (the other side of the level)  Now, as I was walking INTO the 
&#62; port, I moved  the cursor (that cute little hand) into the top right 
&#62; corner of the screen (because that is where I had just died so my 
&#62; stuff was waiting for me), and the moment I saw the dungeoin appear 
&#62; on my screen, I clicked.
&#62; 
&#62;        So, I hope these questions are better now that they are more 
&#62; descriptive.
&#62; 
&#62; Thank you.
