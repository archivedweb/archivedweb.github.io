&#62; Hail to thee
&#62; 
&#62; I got a Hercules Stingray 3D with 6Mb RAM and a big problem with it.
&#62; It has a Voodoo-Rush chipset and wenn i play in WIN95, lets say Jedi-
&#62; Knights or Xwing vs Tiefighter it runs absolutly smooth. But now 
&#62; comes the bad part: All 5 or 6 minutes it stocks for about 1 second, 
&#62; and that always 4 times. After that it runs smooth again, but after 5 
&#62; mins it start again. Try to catch a Tie-advanced with something like 
&#62; that. It only happens in Windows and since i bought that card. The 
&#62; service man from the store i bought it from said thats normal with 3D-
&#62; cards. Yeah, sure! I know lots of people with 3D-cards and they dont 
&#62; have that problems. He told me that Windows might load in the 
&#62; background but i dont see the busy-light on my PC lighting up when 
&#62; that happens. Then he said i should defrag my harddisks and i did, 
&#62; but it didnt get better. 
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to know if it is my 3D-card before i buy another card. 
&#62; Or maybe the card doesnt do so well with my AMD-K6 200 PC. Curse me i 
&#62; didnt buy a real Pentium 200 MMX. Does anyone else have probs with 
&#62; that card? And can anybody tell me a really good 3D-card with a 
&#62; Voodoo-chipset or something as good as that? A Monster-3D with a 2D-
&#62; card would be great combination i heard. Is that true?
&#62; 
&#62; Please post the answer here or mail me.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanx in advance

Hello Andy,

indeed everything with a voodoo (not 'rush') chipset is better in 3d 
than the stingray. The 'Rush' chipset should have
been the '2nd generation' voodoo but it wasn't. Actually it does not 
have the performance of the normal voodoo.
At this time, i personally prefer a combination of a good 2d card 
(Everything with a TSENG ET 6000 like the Hercules
Dynamite 128 or a Matrox Millenium) and a voodoo add-on card (like 
the monster 3d).

Another good alternative is a card with the relatively new 'riva 128' 
chipset from nvidia (Elsa Victory Eraser, Diamond
Viper 330). It's combined 2d/3d card with outstanding performance 
both in 2d and 3d. The only problem is , that there 
are not many games that support it , besides games that support 
direct 3d (so no glquake, pod, ea sports titles at the 
moment).

If this wasn't enough, just take a look at the 'voodooextreme.com'. 
Their hardware-section should provide you with
all the information you need about 3d-cards!!!

Oh, and when you want to keep your stingray, try to install the 
latest drivers from the hercules website. I never heard
of your problem before, but probably it helps.

Good luck...
