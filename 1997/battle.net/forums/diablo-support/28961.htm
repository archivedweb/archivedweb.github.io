&#62; The last person I was speaking to was Pat N. Im kind of getting 
&#62; answers from both of you. Anyway....Mr. Pat suggested that I switch 
&#62; off a button in the connection section of the INTERNET icon located 
&#62; in the control panel. It was the &#34;Connect to internet as 
&#62; Needed&#34; button. I have switched that off as directed and I am 
&#62; still getting the not configured for dial-up networking message. Im 
&#62; not sure how much info you have gotten on my problems. (if Pat N. got 
&#62; it instead of you). I am using netscape navigator 3.0, I am using 
&#62; Sympatico as my ISP and Ihave not gotten the 1.04 upgrade for Diablo. 
&#62; If you need any more info on my system or problem(s) that you might 
&#62; not have got E-MAIL me or just ask in the next message and i can fill 
&#62; you in on any details. Like I said in my last message, SYMPATICO IS 
&#62; NO HELP!!!! You are the only guys who can assist me. 

Captain,

Trust me, if you posted your questions here I have read them. :)  The 
only problem was that if the question was a couple of days ago and I 
did not hear any response I automatically assume problem fixed, not 
good assumption apparently.

OK, your problem is not normal, let me explain a little first what 
that error message is....

Your system is not configured for dial up networking, ....  you have 
to make connection manually.  When you start Diablo and try to log 
onto Battle.net, Diablo automatically searches for your internet 
connection, if it does not find an internet connection, it attempts 
to connect to the internet using your Internet Dialer, that is 
configured in Dial up Networking.  That message comes up when it 
detects no connection to the internet and cannot bring up the dialer. 
 Normally this message only appears when you are using AOL 3.0 for 
windows (16 bit application) or when you are using a 16 bit winsock.  
Since you say you are using Netscape 3.0 for your software, when you 
installed it, it should have configured you for dial up networking 
and used that 32 bit winsock that navigator comes with.

Now, I was not expecting the answers you gave me.  I was actually 
expecting you to tell me that your were using some Sympatico software 
to connect to the internet.  I think I know what your problem is but 
I am not expert enough at setting up internet connections to walk you 
thru this, Blizzard won't have the time to do this either because it 
is not Diablo related.  You are in luck however, you are using 
Netscape Navigator 3.0, smart move, they have excellent tech support. 
You need to call, not e-mail, Netscape Tech Support, you need to tell 
them that you either bought, if you did, or that you are trying there 
product and you are having big problems, describe your problem, be by 
your computer, and be ready for some answers.  You can probably find 
there tech support number on there site

Captain, I have taken an interest in your problem, so, if you still 
are not fixed after Netscape helps you, and if you do whatever 
Blizzard tells you to do next, and it does not work, I will let you e-
mail me and we will take this to e-mail.  So, good luck.
