&#62; I have already posted this but your solution didn't work, you said to 
&#62; re-install, run scandisk, delete win-temp, try with all programs 
&#62; closed. STILL SAME PROBLEM. Here is my post from last week which 
&#62; explains the situation-
&#62; 
&#62; I need help!! Urgently!!!
&#62; I have had Diablo for more 2 months now and are constantly playing 
&#62; battle.net. Today I was in the middle of a game on battle.net and the 
&#62; game crashed back into Windows 95. Since then I have not been able to 
&#62; go into the multiplayer menu, it CRASHES AS SOON AS I CLICK ON THE 
&#62; MULTIPLAYER OPTION. Windows brings up the following:
&#62; This program has caused an illegal operation and should be shutdown.
&#62; If problem persists contact program vendor
&#62; The details show:
&#62; DIABLO caused invalid page fault 
&#62; in module Diablo.exe at 014f:0046d5gb
&#62; Registers:
&#62; etc etc (I could give you the actual numbers and stack dumps if you 
&#62; need)
&#62; 
&#62; I have re-installed Diablo and patch v1.04 (without deleting saved 
&#62; games). I have un-installed battle.net and deleted the file 
&#62; BNCACHE.DAT and deleted the contents of win-temp folder. I have tried 
&#62; different resolutions, turned of all programs not needed and have 
&#62; plenty of free disk space ( Also done what you said should fix it). I 
&#62; also know that its not my drivers or directx drivers conflicting or 
&#62; being out of date, it should be working fine. It has been working for 
&#62; months and I have been playing battle.net every night, why now?????
&#62; There is also some file called DIABLO.ERR, and there are only 4 saved 
&#62; game files which includes my single player characters. Where is my 
&#62; battle.net warrior???
&#62; 
&#62; Here are my computer details:
&#62; Compaq- Presario 8770
&#62; Pentium 200mmx
&#62; 16mb sync dram (ram)
&#62; 33.6 modem
&#62; 16 speed CD-ROM
&#62; S3 Virge 3D chip
&#62; ESS ES1888 Plug and Play Audio Drive (soundblaster pro compatible)
&#62; 
&#62; This computer has been working like a dream until now and don't know 
&#62; what to do. I think it may work if I totally delete Diablo including 
&#62; the saved games and re-install. But I can't do that, its taken me 2 
&#62; months, around 2 or more hours each night on battle.net to get my 
&#62; warrior where he is, without cheating. That is ALOT of money on 
&#62; Internet bills and I do not want to throw that away with some stupid 
&#62; crashing problem, if I do ill give up and probably never play 
&#62; battle.net and Diablo again. It would be a waste of time and money to 
&#62; start from scratch again. I am really stressing out now!
&#62; I need help, I love Diablo and need to play battle.net (its an 
&#62; addiction) with my built up warrior. 

Aceman,

I just sent you email regarding this.
