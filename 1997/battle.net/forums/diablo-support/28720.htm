&#62; &#62; I have read all of your postings on the subject. I am useing aol 3.0 
&#62; &#62; for win 95. Yes it is 32 bit. I open aol and go to the web. I 
&#62; &#62; minumize, then start Diablo. I get the bad red screen. You know, the 
&#62; &#62; one that says connect manually.
&#62; &#62; What's up? I have a 166 pentium, 32 meg of ram, 28.8 modem. As far as 
&#62; &#62; I can tell, the modem is set up right. flow is on, and I am using 
&#62; &#62; hardware vs. software. Help... Also, I tried modem to modem. It 
&#62; &#62; connects to the other modem, but say's 
&#62; &#62; that the other computer dosn't have Diablo. The other person has the 
&#62; &#62; same problem when he tries to call me. Yes he is already in the game..
&#62; &#62; Thanks for the help...
&#62; 
&#62; Jason,
&#62; 
&#62; Lazerjedi's probably nailed your modem-to-modem problem.  If you are 
&#62; not using the same version of Diablo, then you will not be able to 
&#62; see your friend's game.  If your friend has connected to battle.net 
&#62; recently, then they are using v1.04 of Diablo.  Because you are still 
&#62; having trouble connecting, you probably are using version 1.0.  The 
&#62; v1.04 patch is available on our web site here:
&#62; <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/library/patches.htm">http://www.blizzard.com/library/patches.htm</a>
&#62; 
&#62; You should download this patch into your Diablo folder, and run it.  
&#62; This will update your version to v1.04.  If your friend is not using 
&#62; this version, then he should download the patch as well.  Note: the 
&#62; version of Diablo you are currently using is shown in the bottom 
&#62; corner of your main Diablo menu screen.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, to your battle.net connection problem.  I know it is 
&#62; frustrating, but, even though you may have the win95 version of AOL 
&#62; installed on your system, you may be using an older version of AOL 
&#62; when you connect (this can be the case if you've recently installed 
&#62; the win95 version).
&#62; 
&#62; If you've recently downloaded and run setup95.exe from AOL, then you 
&#62; will still have the older version on your computer, and you may be 
&#62; running the old version still (especially if you are using a win95 
&#62; shortcut to connect to AOL).  To make sure you are running the win95 
&#62; version of AOL when you connect, click on Start--Programs--America 
&#62; Online--then &#34;America Online for Windows 95&#34;.  Also make sure 
&#62; that you've clicked the &#34;connect now&#34; button (you must 
&#62; actually connect to AOL before you run Diablo).
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62; Pat N.




Hey guy's, thanks for the help. Just one thing. It didn't work. I 
already have V 1.04. I also tried to connect the way you said. 
Actually I did that before I asked for help. I go to programs, aol, 
aol for win 95. I don't know about the M to M problem yet. I am off 
today, but my counterpart has to work...Sucks for him...lol. Any more 
ideas? I would love to try and play on line.. Thanks again..</pre>
