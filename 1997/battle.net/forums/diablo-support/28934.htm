&#62; &#62; I cannot believe the audacity of you to come into the tech support 
&#62; &#62; forum and complain to Blizzard about losing your inventory because 
&#62; &#62; you cheated.  Why in the world do you think Blizzard would spend one 
&#62; &#62; iota of time helping someone with some program that they did not 
&#62; &#62; develop.  If you use a cheat program, you are using a cheat program 
&#62; &#62; at your own risk.  If you wanted to know what the save game files 
&#62; &#62; were for the purposes of backing up, then you could of e-mailed 
&#62; &#62; blizzard and they would have told you.  I don't feel sorry for you 
&#62; &#62; for one second because you lost your inventory.  You should have 
&#62; &#62; known the risks before you went and cheated.  One more thing, if you 
&#62; &#62; for one second think a Blizzard employee made fun of a cheater, you 
&#62; &#62; have got a another thing coming.  It is clear in Blizzard policy that 
&#62; &#62; they do not care about any cheats except those that effect other 
&#62; &#62; players.  If you want to hack your character up to level 99, give 
&#62; &#62; yourself all the spells, hacked items, be able to carry a whole 
&#62; &#62; inventory in one spot, that just ruins the game for yourself.  It 
&#62; &#62; does make the game unstable and causes all kinds of problems, but 
&#62; &#62; they have no obligation to support that.  You better do a reality 
&#62; &#62; check before you come into this forum spouting that kind of stuff.
