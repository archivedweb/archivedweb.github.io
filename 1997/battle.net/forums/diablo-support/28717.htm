<pre>&#62; Hello, 
&#62; 
&#62; The Helper here,  you need to contact your cable modem service and
&#62; verify that they are not restricting TCP packets on ports 116 and 118,
&#62; those ports have to be open for in/out TCP packets.  Port 6112 has to 
&#62; be open for in/out UDP packets.  Ask them if those ports are open, if 
&#62; they are not, try and convince them to do it so you can play Diablo.  
&#62; The TCP packets look like they are not making it in your case, if it 
&#62; was just the UDP packets, you would be able to get on Battle.net, but 
&#62; you would only be able to chat.
&#62; 
&#62; If they are not restricting those ports,  you need to answer this
&#62; question, what you will do next will depend on the answer.  Have you
&#62; ever been able to play Diablo with that setup before?
&#62; 
&#62; If the answer is yes, 
&#62; 
&#62; Uninstall Battle.net, not Diablo from My Computer - Control Panel - 
&#62; Add/Remove Programs - Battle.net and remove.
&#62; 
&#62; Then go to your Diablo folder and verify that the file BNCACHE.DAT is
&#62; gone, if it is not, delete it.
&#62; 
&#62; Delete the contents of your Windows Temp Folder
&#62; 
&#62; Try Diablo again.  If it still does not work follow the advice below.
&#62; 
&#62; If you have never been able to play Diablo before, you might want to
&#62; find out how to manually ping the battle.net server.  A ping is a 
&#62; signal sent by your computer to a server, one you specify.  The 
&#62; server will answer the ping and you can tell if you have a connection 
&#62; to that
&#62; server.  If you find out that your connection is blocked some way, 
&#62; tell your ISP that your not able to ping the server and see what the 
&#62; deal is.  I am sorry I cannot tell you any more about the ping 
&#62; utility, I have never used it but I know the concept.  You will 
&#62; probably have to get the server address from Blizzard.  I suggest you 
&#62; E-Mail Blizzard Tech Support for this information
&#62; 
&#62; support@blizzard.com
&#62; 
&#62; Hope this helps,
&#62; 
&#62; The Helper
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  The program that sends the ping is called ping.exe, it usually 
&#62; is located in your windows folder.  I am sorry but I don't know how 
&#62; to work it.

Hello Helper or Tech Support.
  I have been having the same problems as he is and I have done all 
the suggestions that have been givin.. I have spoke to RoadRunner 
Support and they insure that the ports are open.. they claim that we 
need to go through a firewall as does AOL but the AOL solutions do 
not work either.. THe Support group at RoadRunner has said that if 
one of your Tech people would like to call them and try to work this 
solution out they would be happy to help as they know they and you 
both have clients that are trying to access this game and want the 
problems solved.. their toll free number is.. 1-800-573-7675   all 
your person needs to do is explain who you are and need to speak to 
Tech Level 2 and maybe this problem can be solved.. I enjoy this game 
very much and do not wish to have to pay another service provided to 
be able to play it.. Thank you for your time..

Sincerely
Jeff Calhoun</pre>
