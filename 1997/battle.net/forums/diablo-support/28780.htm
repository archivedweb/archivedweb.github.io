&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THAT ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM?
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I TRIED IT WITHOUT UPGRADING THE DIABLO GAME WITH NO SUCCESS.  I 
&#62; &#62; &#62; TRIED IT AFTER UPGRADING TO VERSION 1.04 WITH STILL NO SUCCESS.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I KEEP GETTING THE MESSAGE &#34;COULDN'T DETECT A MULTIPLAYER 
&#62; &#62; &#62; GAME&#34;.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I'M ATTEMPTING TO CONNECT COM 2 TO COM 2.  THE PORTS ARE WORKING.  I 
&#62; &#62; &#62; CAN DIRECT CONNECT WITH WINDOWS 95 AS HOST AND GUEST.  I CAN GET ON 
&#62; &#62; &#62; THE INTERNET WITH BOTH COMPUTERS AFTER RECONNECTING THE MODEMS.  I 
&#62; &#62; &#62; CAN CONNECT BETWEEN BOTH SYSTEMS VIA WINDOWS HYPER TERMINAL.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; ANY SUGGESTIONS?
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I'VE BEEN TRYING THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; I DESPERATELY NEED A SOLUTION.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; THANKS, HEXDRIVE
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Both computers have to have the same version of Diablo, if one is 
&#62; &#62; upgraded, the other has to be also.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You must be using a null modem cable.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You must not be connecting the computers via any other program, 
&#62; &#62; Diablo should detect the connection on its own.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You gotta make sure that in the device manager of both computers, the 
&#62; &#62; com ports you are using do not have any conflicts.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There is a text file located in your Diablo folder called serial.doc. 
&#62; &#62;  That file has a lot of direct connect troubleshooting information.  
&#62; &#62; If, after checking the text file and the stuff I discussed, you still 
&#62; &#62; have problems, post back and we will help you further.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Hope this helps,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Helper
&#62; 
&#62; THANKS FOR REPLYING.  HOWEVER I DID OR CHECKED EVERYTHING YOU 
&#62; MENTIONED BEFORE POSTING MY ORIGINAL MESSAGE.
&#62; 
&#62; IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO OR CHECK?
&#62; 
&#62; HEXDRIVE

HEXDRIVE,

I don't have anything else to add, I am sorry, you should repost your 
message tomorrow morning, a message this far back in the forum can be 
overlooked.  Blizzard Support will address your problem them.  You 
can also e-mail them at

support@blizzard.com

It would be helpful if you tell them exactly what you have already 
done, and what I told you to do, so they don't just tell you the same 
thing again.  You might also want to double check that none of your 
devices are trying to use Com 4, that might conflict with Com 2.

Sorry I could not help,

The Helper

P.S.  If you want your message answered by Blizzard support, it is 
important to post your message Mon-Fri in the morning, after that or 
on weekends, your chances of a prompt answer go way down.</pre>
