<pre>Hi alls,

Here Ive tried to do a report on alls suggestions written on this 
forum since september 97.
I hope you'll like it. And Blizzard, answers us on this report.
For the fans, comments please, or add suggestion.. Thanks.

     1)The ability to customize a new character class with an 
included editor. 
     2)More interaction between characters, such as in Ultima Online. 
     3)Different character animations for each type of armor and not 
just the class.
     4)Many more unique types of weapons instead of the same graphic 
for several. 
     5)Shops and other buildings should be increased to have multiple 
blacksmiths, magic shops, etc. 
     6) To completely stop cheating on Battle.net and turn it into 
something like Ultima Online with a
     &#34;world.&#34; 
     7)There should be many more multi player quests that really need 
people to work together as a
     team. 
    8) There should be other races besides humans to play with, such 
as elfes and dwarves. 
    9) Blacksmiths should be able to have customized weapons put in 
an order. For example, you
     determine the strengths, and magic, in fonction your gold and 
notoriety
   10) incorpore a notoriety system. If the players is a pk, he lost 
a part of notoriety. If he complete a quest, or help another player, 
he      obtain a bonus notoriety 
     11) incorporate a thief
    12) More weapons such as throwing daggers, pikes/spears, poisons, 
hell a rock too!  
    13) More creative traps such as pitfalls and other Indiana Jones' 
spoofs. 
    14) Multiple ways to get killed, including decapitations, etc. 
Everyone wants gore! :) 
     15)An online bounty hunter building where it is possible to post 
bounties and where to claim them
     as well. 
     16) give us the possibilty to build our own house, dungeon, a 
labyrinth editor.
    17) An online bank so we wouldn't have to have tons of gold in 
our inventory all the time. 
     18)To be able to hunt down demons or monsters and embed their 
soul's energy into a rune
     weapon 
     19) to be able to turn our character into a evil character. I 
like this idea.
     20)To be able to have two weapon configurations stored so you 
could press a button to alter your
     attack. 
    21) Some natural enemies like lions, snake, etc. AND have human 
enemies such as vagabonds or
     wild warriors. 
    22) To have dungeons which actually go UP. For example a tall 
temple to conquer. 
     23)Be able to purchase horses to travel between towns faster ( 
sounds like UO ). But not down into the dungeon whit the horse
     24)There should be &#34;counter&#34; spells such as ice or snow 
to counter spells such as firewall. 
    25) There needs to be an option to have two one handed weapons at 
once like in some other RPG
     series. 
    26) Weapons upgrades would be a nice addition. The items could be 
embued with magic or
     something similar. 
     27)Different hotkeys for spells such as F1 through F8 to help 
out those sorcerors with many spells
     in combat. 
      28)If you pk someone and take their ear, it should include 
their character info like their IP number
     or whatever to give a definite description. 
    29) Everyone wants to create their own quests somehow, so why not 
include a built in quest
     editor?! 
    30) When making a character it should be possible to change them 
physically like their hair color,
     etc. 
     31)You should be able to have up to 8 people in multiplayer and 
have built-in AI players to assist
     you. 
     32)Each weapon should have different attack modes such as two or 
one handed each being a
     different attack power. 
     33)The mages should be able to morph into various creatures 
instead of simply making one in a
     spell. 
     34)Day and night need to be introduced; shops could close and 
monsters could be different. 
     35) For PKers, instead of having a huge inventory full of ears, 
you could have an &#34;ear necklace.&#34;
     Pretty sick :) 
    36) Weather for surface battles, similar to night and day, could 
affect things such as attacks and
     monsters. 
     37)Those high level warriors with crazy 1000 point fireballs 
need to be stopped to make things
     more proportional. 
    38) A new type of quest, a rescue quest, would be good since a 
person would have to escort the
     POWs out of the dungeon - a challenge! 


Well, i guess it s all... Thanks for to read this.
Ans a special thanks at Warnet.com, and diablo2citadel, and alls fans 
on diablo forum.

Pat, or Blizzard could you do the point on this suggestion? And give 
us news please...The waiting for
D2 is too longggggggggg.....
