&#62; &#62; If a sequel to Diablo is going to be made I have a few suggestions:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1)Enable a primary/secondary weapon hotkey. I think a hotkey that 
&#62; &#62; allows you to quickly switch between two weapons would be extremely 
&#62; &#62; useful. For instance, if you're using a sword as your primary weapon 
&#62; &#62; and you suddenly run into a group of the undead, you could hit the 
&#62; &#62; switch hotkey and switch from your sword to your mace, the secondary 
&#62; &#62; weapon. This would also be great when killing Blood Knights with your 
&#62; &#62; sword, then quickly switching to a bow to finish off the Advocates.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2)I think everyone would love an invisibility spell. There are so 
&#62; &#62; many possibilities to work with there. You could limit it however you 
&#62; &#62; want: have it use two points of mana for every second you're 
&#62; &#62; invisible, or you could have unlimited invisiblility, but become 
&#62; &#62; visible whenever you attack or cast a spell. Any way that you decide 
&#62; &#62; to make it, I'm sure players will find it useful.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3)I'd like to see a version of teleport that brings up the automap 
&#62; &#62; and allows you to click on a part of the map, and that is where you 
&#62; &#62; are teleported.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 4)The messages in multiplayer are great, but how is it that a player 
&#62; &#62; in town can talk to players in the dungeon? I think the message 
&#62; &#62; function should only be available when you can see another player, or 
&#62; &#62; at least are within earshot. Maybe, shouting at another player might 
&#62; &#62; alert monsters nearby. I just don't think players could communicate 
&#62; &#62; with other players on different levels. Unless, they had a Telepathy 
&#62; &#62; spell.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 5)I understand that Diablo wasn't created to focus on Quests, but I 
&#62; &#62; think it has extraordinary potential for some great ones. In the 
&#62; &#62; Magic Rock quest, all you had to do was find the rock on level 5. In 
&#62; &#62; Gharbad the Weak, all you did was go see him four different 
&#62; &#62; times(which was a pain). More complicated NPCs would be a start to 
&#62; &#62; more involved quests.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 6)As far as NPCs go, the ones in town are great, but I'd like to see 
&#62; &#62; some in the dungeon. I'd especially like to see some NPCs that would 
&#62; &#62; join you. If you create a golem to follow you around and attack 
&#62; &#62; monsters, why not ask a monster that Diablo doesn't pay well enough. 
&#62; &#62; I think some summoning and binding spells are definitely in order.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks for considering
&#62; 
&#62;     They are very good ideas. I dont like one thing though you cant 
&#62; commnicate unless u are very close. Nice idea but it would make 
&#62; Diablos way 2 hard.
&#62; I have a suggestion also. On single player games some of the 
&#62; characters in the town should come down and help you everyonce  in a 
&#62; while. Example the blacksmith could fight very good. Suggestion 
&#62; number 6 is ok but a monster would not help a human. Remember the sin 
&#62; wars in Diablo all monsters in Diablos wont to destroy humans. The 
&#62; only monsters in Diablo thats may help you would be the Steels 
&#62; Kinghts or Doom Guards.  



Well, I have to agree that most of these ideas are pretty good. With 
some exceptions:
An invisibility spell would make the game too easy for the pk's. Just 
imagine them sneaking up on you without you even noticing it. It's 
bad enough with the ghosts but if the pk's can sneek up to you 
without cheating......well, maybe if the spell didn't last very long 
and only existed on staffs and scrolls

I also agree that only be able to send messages to the guys you can 
see would make the game too hard.

If this is a sequel as in Diablo 2 we're talking about I think that 
more changes would be needed. Like:

1. New and cool monsters, weapons, spells and characters
2. A new town. I meen that the forces of darkness have fucked enough 
with Tristram.
3. A totally new story. Diablo can't rise again that would be like in 
some lousy B-movie (Jason's back again, and again, and 
again....)Maybe one of the other Prime-Evils could start to mess with 
the world.
4. Blizzard have to make it harder to cheat.
5. Make the game bigger, with a big fast access map that can take you 
outside the town, like to the forest or something. I, for one, think 
it's kind of silly that everything is in the little village of 
Tristram.



Well I guess that's it
