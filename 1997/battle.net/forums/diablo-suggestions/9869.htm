<pre>   First I would like to thank Blizzard for this wonderful game.  I 
have been playing since the day Diablo first hit the shelves and I 
still enjoy the game.   Even though cheating is rampant of B-net, I 
have learned who generally to trust and still enjoy playing on B-net. 
 Although I feel that Blizzards postition on cheats is a little lax, 
I understand that it is hard for them to cover everything and I hope 
that they will learn some lessons with this game as they make others.
   Now some questions.  I am curious on how weapon and armor 
generation is done.  For example,  I am now playing with a warrior 
that only uses axes and just recently started using magic (at level 
28).  With this character, I have found much better armor (awesome 
plate) in normal hell when he was at lev 27 as opposed to my level 33 
characters in any level.  Also Griswald seems to offer him much 
better equipment than to my other characters.  Is there any reason 
for this?
  Secondly, I generally have noticed that unique characters tend to 
drop better equipment.  But often in the lower levels they often drop 
books, and really bad books at that (inferno or firebolt usually).  
Is this just my bad luck?
  I do read this page atleast once a day and I would apreciate any 
comments on this.  As for anyone on B-net that is looking for a good 
fun game look for my characters-Mazzule(lev34 mage), Riviennia(lev35 
rogue) and Sebaxtycle (lev 30 warrior).

                                                    Bob</pre>
