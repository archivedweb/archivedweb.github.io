<pre>game design / gameplay suggestions

1) The rectangular screen sometimes makes it difficult when you are 
moving up. You can barely see what you are walking into sometimes. 
Perhaps a round playing area might work better. The controls and 
buttons would be to the sides since most monitors are rectangular and 
the circular playing area would take up the whole height of the 
screen and an equal distance in the middle length of the screen. At 
any rate, there should be a little more distance between the 
character and the top edge.

2) Probably, already heard it, but the town must go. Or at least get 
much more compact. Or become a bigger part of playing the game. 
Personally, I prefer the first of the 3 options. This leads me to an 
idea for battlenet. When you log on the first screen you see is an 
overhead view of a large town or city. As you move your mouse over 
the city it highlights the roofs of various buildings and tells you 
what they are (no need to have a character moving around in the city 
though.) There would be a lot of pubs (representing the public chat 
channels), private clubs for the private chats (the city might have a 
section outside its walls which could accomadate a changing number of 
buildings), several shops - a weaponsmith, bowyer, armorer, and 
apothecary that sell the basic potions and all the normal, nonmagical 
weapons and armor (but no magical items), and of couse a public 
trading square (which perhaps would allow for a fair exchange of gold 
and items.) I think this would give the game a much better atmosphere 
than the sci-fi like screens bnet presently has and it would take 
care of some of the basic non-adventure functions without devoting a 
lot of space or time to it. The city would also have to appear when 
people start non-bnet games, but the pubs or trading post just 
wouldn't highlighted. (btw I'm not wild about banks in crpgs and if 
you don't go with a server based game again it won't matter anyways, 
but a jewelry shop that sold very expensive gems, rings, or amulets 
might be another way to allow players to work at amassing and 
carrying a little more wealth.)

3) The four hotkeys worked well for Diablo, but a sequel will 
probably add more spells (and hopefully skills) and would require 
more. However, its already kind of akward going from the hotkeys to 
the belt keys - anything more than 4 keys right next to each other I 
find aggravating. As an alternative to making 8 or more spell/skill 
hotkeys how about keys to scroll through your options. Both mouse 
buttons would have a little window like there is now for the spell to 
be cast when you right click. The basic move/hack function would be 
the default on the left button, but since you have to stop to do 
anything anyways you could still get to some spells/skills from this 
one as well. This should make a lot of options available quickly 
without having to fumble around the keyboard (yes, I never got past 
the training exercise in X- Wing.) Another key could bring up two 
versions of your spells and skills in two wheels that represent what 
order they rotate in for each mouse button. You could click and drag 
them around to your own specifications. Probably, an overcomplicated 
explanation, but I think this would be much simplier to play than 
having to use more than 4 keys all around the keyboard (even potions 
and scrolls could be used this way.)
