<pre>When I envision a good player on player battle, I see people who want 
to fight.  No it doesn't take skill to ambush people while they kill 
monsters, but it doesn't always mean you will lose.  I was a 38th 
level fighter and I got ambushed by a 30th level mage and a 33 level 
fighter who were my &#34;teamates&#34;.  I killed one of the two 
before the fireballs cought up to me.  I was close to winning that 
fight where I was WAY out numbered (level wise).  So, there IS in 
fact skill in player fighting.  I have killed a couple players in my 
games, but it was all in good fun (once was to show off what a maxed 
out strength could do.  I was 38th level, and I killed a 17th level 
fighter with one hit.....bare handed.  It was great).  Another time 
there was a jerk who stole some items from a friend of mine.  I knew 
he had them, but he continually refused.  So...I cast a ring of 
firewalls around him and watched him squirm a bit.  He still wouldn't 
admit it so I ran through my own fire and killed him with my sword.  
It was great fun. (plus I got paid for doing it).  He finally 
admitted he had them and returned them.

My point is, player killing can be fun.  Player slaughter via 
cheating or taking on weaklings is pathetic and an insult to 
yourself.  Just because some people don't know how to handle this 
ability doesn't mean it's a bad thing alltogether.
