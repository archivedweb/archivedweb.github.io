&#62; &#62; way to insure that you cannot be pk'd...If there is not then there 
&#62; &#62; went the 40 bucks I WAS going to spend........I cannot see how Bliz 
&#62; &#62; can justify not having a forum for legits only....at least no 
&#62; &#62; pk's...Too bad, I really thought i would enjoy the game, but i refuse 
&#62; &#62; to build a cheat duping killer just so I can survive the pk's....so 
&#62; &#62; unless I see diffrent in the future....I will never purchase a 
&#62; &#62; Blizzard game.
&#62; If there was no pk the multiplayer game would be no challenge. Just 
&#62; think about it. If no one could kill another player then you could 
&#62; not hurt them (if you could hurt them down to 1 hp then moster kill 
&#62; would run rampent) and so your shots, spells, slashes, etc would not 
&#62; hurt other players so you could go down into a dungeon and just hack 
&#62; away and not worry about hitting other players thus removing a large 
&#62; amount of challenge.

  I think you all have good points, however I beleive that Pkilling 
should be allowed. The problem arises when you get killed by a 
cheating Pkiller. I will never cheat in Diablo(even if I ever play 
again). I will not be turned to the dark side of the Force. If 
cheating were eliminated, the game would be fun again, however there 
is no point to play online anymore. The single player game is good, 
but it really doesn't take very long to win. I can start a rogue and 
finish the game with her in about a day. Eliminate the hackabilty. 
Update the game, so that everyone has to make new characters for B-
net(ie the old ones wont work anymore). Then keep everyones 
characters saved on B-net. I liked Diablo, but I feel like Blizzard 
owes me half my money back! Multi player play is ruined! I wish I had 
never bought the game. Evertime I see the box I think of what else I 
could have gotten. I'm sorry but hackers have turned this game into a 
joke!</pre>
