<pre>Hi everybody,

first off, let me tell you this: I have only read a few of the 
various suggestions on this page, so hats off to Blizzard if they are 
indeed readinga all these many messages and take the essence out of 
each one. 

Unfortunately that is the reason why I don't know whether this was 
suggested before (it probably was, as there were a lot of ideas I 
have had as well on that page), but I am going to present it anyway. 
Whoever reads this, I hope it will make Diablo 2 a better game:

1. Two handed items like an axe or a staff should be better in 
contrast to the one handed items. In Diablo every item had a maximum 
of adding 30 points to a certain attribute, so a sword of wizardry 
could add 30 magic and a shield of wizardry could add another 30 in 
the best possible case. However a staff of wizardry has got a maximum 
of 30 as well, giving it a considerable disadvantage regarding sword 
and shield. I think those two handed weapons should be supported, 
because it would add more flavor to the game. It is cheesie to see 
every mage running around with a sword and a shield. So maybe a class 
bonus would do the trick as well. You know a mage could get more out 
of a staff than a warrior for instance...

2. Magic: The magic system of Diablo was very good the way it was, 
because it was like the rest of the game simple to use. However I 
feel that the &#34;two way&#34; spells like heal other where you need 
to click right and then left on the designated target, are breaking 
the Diablo rule of easy use. Maybe you should consider to have them 
heal the character standing next to you, so only one mouseclick would 
be required.
Another point is that magic is too powerful. Maybe this could be 
solved with items containing spellike abilities. I know you tried 
this with apocalypse and nova, but I think there should be more like 
that. Real powerful big bang effects and summon spells (like the 
golem), but only in item form. Something like alladin's lamp to 
summon a Djinni. And that lamp couldn't be recharged. Five uses and 
it would be burned out trash... Consider this, I think very powerful 
spells should only exist in that burn out form...

3. Scrolls. If you stick to the scrolls, you should consider giving 
them out in packs. I mean if one scroll uses up one whole space of 
inventory noone is going to use them (except for ressurrect and 
identify), because a mana potion gives you the same effect, only more 
often. If you were able to pack, say ten scrolls of townportal, into 
one space, it would be a whole different story. Anyway I feel you 
need to either get rid of the scrolls or improve them.

4. Big Monsters. There should be more monster like the Butcher or 
King Leoric in the game. However they shouldn't appear in every game. 
With Diablo there were a few surprises when you played it the second 
time. A few monsters you haven't seen on first playing it, but that 
was about it. I think Diablo2 should come up with a few more 
surprises. A neat way to prevent people from playing Diablo a few 
times in a row and having seen everything then is to make those 
monsters available step by step. Like the constant updates on the 
version (1.04 this far) you should introduce a few more monsters and 
possible even items and quests as time passes by. If you made like 10 
big monsters and added 5 in the game and made the remaining 5 
available in steps of 2 month I think this would add a lot to the fun 
of the game.

Well, that's about it for now. Thanks for listening and I'd really 
like to see those things on Diablo2. :)

With regards,
Kai</pre>
