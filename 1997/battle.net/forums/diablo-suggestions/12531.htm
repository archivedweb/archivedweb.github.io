&#62; Today's suggestion is simple: provide a battle arena in one of the 
&#62; towns in D2 where special combats take place.  This will allow 
&#62; characters to challenge each other and to conduct battles without 
&#62; penalties, as I will explain momentarily.
&#62; 
&#62; If a special battle area (perhaps a certain building allows entry to 
&#62; the arena - or even several DIFFERENT arenas?  Hey, sometimes I even 
&#62; impress myself!) can be set aside from the rest of the game, several 
&#62; changes to the standard combat sequence could be worked in to 
&#62; maintain the status quo:
&#62;    1.   No experience is gained at the conclusion of the battle
&#62;    2.   No items are generated or won at the conclusion of the battle
&#62;    3.   When a character is killed, the &#34;scatter items&#34; 
&#62; command is skipped - their stuff doesn't fly off of their corpse when 
&#62; they die in the arena.
&#62;    4.   When the battle is over and all participants on one side are 
&#62; dead or incapacitated, the &#34;deceased&#34; can be automatically 
&#62; &#34;resurrected&#34; by the Arena staff.  The staff could also sweep 
&#62; away debris and scatter fresh sawdust.
&#62; 
&#62; As I see it, the Arena could be entered by several different 
&#62; characters at a time who could then slug out their differences in the 
&#62; time-honored tradition of combat to the &#34;death.&#34;  With the 
&#62; addition of a Ranking board and a Challenge board for BattleNet, I 
&#62; think the arena would be an outstanding addition.  Even in the single-
&#62; player version, NPCs in the town may challenge the characters to test 
&#62; their readiness or, in very special circumstances, the NPC might even 
&#62; give the characters a special reward if the character can beat them 
&#62; (or a designated champion) in the arena.
&#62; 
&#62; For very special events, maybe a mass-combat of a dozen or more 
&#62; adversaries could square off... although that's probably too much to 
&#62; ask.

KIA,

This suggestion has been mentioned in the past (and it does sound 
pretty cool :).  I have forwarded it to the development team.
