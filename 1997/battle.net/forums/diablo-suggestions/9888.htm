&#62; I have gone and looked at the stuff for Ultima 2. Yea, it deffinetly 
&#62; has some great things, for a MUDD. That's all it is. Don't compare it 
&#62; to Diablo. Diablo is a game. Ultima Online is a MUDD. And that's that.
&#62; Oh, one other thing. The requirements for Ultima Online are unreal. I 
&#62; have a Pent. 120. I have on complaints about it. But, you need AT 
&#62; LEASt a pentium 133. Hell, what are you going to need that much for. 
&#62; I just think that the requirements are a bit much for Ultima Online.
&#62;   Now, as for a few things that I would like to see in Diablo 2. I 
&#62; have read other people's suggestions about Diablo 2. I find a lot of 
&#62; them interesting. I say without a doubt though, Diablo 2 needs to 
&#62; focus a lot on the multi player aspect. Don't try for the bells and 
&#62; whistles on single player. No one plays it. 
&#62;   I like the idea of the horses. I would personally like more story 
&#62; line, more scenery, and more characters. Those are my big ones. That 
&#62; and a lot of people will want to transfer their char from Diablo 1 to 
&#62; 2. Make sure that they can do that.

I cannot agree with you about UO! How can you possibly say that uo is 
not a game! D and UO are both games. Diablo is anextremely
linear game. Sure the dungeon looks different everytime, but its 
still the same storyline. Diablo has great graphics, wonderful audio
and spells that look awsome, however I find it hard to even call it a 
true rpg. The only interaction between players is helping to kill 
or tryingto not get killed. How you act and what you do has almost no 
bearing on your character. Your actions have little or no 
consequences. UO will have a storyline, however from day1 of its 
release players will begin shaping the world(and I do mean shaping). 
You can design and build your own house! The world is HUGE. 750 gigs 
of space is used just to store the contents
of the world map. thousands of players will be interacting in the 
same game!(thats a little better than 4). UO is a game on a grand 
scale, where as Diablo is just a really nice game, but with some 
extremely serious flaws! Woe be to the people who did the in house 
beta testing of diablo. Obviously none of them tried to hack it! 
Diablo was a great game, but its days are wayning. It is no fun to 
always be on the lookout for cheaters everywhere you go. I don't mind 
if someone outright turns and murders my character, as long as they 
didn't cheat to do it. You will find that UO will be a far greater 
game in many ways then Diablo ever was. The only people who will stay 
on Diablo(if they have a choice) will be the folks who can't do 
anything right without cheating. I prefer a challenge, rather than a 
cheat.</pre>
