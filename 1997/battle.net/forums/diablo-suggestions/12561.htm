<pre>This idea may have already been posted, but here goes anyways. It 
involves your on-screen character being more reflective of the gear 
they are carrying. For example, if you don't have a helm, you 
shouldn't be wearing one on-screen. And while Diablo does have 3 
separate armor graphics, perhaps having different graphics showing 
rags, coats, robes, the &#34;samurai&#34; mail, would be much better. 
Amulets can also be represented by being drawn over the character's 
armor. Also, why not make unique items really unique, by having 
different graphics for when the player has them equipped. For 
example, the Butcher's Cleaver would actually be a cleaver, the 
Dreamflange could have a mystic aura surrounding it; the Royal 
Circlet would be a jewel studded crown; StormShield would be 
bigger/have a different picture on the shield front; and the list 
goes on and on. It would be especially great for multiplayer, nothing 
like showing off that Royal Circlet to your fellow players! While 
this is all purely cosmetic, and may take up many resources because 
of all the combinations resulting from it, I still believe it would 
add greatly to the enjoyment of the game (who knows, maybe people 
will pass on GPOW because Arkaine's Valor looks better... well, maybe 
not...)</pre>
