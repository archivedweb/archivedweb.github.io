<pre>It's ridiculous to say that player fighting is bad because you lose. 
People play sports even though there is always a losing team...  
Having to watch your back puts an element in the game that adds 
excitement.  Running about invincible killing people is childish and 
makes for poor gameplay, but playing in a group where a single guy 
may want to take on the others in the party when he becomes overcome 
with greed for his share of gold (or whatever) is interesting.  It 
places a stake on your time investment.  It makes you ask yourself: 
&#34;Do I think the character I have invested all this time and 
effort into can cut it against his character?&#34;  

Frankly, I am disappointed player fighting has had such a poor 
turnout.  When I first read about the game and the possibility of 
characters battling it out, I got excited with images of teamwork to 
defeat another set characters.  But instead, I come here and read 
posts from whiney kids who are afraid to drop their gold.  I think 
you should drop everything (gold and items) when you are killed by 
another player.  If you are getting attacked by an invincible 
cheater, then quit the game before he kills you.  Think about your 
character, make him the best you can, and pit your character against 
another.  It's fun, and it's challenging.  You'll find most other 
players are far more difficult than Diablo ever will be.
