&#62;    Ok this has nothing to do with sex and porno and stuff I just 
&#62; wanted to make you people read this. Regarding talking inside the 
&#62; game it really doesn't sound realistic that players can speak with 
&#62; each other from different levels as if they had TELEPATHY. Now that's 
&#62; an Idea for the next RPG you people are going to make.

All I have to say is that talking inisde the game is nessary for 
diablo beaues you can only play upto 4 players, and you need all the 
communication possible.  It would be silly If I had to cast a spell 
to talk to anthor player on a different level!

This would only work on a game like ultima online (which will pee all 
over diablo when relased) to talk to people in differn't towns or to 
find were people were last seen
 
&#62;    Talents. Talents are missing from the game only a single talent 
&#62; AKA skill are present per character class. The ability to gain talent 
&#62; would be nice.  talents should be learned from NPC's (non player 
&#62; characters) or from other players who already know talents but they 
&#62; should meet the requirements for a particular talent.

Yeah, that sounds cool, but I think youi should be able to have a 
talent in a certen spell after you have used it so much and have it 
in a certian level.  This would be something only the highest players 
go for!

&#62;    Character Classes, Abilities, and Attributes. The Attributes: 
&#62; Strength, Magic, Agility, and Endurance are very limited and has a 
&#62; broad scope. It would be nice if you could add some more character 
&#62; attributes so this would have a better feel and realism. Addictive as 
&#62; Diablo is, it is still lacking in the RPG area.

I don't think this need to be changed realy in diablo!
