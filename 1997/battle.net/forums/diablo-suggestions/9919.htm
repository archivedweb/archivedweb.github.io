<pre>&#62; Finally, an idea I had long ago that I posted: generic magic system. 
&#62; Let there be spells that can consist of combinations of any of the 
&#62; following: a) area, appearance, sound, result. Therefore you could 
&#62; have &#34;chain healing&#34; that sounded like fire and looked like 
&#62; green clouds. Or you could have &#34;phasing guardian&#34; which 
&#62; floats in one spot lookig like an immobile charged bolt, but it 
&#62; shoots what appears to be firebolts at targets. When they hit, the 
&#62; target is phased. OR perhaps &#34;wall of stone curse&#34; ... should 
&#62; be self-explanatory. HOWEVER, the weird combos would be generated in 
&#62; the form of unique books  ... not every player would have every weird 
&#62; combo he wanted ... the standard spells would remain the same. A 
&#62; player could have up to 5 unique spells at any one time, and perhaps 
&#62; some new elixir or tablet would let him up the spell levels. 
&#62; Whatever. Anyway, if the graphics/sound/internal engine could handle 
&#62; the various appearances and sounds and effects generically, then no 
&#62; special code for each spell. Just appearance, area, sound, and 
&#62; results.

i think ur magic system should be considred...it's a bit 
original..and doesn't sound all that bad...as for myelf i would like 
to see a magic system where the wizard have to choose a certain kind 
of area that he's better in...such as fire maybe....see my thuinking 
pattern ??...cuz as it is now the best character is the mage...cuz 
his spells are too powerful..of course he is weak at first...but as 
soon as he can manage on his own heäs just too good...he don't need 
to be good at close combat...cuz noone's ever gonna get in range to 
to whack him with a sword...so...i think theyu should implement a 
choice..where he selects a certain area in which heäs better than 
other spells.:)..an example of this...say u choose the healing 
area...and through that he could have spell level 15 in all healing 
spells..and maybe spell lvl 10 in the others..and maybe in the 
opposite spellarea (like maybe combat spells) only spell lvl 5 or 8 
maybe...

this is in no way a suggestion i have considered for a long time...so 
it's not very developed..but i think most of u see in what way i 
think....and do feel free to carry this thought further.:):)
