&#62; 
&#62; but I was impressed enough by your product to want to add my $0.02:
&#62; 
&#62; MORE CHARACTER FREEDOM:  Characters should be allowed to do whatever 
&#62; they want.   i.e.  If you want to kill Peppin, go ahead...  Sure, 
&#62; you'll get a couple of potions, but then you'll be without an 
&#62; important source of healing.  And maybe the other town members will 
&#62; shun you from then on...  The addition of choices and consequences 
&#62; would add depth to the game.  In a similar vein, it should be 
&#62; possible to fail quests.  For example, if you want to drink the 
&#62; golden elixir rather than giving it to Lachdanan, that should be your 
&#62; choice, as should killing the friendly NPC's.  However, you may miss 
&#62; out on some choice items;  maybe you'll choose differently the next 
&#62; time you play...

Very original idea, this should make players coming back for more.
 
&#62; 
&#62; CHEATING:  Unless you can ensure that no one will be able to cheat (a 
&#62; difficult task indeed!), you should take the wind out of their sails 
&#62; and build it into the game.  LET them cheat if they want to...  
&#62; However, Battle.Net should recognize the cheaters and sequester them 
&#62; from legitimate characters.  Besides isolating those characters for 
&#62; which the provided cheat menu has been used, a criteria of 
&#62; inappropriate statistics or improbable combinations of magic items 
&#62; could be used to judge someone a cheater.  A history for each 
&#62; character could also be kept rather easily:  every moster they killed 
&#62; etc...  Encrypted, such a history might be difficult to forge and 
&#62; from it one could easily verify if this character has the appropriate 
&#62; amount of experience, etc...

Another original idead, Blizzard should take notice of this.

&#62; 
&#62; LESS LINEAR:  I would like to see larger levels.  Ideally they would 
&#62; be large enough that players would not feel compelled to explore the 
&#62; whole level.  I wouldn't have a problem with it if the game had to 
&#62; stop and load more of a level after you passed through a certain 
&#62; door, etc... If the levels weren't all square-shaped, that would be a 
&#62; bonus.   There should be multiple stairs down, some leading to dead-
&#62; end levels, others providing multiple paths to the same objective.
&#62; 
&#62; BETTER GRAPHICS:  The graphics are good.  However, by the time Diablo 
&#62; II comes out, I imagine there'll be a swarm of imitators...  Adopt 
&#62; The Motion Factory's graphics engine (at www.motion-factory.com).  It 
&#62; may be $25,000, but it's worth it...

 If the loading time thru every door is neglectible, then this is one 
hell of idea.

&#62; 
&#62; MORE COMPLEX QUESTS:  Quests are a good idea, but they should be more 
&#62; than &#34;kill these monsters and bring this item to whomever...&#34; 
&#62;  Particularly interesting might be timed quests...  i.e. if you don't 
&#62; clear out a pocket of evil near the town quickly enough, the monsters 
&#62; invade the town and start to kill the inhabitants...  If you don't 
&#62; clear the water supply, inhabitants start leaving...

What do u do when the inhabitants leave?? U can't get ur weapons 
repaired, no potions to buy etc.

&#62; 
&#62; MORE INTERACTIVITY:  An excellent way to extend the character 
&#62; interface would be:  Whatever you're holding, if you can use it 
&#62; on/with what it is touching on the screen, that object lights up.  
&#62; i.e.  hmmm, maybe that old coin you found a couple of levels ago 
&#62; would do something in this fountain.  You pull it out of your 
&#62; inventory, move it over the fountain, and voila!  the fountain lights 
&#62; up...

And Auzurewrath comes out of the water!!

&#62; 
&#62; MORE D&D:  Although I'm sure your lawyers would vehemently deny it, 
&#62; you've borrowed a lot from D&D (and other RPG's)  Borrow more:  How 
&#62; about rooms where the doors close and they start to fill with water?  
&#62;  Hmmm, I can swim across this river if I leave all my stuff 
&#62; behind...;    Ahh, Adria warned me not to touch any of the treasure 
&#62; in this room....

More dialogues by the characters will be nice

&#62; 
&#62; HAVE MONSTERS DISPERSE FROM THE VICINITY OF STAIRS:  Dying before you 
&#62; can even cast one spell is annoying...

I thought they already are?

&#62; 
&#62; MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GO TO TOWN:  Maybe if you cast a town-
&#62; portal, the nearest one appears.  However, it may be on a level above 
&#62; or below you....  It would be fun if characters had to work and 
&#62; extend themselves to get back to town sometimes rather than 
&#62; recharging on a whim.

No comments
  
&#62; 
&#62; WANDERING MONSTERS:  Some of the monsters should wander rather than 
&#62; wait for the characters.

Someone mentioned this before. This will be a nice touch to the 
gameplay.

&#62; 
&#62; ENCOURAGE ROLE-PLAYING:  When each new character is made, a one-page 
&#62; history of that character should be provided including 
&#62; characteristics such as honesty, greed, bravery, intelligence, etc... 
&#62;  There's no need to ENFORCE role-playing in the game; just supplying 
&#62; this little nudge/hint would probably encourage many players to add 
&#62; this dimension to their gaming experience.

Will be another nice touch.

&#62; 
&#62; finally,
&#62; MORE USEFUL NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS:  While it was amusing, the vast 
&#62; majority of what the characters in town had to say was useless.  They 
&#62; should offer more information.  Maybe you could come across a fellow 
&#62; adventurer who would drop a few hints for the right price...

Blizzard has announced that there will be more NPCs in D2.

&#62;

Top comments John, hope Blizzard will let this post go to waste.
