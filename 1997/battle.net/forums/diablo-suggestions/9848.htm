<pre>I think that Diablo 2 would be an even better game if it included a 
more RPG type theme.Say,like traveling to other towns.Someone else 
said that and i agree that would make the game alot better.I think 
that the game DaggerFall is a really great game because you can 
customize your character any way you want.If you were a PK people 
would know.I think you should be able to dress differently (say in 
towns)and be able to switch shirts and things like that.Also,one of 
the best features for DaggerFall was the way that everything you did 
affected how the game turned out.Like it said,&#34;watch out,that 
person you just robbed could be the emporer's nephew.The Main thing 
is the huge world that daggerfall had.So many places to go.You could 
buy your own house and invite your friends over or have a guild 
meeting.
Anyway,Blizzard has already started making Diablo 2 and i really 
wouldnt wanna wait unless it was really worth it.Maybe they should 
use these ideas on Diablo 3......</pre>
