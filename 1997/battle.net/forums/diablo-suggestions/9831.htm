<pre>I would just like to share some ideas i have on diablo 2.  First of 
all I think it would be great to have horses in the game!  I think 
there should be a ranch or something where you buy the horse and also 
you can equip it with armor (the horse should be able to die.)  Make 
the horse be able to carry things on it.
Second, I think a new level like a swamp where you go knee deep in 
nasty water killing enemies popping up left and right.  
Third, when you join a game i think instead of having a loading 
screen when you go down to the first lvl of hell or the cats etc. it 
should be more like a role playing game with fast loading but in 
order to do this i would make it to where it loads in the first of 
every lvl in the game.  
Fourth,  Bows and arrows should be like the mage's staff's, they 
should have to refill the arrows at some kind of elf or something and 
be able to upgrade weapons to a certain extent.  
Also i don't know how you could do this in multiplayer but it would 
be cool if for a quest you have to protect the town from monsters 
killing people off.
Fifth, deffinitely if possible expand the number of character's aloud 
in one game (I know the lag's bad already but it would be very cool 
to have about 6 in one game than 4.)
And last, you should be able to go into the tavern and get a drink, 
go inside griswold's place and actually watch him repair you sword or 
whatever it is.  Also the water around the town make that flowing 
(but i would put an option of some sort to let you disable the 
flowing water.  

Sincerely,

Scott Smith

Battle.net character's are:

Cloud (warrior lvl 36)
ZeroDivide (mage lvl 31) 
Link (warrior lvl 30 and current character right now)

P.S.  Please diablo fans and maker's of diablo don't get me wrong 
diablo is my favorite game of all time just i'd like people to 
consider these ideas of mine thanx :)</pre>
