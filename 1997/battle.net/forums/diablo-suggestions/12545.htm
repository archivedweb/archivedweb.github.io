&#62; Heres a suggestion pat!!!    if there is a theif in D2, then he 
&#62; should have -100&#37;light radius.  No one should be able to see him 
&#62; unless he is right next to them.  With this , without changing diablo 
&#62; one bit, we have created the element of surprise.  For each point of 
&#62; dexterity, his chance to hit should be increased by 3&#37;  4 is to 
&#62; much, 2 is to little

Hey! This Idea added to the ones placed in the thread started by
The_Retainer below would really make the thief a playable character
in Diablo 2!

That and if the thief could steal from players make it so that
if the Victims catch the thief and decide to take back their 
property that they could deathmatch with him to do so.  
After defeating the thief the player could look at  his 
inventory and take the item in question or any 1 or 2 
(or 3 what they hey the thief is lying on the floor...) items.

Hey isn't that something? I told it once and I'll tell it again...
Replying is fun! hehehe</pre>
