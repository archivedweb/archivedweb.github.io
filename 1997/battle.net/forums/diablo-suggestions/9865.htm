&#62; I agree with you but some people get a kick out of it.  I hate 
&#62; getting pked to it sux a big one.  But think about it.......it's 
&#62; actually a good  thing.  Say someone pisses you off takes something 
&#62; of your's (gold, weapon, armor etc.)  Then you can fight back and 
&#62; kill the person and take their stuff and your's back.  I like having 
&#62; the option to pk i don't pk personally i think it's mean too but a 
&#62; good way to fight back!

PK'ing is definatly something that should stay in the game..it's good 
feature...without pk there would be no bounty hunters and such...no 
real excitement when u have to cover ur own back...but when u say 
that peeps should get out of a game when an invincible cheater enters 
is to demand too much...cuz usually u don't know that he's a god mode 
person until u are dead already...after u have lost 400 hp in one 
whack..or after blasting him with 10 lvl17 f-balls without him taking 
damage...but as long as pk stays legit there is nothing wrong with 
it.:)
