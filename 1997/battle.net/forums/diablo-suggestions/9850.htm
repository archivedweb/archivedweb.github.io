<pre>Well....I have a couple thoughts to say.and I have no other good 
place to put them but here!! so here it goes.
1.I feel that DIABLO is the best game out right now...BLIZZARD just 
has to do a little work on it. Yea..there's pks, tks, dupers, 
hackers,      and cheaters. But Diablo I was like a trail or a 
begining to a never ending gaming experience. On Battle.net I listen 
and listen      and listen and all I hear is Blizzard should do this 
and Blizzard should fix or do that..well..I'm tired of it! Blizzard 
sees what that      did wrong in part 1 and when they make part 
2...there going to make it even better and harder for players to hack 
at it! So ust lay      off of them...there doing there job and making 
these games for us! what else could you ask for???
2.I just thought that sence I'm here I will say my thought about 
Diablo II.  I have read most of the suggestions on DIABLO II and I 
fell       that....
          1. There should be more out doors fighting..maybe even with 
the vilage and where there is a time in Battle.net that people        
          come out of the homes and talk to you and it even gets 
night time and the sun comes up accoreding to the time that           
       Battle.net has set.  
          2. maybe there could be a spirt every 4 levels or after you 
kill so many monsters that comes out and helps you by healing you     
             or giving you a special Item that only a certain number 
of players have and if you dupe it..it gets deleated!. 
          3.I feel that you should be able to use a portal or 
telaport and be able to join a different game from a game your 
allready in.                  and that if someone knows your name and 
is searching for you..they can talk to you in the game if they are in 
the chat                       and visversa.  If there was some way 
that you can make it so players can trade in the chat instead of 
going to a game to                    trade with players it would be 
really helpfull! and noone could run off with your stuff because you 
could set it up so that                  you have to place both items 
on a tray type of thing and you both get to look at the other persons 
item and agree or                  disagree or the trade!
           4.If there was someway to join a StarCraft game right from 
a DIABLO game...that would be cool!! And have some type of            
      ranking system for players!
           5.I really like DIABLO alot....but I HATE thoughs PKs, and 
TKs. Yea...the TKing isnt as bad now because of the patch..but the    
              PKs are terrable. You should be able to play a game and 
not worry about being killed by the other players! If you want to     
             PK, then fine..do it to other PKs and I feel that there 
should be a way to tell who is a PK by the color of there name or     
             something like that, I mean HELL...you can tell who is a 
warrior, a mage, and a rouge..why cant you tell who is a pk?? 
            6.everytime I get on Diablo..my name is confused with 
someone elses name! I think that there should be a way to determain   
               who is who by some sort or identifacation. Anythink at 
all..hair color, portait, picture, even an ID..almost like a credit 
card                  or something like that.
            7.I think that there should be some way to have more 
people in each game and the chat be more like the game.. wher you     
             have the charricters walking around and geting and doing 
stuff that they need to do but once they goto the door it is like     
             changing levels and it brings you to a corrador of 
games..all the games listed are rooms in this corrador..doors on both 
                 sides all he way down. It would make it more 
interesting! You could meet in the corrador and ask people to join 
you on                  the quest. and go from there!!
WELL..I must be going..my name on BATTLE.NET is PHOENIX (warrior)  
and PHOENIXSTAR (mage)
I'll be lookingat and reading these messages every day! so...please 
coment on these!!THANK YOU!!
