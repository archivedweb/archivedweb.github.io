&#62;         First i'd like to say that PK-ing is inportant in an RPG as 
&#62; much as monsters are. It improves gameplay by bringing in things like 
&#62; betryal and assasinations.
&#62;         Secondly....cheating has to go. But of course no metter how 
&#62; many times ppl say that there will be always some1 who will do it.
&#62;         Thirdly, mages are not weak. Actually they are the most 
&#62; powerfull characters once they reach the later levels. However it is 
&#62; true that they are hardest to start with
&#62; 
&#62; LASTLY here is a little suggestion for Diablo 2 and that 
&#62; is.....SECRET PASSGAGES...there isn't enough of them. I mean what's 
&#62; an rpg with out levers opening secret doors. Pressure pads activating 
&#62; traps. And how about a few NPCs in the dungeon...i mean the kind that 
&#62; is friendly...and even the one witch is willing to join you.
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.
&#62; Personally i am not a PK, and i hate PKs, i hate monsters too, but 
&#62; then again game would be boring withouth any of them


Your idea is totally correct. PK's should stay but cheaters should go.

I'm not a PK either but PK's are good for the game.
Imagine walking with a bunch of guys and knowing that they can't kill 
you........boring
I love to not know for certain if the ones I'm playing with are PK's 
or not. That makes me watch my back much better.


 And for all of you who keep whining &#34;The bastard Monster-killed 
me and stole all my good stuff&#34; I can only say that this has 
happened to me to, it sucks, but it's part of the game.

p.s Are any of you guys from Mississippi? I'm going there as a 
exchange student soon.</pre>
