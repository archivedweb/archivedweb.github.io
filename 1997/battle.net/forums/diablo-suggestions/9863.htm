<pre>I have gone and looked at the stuff for Ultima 2. Yea, it deffinetly 
has some great things, for a MUDD. That's all it is. Don't compare it 
to Diablo. Diablo is a game. Ultima Online is a MUDD. And that's that.
Oh, one other thing. The requirements for Ultima Online are unreal. I 
have a Pent. 120. I have on complaints about it. But, you need AT 
LEASt a pentium 133. Hell, what are you going to need that much for. 
I just think that the requirements are a bit much for Ultima Online.
  Now, as for a few things that I would like to see in Diablo 2. I 
have read other people's suggestions about Diablo 2. I find a lot of 
them interesting. I say without a doubt though, Diablo 2 needs to 
focus a lot on the multi player aspect. Don't try for the bells and 
whistles on single player. No one plays it. 
  I like the idea of the horses. I would personally like more story 
line, more scenery, and more characters. Those are my big ones. That 
and a lot of people will want to transfer their char from Diablo 1 to 
2. Make sure that they can do that.
