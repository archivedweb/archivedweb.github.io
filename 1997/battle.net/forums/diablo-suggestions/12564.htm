I've placed comments after each numbered suggestion.

&#62; Hi alls,
&#62; 
&#62; Here Ive tried to do a report on alls suggestions written on this 
&#62; forum since september 97.
&#62; I hope you'll like it. And Blizzard, answers us on this report.
&#62; For the fans, comments please, or add suggestion.. Thanks.
&#62; 
&#62;      1)The ability to customize a new character class with an 
&#62;      included editor.

I don't think that this would be very practical, because if this were 
possible, then people would create all different types of characters 
with varying statistics, and some characters would obviously be more 
powerful than others, which would unbalance gameplay in a multiplayer 
game, and in single player.  I'll give you an example to emphasize my 
point:  say someone created a level 1 warrior with 40 strength, and 
some other guy created a level 1 warrior with 80 strength.  It 
doesn't take a lot to figure out who would win between these two 
players in a multiplayer game.  Although it's a noble concept, it 
just isn't realistic, considering people could create extremely 
powerful characters, which would be more powerful than other people's 
characters.

&#62;      2)More interaction between characters, such as in Ultima &#62;   
   Online.

I'm not sure what you mean by this, could you please clarify this a 
bit more?
 
&#62;      3)Different character animations for each type of armor and not 
&#62;      just the class.

This is a great suggestion.  That's one of the biggest 
dissapointments in Diablo, that there's hardly no distinction between 
the different types of items, armor, and weapons that one wears.  I 
really wish that Blizzard North will change this in Diablo 2.

&#62;      4)Many more unique types of weapons instead of the same graphic 
&#62;      for several.

Same as previous comment.

&#62;      5)Shops and other buildings should be increased to have &#62;    
  multiple blacksmiths, magic shops, etc.

I do believe that this is Blizzard North's intention.  I'm pretty 
sure that Blizzard stated on their home page that there will be more 
shops in each of the 4 towns in Diablo 2.  If not, then this should 
definitely be considered.

&#62;      6) To completely stop cheating on Battle.net and turn it into 
&#62;      something like Ultima Online with a &#34;world.&#34;

Again, I'm not sure what exactly you mean by this statement.  How 
would this eliminate cheating?  I haven't played Ultima Online, so I 
don't know what you mean by this.  If you could clarify this with a 
little more detail, that would be helpful.

&#62;      7)There should be many more multi player quests that really 
&#62;      need people to work together as a team.

True, there is not much of a co-operative gaming technique in Diablo.

&#62;     8) There should be other races besides humans to play with, such 
&#62;     as elfes and dwarves.

If this will be the case, they should be npc's, not players, because 
humans would kick their butt, unless they have some super duper 
qualities.

&#62;     9) Blacksmiths should be able to have customized weapons put in 
&#62;     an order. For example, you determine the strengths, and magic, 
&#62;     in fonction your gold and notoriety.

I'm not sure what you're saying here.  If you're saying that 
blacksmith's should sell their stuff in a categorized manner, then I 
totally agree, such as a list of swords, a list of daggers, etc.

&#62;      10) incorpore a notoriety system. If the players is a pk, he   
&#62;      lost a part of notoriety. If he complete a quest, or help &#62;  
    another player, he obtain a bonus notoriety.

This might be cool.

&#62;      11) incorporate a thief

Yes, a thief would be cool, he/she could steal from npc's, but not 
from other players.

&#62;      12) More weapons such as throwing daggers, pikes/spears, &#62;   
   poisons, hell a rock too!

Yup, sounds good.  I've suggested many new weapons in the past, and 
these are a part of them.  More new weapons would be nice, like 
slingshots, whips, spears, molotov cocktails, lances, crossbows, 
throwing knives, shurikens, blow guns that shoot poisoned darts, etc.

&#62;      13) More creative traps such as pitfalls and other Indiana &#62; 
     Jones' spoofs.

Oh yeah!  The traps in Diablo are not much of a challenge, they might 
take off a hit point or two, but nothing serious.  They are quite 
tame actually.  Deadlier traps is a must for Diablo 2, such as 
Guillotines, poisoned arrows/darts, pitfalls with spikes, loose stone 
tiles that collapse once stepped on, etc.

&#62;     14) Multiple ways to get killed, including decapitations, etc. 
&#62;     Everyone wants gore! :)

Yes, this would be nice; currently there's only one way to die, and 
that is that you collapse on the floor with a pool of blood slowly 
oozing from your cold, dead body.  Maybe an exploding barrel would 
blow you to bits, a guillotine would chop your head off, an arrow 
ripping through your chest with blood squirting out.  There are so 
many possibilities.

&#62;      15)An online bounty hunter building where it is possible to 
&#62;      post bounties and where to claim them as well.

There are channels on Bnet for this, but this might be a nice 
alternative.  I wonder how this could be worked out.

&#62;      16) give us the possibilty to build our own house, dungeon, a 
&#62;      labyrinth editor.

This isn't really the purpose of Diablo, to build houses or dungeons. 
The purpose is to track down demons and slaugther them, and 
eventually making the world a better place to live, free from the 3 
prime evils of hell.  A labyrinth editor is not realistic, 
considering Diablo uses a random level generator, and I'm sure they 
will stick with this engine in Diablo 2, because they haven't 
mentioned anything about creating a whole new game engine for Diablo 
2.

&#62;     17) An online bank so we wouldn't have to have tons of gold in 
&#62;     our inventory all the time.

I really like this idea, a bank would be awesome.  This would really 
free lots of inventory space for all players.  Whenever you get back 
to town, you can deposit the money in the bank, and the next time you 
play a game, you go back to the same bank, and the amount of gold 
that you saved from last game is still there.

&#62;      18)To be able to hunt down demons or monsters and embed their 
&#62;      soul's energy into a rune weapon.

Interesting.  This would be cool, but perhaps this ability should be 
reserved for the warlock/mage/witch/magician/sorcerer characters.

&#62;      19) to be able to turn our character into a evil character. I 
&#62;      like this idea.

Actually, when I suggested this, I had in mind the possibility of 
choosing either an evil or a good character when you first create 
your character, in addition to choosing the gender of your character. 
 Great idea though.  Take the warrior as an example, you can choose 
the warrior to be either good or evil, and either male or female.  
Attributes would be the same, but the good and evil have different 
skills and abilities.

&#62;      20)To be able to have two weapon configurations stored so you 
&#62;      could press a button to alter your attack.

I've suggested many times before that there should be more than one 
method of attack.  In Diablo, there's basically just one form of 
attack, which is slash from right to left (which is very monotonous). 
The attack should vary and be randomized, with slashes from right to 
left, left to right, diagonal, vertical,horizontal slashes and 
thrust/stab, combined with jumping and ducking.  The same movements 
would be applied to blocks, so you can block the same attacks.  More 
experience one has, the better he/she is at attacking and blocking.

&#62;     21) Some natural enemies like lions, snake, etc. AND have human 
&#62;     enemies such as vagabonds or wild warriors.

That would be cool, but they should be bigger than normal animals, 
since they are possessed by evil spirits, employing greater powers.

&#62;     22) To have dungeons which actually go UP. For example a tall 
&#62;     temple to conquer.

That's another thing lacking in Diablo, no quests or battles above 
ground level.  There should be temples and mage towers and 
mountaineous areas.

&#62;      23)Be able to purchase horses to travel between towns faster 
&#62;      (sounds like UO ). But not down into the dungeon whit the &#62;  
    horse.

I like the idea of horses, but they shouldn't be limited to town, 
they should be able to be used in dungeons as well.  Blizzard has 
responded to this idea, and Pat N. said that he had forwarded the 
idea to the programmers for consideration.

&#62;      24)There should be &#34;counter&#34; spells such as ice or snow 
&#62;      to counter spells such as firewall.

Yes, definitely.  There are many fire based spells, but no snow based 
spells, what's up with that?  Considering the name of the company is 
Blizzard, one would almost expect them to add some ice/snow/water 
type spells, which would be very cool.

&#62;     25) There needs to be an option to have two one handed weapons 
&#62;     at once like in some other RPG series.

This is a great idea, but only really powerful warriors, such as 
barbarians and vikings should be able to wield 2 weapons at the same 
time, such as 2 small axes, 2 shorts swords, etc.

&#62;     26) Weapons upgrades would be a nice addition. The items could 
&#62;     be embued with magic or something similar.

That would be neat, to have a sorcerer enchant an item of some sort, 
but there should be a limit as to how many times an item can be 
enchanted, or else the item could become WAY too powerful.

&#62;      27)Different hotkeys for spells such as F1 through F8 to help 
&#62;      out those sorcerors with many spells in combat.

I would like more hotkeys as well, but Pat N. said that they made 
only 4 hotkeys for the purpose of creating a challenge; you must 
choose wisely which 4 spells that you think will be the most 
effective against your enemies.  This adds to the strategy of the 
game, so that you have to think a little bit about which spells you 
should use in a certain situation, and not have all or many spells 
ready at your disposal.  Instead of having 8 hot keys for spells, how 
about having 4 hotkeys for spells and 4 for weapons?  That way you 
can quickly access 4 of your favorite weapons without the hassle of 
fumbling through your inventory while being killed by demons, and the 
other 4 hotkeys for your spells.

&#62;       28)If you pk someone and take their ear, it should include 
&#62;       their character info like their IP number or whatever to give 
&#62;       a definite description.

This might be a nice touch, but not that important.

&#62;     29) Everyone wants to create their own quests somehow, so why 
&#62;     not include a built in quest editor?!

This would be hard to do, considering the way the game works.  There 
are built in codes that correspond to the quests, like after 
completing a quest you receive a unique item.  Take King Leoric's 
quest for example, how in the heck would you create a quest that 
corresponds to King Leoric's Tomb?  The only way that I see that this 
is possible is by programming the code into files on the Diablo cd or 
on the hard drive, which is created by the Blizzard North 
programmers, but I don't see how this could be created by regular 
gamers.  A quest editor is practical and easy to use in a game such 
as Starcraft, but in Diablo this just wouldn't work, unless they 
totally rewrite the game engine, making it similar to Starcraft or 
Warcraft.  Leave the quest making up to Blizzard North, let them do 
what they're best at.

&#62;     30) When making a character it should be possible to change them 
&#62;     physically like their hair color, etc.

The only thing that you should be able to change should the color of 
your character's clothes, such as pants and shirt, as to 
differentiate between different players on Battle.net.  Hair color 
wouldn't do any good, considering you can barely see the hair color 
on the characters.

&#62;      31)You should be able to have up to 8 people in multiplayer and 
&#62;      have built-in AI players to assist you.

I agree, there should be 8 players in a game, but the game creator 
should be able to choose how many players that are allowed in a game, 
like warcraft for example, you can choose either a 2 player, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, or 8 player game.  The game creator should also be able to kick 
and ban a player from his/her game, if someone is cheating, being 
annoying or just being rude to other people in the game.  Like I also 
suggested before, there should be random npc's that can help you out 
on a quest or whatever, but the npc has hit points, so he/she 
wouldn't last forever, and the npc should have special 
spells/abilities/skills.

&#62;      32)Each weapon should have different attack modes such as two 
&#62;      or one handed each being a different attack power.

Yes, two handed weapons should have more powerful and different 
attacks than one handed weapons.  The bodily harm inflicted upon all 
foes should be depicted grahpically different for each type of 
weapon, such as when attacking with bow and arrows, the arrows should 
actually stay in the enemy's flesh, and mauls should crush bones, and 
swords would cut open the flesh, spilling blood and guts.

&#62;      33)The mages should be able to morph into various creatures 
&#62;      instead of simply making one in a spell.

I don't know if you read my post a long time ago, which had a list of 
20 different characters.  On this list I had a character called a 
shape shifter, and this character would gain a new shape every ten 
levels or so, and be able to shift into the different shapes whenever 
he/she wants to.  Being able to stay as one particular shape would 
depend upon many factors, such as hit points and experience of the 
character.  The mage should not have this power, the mage should have 
other powers besides this.

&#62;      34)Day and night need to be introduced; shops could close and 
&#62;      monsters could be different.

Day and night would be cool; this could be random, like the dungeons, 
sometimes it's at night, sometimes it's daytime, and this would have 
consequences, like you mentioned:  shops close, monsters at night are 
different from the ones in daytime, etc.

&#62;      35) For PKers, instead of having a huge inventory full of ears, 
&#62;      you could have an &#34;ear necklace.&#34;  Pretty sick :)

This might be cool for those people who like to carry ears around 
their necks on an amulet.

&#62;     36) Weather for surface battles, similar to night and day, could 
&#62;     affect things such as attacks and monsters.

Yes, there should definitely be weather effects, such as rain, snow, 
hot sun, wind, etc., and this could depend upon the seasons.

&#62;      37)Those high level warriors with crazy 1000 point fireballs 
&#62;      need to be stopped to make things more proportional.

Cheaters must be stopped at all costs, because cheating sucks.

&#62;     38) A new type of quest, a rescue quest, would be good since a 
&#62;     person would have to escort the POWs out of the dungeon - a       
challenge!

A rescue quest would be cool.

&#62;     39) Choose a gender when creating a new character, be it male or 
&#62;     female.

Pat N. has said that they are considering this, he responded saying 
that he has forwarded the idea to the Blizzard North programmers.

&#62;Well, i guess it s all... Thanks for to read this.
&#62;Ans a special thanks at Warnet.com, and diablo2citadel, and alls 
fans 
&#62;on diablo forum.

&#62; Pat, or Blizzard could you do the point on this suggestion? And give 
&#62; us news please...The waiting for
&#62; D2 is too longggggggggg.....
&#62; 
&#62; Regards X

Thanks for your time, I know this post has grown to become quite a 
long post, I hope you managed to read through it all.
