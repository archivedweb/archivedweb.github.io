<pre>	I know everyone is tired of hearing about Mac users worrying about 
weather Mac Daiblo will have TCP/IP support or not but the only way 
Blizzard will know how strongly Mac players want TCP/IP in Mac Diablo 
is for Mac players to tell Blizzard. This is the SUGGESTION forum so 
we have every right to make SUGGESTIONS here. If the TCP/IP topic is 
getting on your nerves don't read any TCP/IP posts. It's not to 
difficult. With regards to Steel(Mac)'s post I to have hear that Mac 
Diablo will not have TCP/IP support built in. TCP/IP King, if you 
need TCP/IP just to get onto battle.net then why is it not going to 
built in? I'm pretty sure my source is the same as Steel's but (in 
case it's not), my source is VERY reliable as well. Blizzard, TCP/IP 
is very important to Mac players. We want a place where we can play 
multiplayer games without having to deal with cheaters (pkillers 
don't really bother me). The last time I checked battle.net was not a 
cheat free place to play Diablo on. One of the main reasons I am 
planning on purchasing Mac Diablo is it's multiplayer feature. I 
don't want to have to play on battle.net and be constantly abused by 
cheaters. If TCP/IP is not built into Diablo then there it is VERY 
LIKELY I will not be buying it. I have enjoyed the Warcraft series 
very much and I hope to enjoy Diablo as well but if there is no 
TCP/IP support then I may not even consider buying it.
