39 ) incorporate the gender male/female for each character

&#62; Hi alls,
&#62; 
&#62; Here Ive tried to do a report on alls suggestions written on this 
&#62; forum since september 97.
&#62; I hope you'll like it. And Blizzard, answers us on this report.
&#62; For the fans, comments please, or add suggestion.. Thanks.
&#62; 
&#62;      1)The ability to customize a new character class with an 
&#62; included editor. 
&#62;      2)More interaction between characters, such as in Ultima Online. 
&#62;      3)Different character animations for each type of armor and not 
&#62; just the class.
&#62;      4)Many more unique types of weapons instead of the same graphic 
&#62; for several. 
&#62;      5)Shops and other buildings should be increased to have multiple 
&#62; blacksmiths, magic shops, etc. 
&#62;      6) To completely stop cheating on Battle.net and turn it into 
&#62; something like Ultima Online with a
&#62;      &#34;world.&#34; 
&#62;      7)There should be many more multi player quests that really need 
&#62; people to work together as a
&#62;      team. 
&#62;     8) There should be other races besides humans to play with, such 
&#62; as elfes and dwarves. 
&#62;     9) Blacksmiths should be able to have customized weapons put in 
&#62; an order. For example, you
&#62;      determine the strengths, and magic, in fonction your gold and 
&#62; notoriety
&#62;    10) incorpore a notoriety system. If the players is a pk, he lost 
&#62; a part of notoriety. If he complete a quest, or help another player, 
&#62; he      obtain a bonus notoriety 
&#62;      11) incorporate a thief
&#62;     12) More weapons such as throwing daggers, pikes/spears, poisons, 
&#62; hell a rock too!  
&#62;     13) More creative traps such as pitfalls and other Indiana Jones' 
&#62; spoofs. 
&#62;     14) Multiple ways to get killed, including decapitations, etc. 
&#62; Everyone wants gore! :) 
&#62;      15)An online bounty hunter building where it is possible to post 
&#62; bounties and where to claim them
&#62;      as well. 
&#62;      16) give us the possibilty to build our own house, dungeon, a 
&#62; labyrinth editor.
&#62;     17) An online bank so we wouldn't have to have tons of gold in 
&#62; our inventory all the time. 
&#62;      18)To be able to hunt down demons or monsters and embed their 
&#62; soul's energy into a rune
&#62;      weapon 
&#62;      19) to be able to turn our character into a evil character. I 
&#62; like this idea.
&#62;      20)To be able to have two weapon configurations stored so you 
&#62; could press a button to alter your
&#62;      attack. 
&#62;     21) Some natural enemies like lions, snake, etc. AND have human 
&#62; enemies such as vagabonds or
&#62;      wild warriors. 
&#62;     22) To have dungeons which actually go UP. For example a tall 
&#62; temple to conquer. 
&#62;      23)Be able to purchase horses to travel between towns faster ( 
&#62; sounds like UO ). But not down into the dungeon whit the horse
&#62;      24)There should be &#34;counter&#34; spells such as ice or snow 
&#62; to counter spells such as firewall. 
&#62;     25) There needs to be an option to have two one handed weapons at 
&#62; once like in some other RPG
&#62;      series. 
&#62;     26) Weapons upgrades would be a nice addition. The items could be 
&#62; embued with magic or
&#62;      something similar. 
&#62;      27)Different hotkeys for spells such as F1 through F8 to help 
&#62; out those sorcerors with many spells
&#62;      in combat. 
&#62;       28)If you pk someone and take their ear, it should include 
&#62; their character info like their IP number
&#62;      or whatever to give a definite description. 
&#62;     29) Everyone wants to create their own quests somehow, so why not 
&#62; include a built in quest
&#62;      editor?! 
&#62;     30) When making a character it should be possible to change them 
&#62; physically like their hair color,
&#62;      etc. 
&#62;      31)You should be able to have up to 8 people in multiplayer and 
&#62; have built-in AI players to assist
&#62;      you. 
&#62;      32)Each weapon should have different attack modes such as two or 
&#62; one handed each being a
&#62;      different attack power. 
&#62;      33)The mages should be able to morph into various creatures 
&#62; instead of simply making one in a
&#62;      spell. 
&#62;      34)Day and night need to be introduced; shops could close and 
&#62; monsters could be different. 
&#62;      35) For PKers, instead of having a huge inventory full of ears, 
&#62; you could have an &#34;ear necklace.&#34;
&#62;      Pretty sick :) 
&#62;     36) Weather for surface battles, similar to night and day, could 
&#62; affect things such as attacks and
&#62;      monsters. 
&#62;      37)Those high level warriors with crazy 1000 point fireballs 
&#62; need to be stopped to make things
&#62;      more proportional. 
&#62;     38) A new type of quest, a rescue quest, would be good since a 
&#62; person would have to escort the
&#62;      POWs out of the dungeon - a challenge! 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Well, i guess it s all... Thanks for to read this.
&#62; Ans a special thanks at Warnet.com, and diablo2citadel, and alls fans 
&#62; on diablo forum.
&#62; 
&#62; Pat, or Blizzard could you do the point on this suggestion? And give 
&#62; us news please...The waiting for
&#62; D2 is too longggggggggg.....
&#62; 
&#62; Regards X</pre>
