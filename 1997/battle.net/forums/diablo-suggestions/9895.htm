&#62; &#62; I have gone and looked at the stuff for Ultima 2. Yea, it deffinetly 
&#62; &#62; has some great things, for a MUDD. That's all it is. Don't compare it 
&#62; &#62; to Diablo. Diablo is a game. Ultima Online is a MUDD. And that's that.
&#62; &#62; Oh, one other thing. The requirements for Ultima Online are unreal. I 
&#62; &#62; have a Pent. 120. I have on complaints about it. But, you need AT 
&#62; &#62; LEASt a pentium 133. Hell, what are you going to need that much for. 
&#62; &#62; I just think that the requirements are a bit much for Ultima Online.
&#62; &#62;   Now, as for a few things that I would like to see in Diablo 2. I 
&#62; &#62; have read other people's suggestions about Diablo 2. I find a lot of 
&#62; &#62; them interesting. I say without a doubt though, Diablo 2 needs to 
&#62; &#62; focus a lot on the multi player aspect. Don't try for the bells and 
&#62; &#62; whistles on single player. No one plays it. 
&#62; &#62;   I like the idea of the horses. I would personally like more story 
&#62; &#62; line, more scenery, and more characters. Those are my big ones. That 
&#62; &#62; and a lot of people will want to transfer their char from Diablo 1 to 
&#62; &#62; 2. Make sure that they can do that.
&#62; 
Well, if you focus more on multiplayer then you cannot focus more on 
the storyline because if you keep diablo the way it is (by which I 
mean a game that you can start at the beginning of each time). If you 
want storyline then you need to keep the single player mode which 
posses a different challenge and is just a fun as the multiplayer 
mode. 

 I cannot agree with you about UO! How can you possibly say that uo 
is 
&#62; not a game! D and UO are both games. Diablo is anextremely
&#62; linear game. Sure the dungeon looks different everytime, but its 
&#62; still the same storyline. Diablo has great graphics, wonderful audio
&#62; and spells that look awsome, however I find it hard to even call it a 
&#62; true rpg. The only interaction between players is helping to kill 
&#62; or tryingto not get killed. How you act and what you do has almost no 
&#62; bearing on your character. Your actions have little or no 
&#62; consequences. UO will have a storyline, however from day1 of its 
&#62; release players will begin shaping the world(and I do mean shaping). 
&#62; You can design and build your own house! The world is HUGE. 750 gigs 
&#62; of space is used just to store the contents
&#62; of the world map. thousands of players will be interacting in the 
&#62; same game!(thats a little better than 4). UO is a game on a grand 
&#62; scale, where as Diablo is just a really nice game, but with some 
&#62; extremely serious flaws! Woe be to the people who did the in house 
&#62; beta testing of diablo. Obviously none of them tried to hack it! 
&#62; Diablo was a great game, but its days are wayning. It is no fun to 
&#62; always be on the lookout for cheaters everywhere you go. I don't mind 
&#62; if someone outright turns and murders my character, as long as they 
&#62; didn't cheat to do it. You will find that UO will be a far greater 
&#62; game in many ways then Diablo ever was. The only people who will stay 
&#62; on Diablo(if they have a choice) will be the folks who can't do 
&#62; anything right without cheating. I prefer a challenge, rather than a 
&#62; cheat.
&#62; 

You are assuming that everyone cheats. I do not cheat and I have 
found several people who do not cheat and I am finding more and more 
each time I play. There are legit players out there it is just that 
they don't brag quite as much as those who cheat. Diablo is not a 
role playing game because you don't really role play. You pick a 
character that is pre done and just get more and more gold to buy 
things with and find stuff to help your battles. That is not role 
playing. That is an action game. Diablo and Ultima Online have very 
little in common and the people who want to play a role playing game 
online will pay the $10/month (or whatever it will be +$45 for the 
game) and play it. The people whojust want a game they don't have to 
worry about as many things with and just want a good time will play 
Diablo.</pre>
