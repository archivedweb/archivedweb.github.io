&#62; &#62;    Ok this has nothing to do with sex and porno and stuff I just 
&#62; &#62; wanted to make you people read this. Regarding talking inside the 
&#62; &#62; game it really doesn't sound realistic that players can speak with 
&#62; &#62; each other from different levels as if they had TELEPATHY. Now that's 
&#62; &#62; an Idea for the next RPG you people are going to make.
&#62; 
&#62; All I have to say is that talking inisde the game is nessary for 
&#62; diablo beaues you can only play upto 4 players, and you need all the 
&#62; communication possible.  It would be silly If I had to cast a spell 
&#62; to talk to anthor player on a different level!
&#62; 
&#62; This would only work on a game like ultima online (which will pee all 
&#62; over diablo when relased) to talk to people in differn't towns or to 
&#62; find were people were last seen
&#62;  
&#62; &#62;    Talents. Talents are missing from the game only a single talent 
&#62; &#62; AKA skill are present per character class. The ability to gain talent 
&#62; &#62; would be nice.  talents should be learned from NPC's (non player 
&#62; &#62; characters) or from other players who already know talents but they 
&#62; &#62; should meet the requirements for a particular talent.
&#62; 
&#62; Yeah, that sounds cool, but I think youi should be able to have a 
&#62; talent in a certen spell after you have used it so much and have it 
&#62; in a certian level.  This would be something only the highest players 
&#62; go for!
&#62; 
&#62; &#62;    Character Classes, Abilities, and Attributes. The Attributes: 
&#62; &#62; Strength, Magic, Agility, and Endurance are very limited and has a 
&#62; &#62; broad scope. It would be nice if you could add some more character 
&#62; &#62; attributes so this would have a better feel and realism. Addictive as 
&#62; &#62; Diablo is, it is still lacking in the RPG area.
&#62; 
&#62; I don't think this need to be changed realy in diablo!
