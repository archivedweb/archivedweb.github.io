<pre>Hi everybody,

it is me again and I have to add a very important thing:

5. Shops. It was ALWAYS an annoyance to me that there wasn't someone 
building a shop in the dungeons in EVERY roleplaying game I have 
played so far. A random event like a travelling merchant who sold 
some magical goodies or a shop which set up in one of the dungeon 
levels would be a nice thing. Probably this shop might have 
outrageously high prices on common goods like healing potions... and 
he might just have some good items stored as well.

6. Characters. Maybe you should consider NPC (non player characters, 
for those who are not accustomed to the language of roleplaying 
games) wandering around the dungeon. Maybe you could have a warrior 
fighting monsters, who would accompany the first player who helped 
him for a while....Then again, this would probably be a bit too 
delicate to program, so don't do this, if you aren't absolutely sure 
it would be a good element of the game. 
And besides if the NPC's always acted the same like some 
&#34;satellite&#34; add-on for the player they would soon get boring 
anyway. But I trust your creativity to come up with an imaginative 
solution to this idea :)

With regards,
Kai

P.S.: I am staying at my bro's place, that's why the host doesn't fit 
to my e-mail address...</pre>
