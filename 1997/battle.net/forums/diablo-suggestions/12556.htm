&#62; Hi everybody,
&#62; 
&#62; it is me again and I have to add a very important thing:
&#62; 
&#62; 5. Shops. It was ALWAYS an annoyance to me that there wasn't someone 
&#62; building a shop in the dungeons in EVERY roleplaying game I have 
&#62; played so far. A random event like a travelling merchant who sold 
&#62; some magical goodies or a shop which set up in one of the dungeon 
&#62; levels would be a nice thing. Probably this shop might have 
&#62; outrageously high prices on common goods like healing potions... and 
&#62; he might just have some good items stored as well.
&#62; 
&#62; 6. Characters. Maybe you should consider NPC (non player characters, 
&#62; for those who are not accustomed to the language of roleplaying 
&#62; games) wandering around the dungeon. Maybe you could have a warrior 
&#62; fighting monsters, who would accompany the first player who helped 
&#62; him for a while....Then again, this would probably be a bit too 
&#62; delicate to program, so don't do this, if you aren't absolutely sure 
&#62; it would be a good element of the game. 
&#62; And besides if the NPC's always acted the same like some 
&#62; &#34;satellite&#34; add-on for the player they would soon get boring 
&#62; anyway. But I trust your creativity to come up with an imaginative 
&#62; solution to this idea :)
&#62; 
&#62; With regards,
&#62; Kai
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.: I am staying at my bro's place, that's why the host doesn't fit 
&#62; to my e-mail address...

Sounds to much like Ultima.</pre>
