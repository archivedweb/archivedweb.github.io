&#62; Horses or other strange animals that you can ride.  You could find 
&#62; these after beating a boss or buying them.  You should not get as 
&#62; much money when you kill creatures in higher levels... then it get's 
&#62; silly. 
&#62; 
&#62; It would be neat if you could target specific body parts on people 
&#62; and creatures.  And stores that you can go INTO.  
&#62; 
&#62; t'would be neat to be able to jump and roll around and have different 
&#62; strategies that you learn with level ups.  
&#62; 
&#62; LOTS of towns and different character classes.  
&#62; 

Andrew! I agree with you completly, but i think there should be a 
thief class, and wizards should be able to have familiars, little 
creatures that fight with, and for, you.
&#62; Some sort of hotel kind of thing that you start out at on battle.net. 
&#62;  It would reckognize something like your ip and open it.  In your 
&#62; room you could sleep (which you should need), store items in a chest 
&#62; or something.  This inn could be when you ENTER battle.net or when 
&#62; you join a game.
&#62; 
&#62; Optional town kill.
&#62; 
&#62; SUPER NO CHEATING... SUPER!!!
&#62; 
&#62; Different guilds which are located in buildings that you can enter 
&#62; and socialize.  
&#62; 
&#62; I'm sure that I have much more to say but I can't think of it now.  
&#62; It would be really neat to have these things... and add some strategy 
&#62; to Diablo.
