<pre>Traps - the most annoying and cheesy elements in any RPG/adventure.  
How to design a good trap without ruining play enjoyment?

Obviously the simple traps like the exploding chest, hole-in-the-wall-
that-shoots-things are effective, but what if the spell traps had 
more effects, like slowing the character?  A slow trap combined with 
the release of a dozen or so nasties could SERIOUSLY threaten most 
characters, who are used to reacting with a certain speed normally.  
Or, what if under a &#34;berserk&#34; spell, no magic could be cast?  
Pity the unfortunate mage who cannot remedy the situation quickly 
enough.  The standard &#34;location traps&#34; can also mete out 
damage using entertaining graphics, i.e. swinging scythes, the 
&#34;telephone pole on a chain&#34; (remember Jedi and the Ewok 
traps?) or a sickly green cloud of gas...

  A second type of trap is the movement trap.  This trap moves the 
character to a place where... unfortunate... things happen.  For 
example, what if a character was teleported into the center of a room 
full of exploding barrels?  I know that's kind of tame, but other 
variants can include a tilting ramp, room or hall which sends the 
character down into a combat room and more.  The pit trap is a 
classic example which moves the characters down into a place with 
spikes, carniverous fish or whatever.  Pit traps might not be 
terribly practical in D2, but an equivalent might be a ceiling-net 
which temporarliy disables the character... This type of trap 
generally causes irritation with players, however, since they must go 
back to wherever they were and whatever they were doing before they 
were moved.

  The third major type of trap is the isolation trap.  This causes 
the character to become isolated either from their comrades, their 
avenue of escape or from their primary abilities.  Isolation traps 
include hallways with sections which swing out, isolating portions of 
the hallway, areas of dungeons in which town portal does not work 
(imagine the players shock!) and places where magic does not work 
(i.e. evil shrines or the like - these obviously MUST be 
destroyed!!!).

Can't linger long today.  Probably finish tomorrow.</pre>
