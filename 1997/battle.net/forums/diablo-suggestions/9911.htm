<pre>All,

Just a few spell ideas. PLUS an idea for a modified magic system. 
These are essentially ripped from AD&D.

 - Blades of Doom: a wall or square of whirling, levitating swords 
appears and slices those who walk through. Triple-Immunes beware

- Wall of Resistance: An energy wall that lets no one (other than 
teleporters) pass by for the duration. It blocks spells and effects 
too.

- Sphere of Resistance: a short duration total enclosure barrier that 
prevents everything except teleportation.

- Cone of Energy Drain: a blue-black cone of energy that sucks the 
heat out of opponents (i.e. cold-based damage). OPTIONAL: The more 
your fire resistance, the more this hurts you.

Finally, an idea I had long ago that I posted: generic magic system. 
Let there be spells that can consist of combinations of any of the 
following: a) area, appearance, sound, result. Therefore you could 
have &#34;chain healing&#34; that sounded like fire and looked like 
green clouds. Or you could have &#34;phasing guardian&#34; which 
floats in one spot lookig like an immobile charged bolt, but it 
shoots what appears to be firebolts at targets. When they hit, the 
target is phased. OR perhaps &#34;wall of stone curse&#34; ... should 
be self-explanatory. HOWEVER, the weird combos would be generated in 
the form of unique books  ... not every player would have every weird 
combo he wanted ... the standard spells would remain the same. A 
player could have up to 5 unique spells at any one time, and perhaps 
some new elixir or tablet would let him up the spell levels. 
Whatever. Anyway, if the graphics/sound/internal engine could handle 
the various appearances and sounds and effects generically, then no 
special code for each spell. Just appearance, area, sound, and 
results.
