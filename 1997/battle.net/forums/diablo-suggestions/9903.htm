&#62; I have been looking through the Battle.net and you know What I heard 
&#62; everyone is talking about Ultima Online so here is my Idea make a 
&#62; Game named &#34;Diablo the next step into hell.&#34; and you should 
&#62; have these features.
&#62; 
&#62; 1. Make it so that you can Change your characters features. for 
&#62; example I would make my self. Black hair, Brown Eyes and a flat nose 
&#62; (thats what I look like.) and be able to pick your Skills ( 2 in the 
&#62; beginning). and What Race you wish to be, and let it make it so that 
&#62; each race has some special skills to pick from, some limits (I love 
&#62; to be elves in the AD&D game.) And more Classes and be able to make 
&#62; mixes of some Classes here are some examples (Rangers, Theifs - let 
&#62; them get two times more money than all other class, illusionists.) 
&#62; 
&#62; 2. Take of the town junk (no I don't meen to not have town,  I want 
&#62; lots of towns cities and so on.) and battle mode is allowed in town 
&#62; its the dreams of a PK to be able to back stab some one in the back 
&#62; while he is buy some thing. and make it so there can never be cheats 
&#62; for I don't see cheating programs in Warcraft II, If it was because 
&#62; the codes then let them use codes its way better than any Hacks and 
&#62; people who uses hacks some times get there game disdroyed. and let 
&#62; there be a arena where we can place bets on people dueling for its 
&#62; cool to have duel. 
&#62; 
&#62; 3. More than just 4 player in a game for the new Diablo II make it 
&#62; like Unlimited or 100 as a limit. and make it all one huge quest or 
&#62; you can get small quests from NPCs. and Leave the PKS they are a 
&#62; great part of the game. and We should not have 1/7 having a Arena for 
&#62; Dueling. And you can go in Inns or Camping for if you want to still 
&#62; play when you have to Log of  a game. and be able to tame animals and 
&#62; neutral Monsters. and yes more monsters a lot more!!!!!!! and if you 
&#62; are playing in one area for a long time you cna build houses or get a 
&#62; job to earn some good money and don't make easy money unless you kill 
&#62; some one that is very useful or a boss but don't make money so scarce 
&#62; that every one have to PK to live. and make it that it has ships etc. 
&#62; and a whole World to playing instead of a small town with 5 people 
&#62; living (Alot better!!!!!) and let it be that you can chop up a tree 
&#62; or a guy you just killed to sell his meat or the wood. and have it so 
&#62; we can have money bags I hate to fill my inv with money that I need 
&#62; to buy a ax with. and that if we can buy horses or similar we can let 
&#62; the horse carry things and also he can die too. We must have bows 
&#62; with limited arrows for that  it is way too unRPG like and we should 
&#62; be able to refill or a archer loaded with wood can make some by him 
&#62; self. 
&#62; 
&#62; 4. The chat room I have a great Idea for the Chat room. we enter a 
&#62; town with rooms and at the beginning we have a place where a Blizzard 
&#62; manager is and we can buy houses for our characters. and where we can 
&#62; buy Guild Halls so we can talk (Passworded) and we can leave notes to 
&#62; each other like some one can enter as a Guest and leave a note about 
&#62; he want to join the clan. (and make it take a while to build a Guild 
&#62; house ( and let us be able to see it in work and let use be able to 
&#62; add stuff to it like a small shop or a trading station would be good. 
&#62; and the blacksmith can make a duplicate of something for a charge. 
&#62; for example 1/5 of what the price he would buy it for. and we can 
&#62; leave items specially for a player and a training place would be cool 
&#62; to train your charcater properly. 
&#62; 
&#62; 5. and make it more like a RPG. Multiple endings would be cool and of 
&#62; course we can't forget a lot more good weapons. and instead  of a 
&#62; warrior must be a guy you can have him as a woman and a wizard gal 
&#62; will be cool. and be able to back up your character not as a cheat 
&#62; but as a part of a game. and be able to leave things in your house. 
&#62; so you don't loose them and you don't have to throw away things. and 
&#62; for the non-Pks will be able to kick Pks out after they land their 
&#62; first attack on some one. and here are some suggestions I picked up 
&#62; That I like:
&#62; A ninja that can jump out of Shadows to kill (Specially made for 
&#62; PKS.) 
&#62; Allow you to take a special part of the Boss or a Person after you 
&#62; kill him (like tooth but not the private Parts AWWWWW)
&#62; and make the attractions like this:
&#62; -Strength - Physical power
&#62; -Dexterity - Nimbleness, agility
&#62; -Constitution - Durability, health
&#62; -Intelligence - Knowledge, overall smartness
&#62; -Wisdom - Common sense, perception
&#62; -Charisma - Good looks, personality
&#62; Read <a href="http://www.Battle.net/forums/diablo-suggestions/9765.htm">http://www.Battle.net/forums/diablo-suggestions/9765.htm</a> 's post 
&#62; on the Classes.
&#62; 
&#62; Alot more to come post your sugestions, and cast your votes to 
&#62; Blizzard of this happening.
&#62; 
&#62; 

Wow you have a lot of ideas here. I posted something like this once 
and 
had them thrown back at me. Since then ive accepted that people
dont want to play D&D, they want to play diablo. pure and simple.
Hey rolling up your character is good. I hate the fact that you 
grabbed
D&D and just transfered it to the PC. 100 people?!?!?!?!?! that is 
crazy.
Think what the lag would be like. 4 players isnt very much but 8 is 
too
much for me. 6 is quite good cos if you increase the # of players then
you have to increase the difficulty which means more monsters on 
screen at once which leads to a big clutter of sprites. More 
monster?!?!
remember that the most of the monsters in diablo were conjured up
from Prince Albrecht imagination and now that he is dead they no
longer exsist. New monster is what we need. Having individual looks
is a good idea but you have to make it easy for people who just wanna
get into the game. A random features option would fit that bill very 
nicely. Also when other players join your game they would have to 
load the character features from the CD which may be tediously slow
for some. I like the tavern thingy. But how about this. . . . . Each 
tavern
is actually a different channel in B.NET, eg. &#34;Retail Diablo 
USA1&#34;.
Or these could be all the tables in the tavern. So when you switch 
channels is like u are moving to a new table in the tevern. When you 
go to look at the available games you are actually looking at a
poster on the wall that lists all the available games. If you wanna 
make
it more D&D style then open up the diablo world and explore the west 
and east. look for long lost treasures and creatures. save villagers 
from
an army of orcs. the diablo world is totally untapped and anything is
possible.I dont think that you would be the old adventurer who 
&#34;stupidly&#34;
shoved the soul stone into his head. You could be totally fresh. Maybe
Diablo crept his way up through the adventurers soul and possessed 
him.
slow the plot would be explained to you till finally you learn that 
the
adventurer has released mephetos and baal from the desert and now 
you must fight all three. this game is doomed to stay linear cos of 
its 
action content. RPGs are slow and at times can get boring. If people
want to play an online RPG they can enjoy Ultima Online which ive 
heard is very HUGE. 

What im saying is you can add D&D aspects but you must keep the game
action packed and fast moving in all areas. I bet every out there 
hates 
looking the stairs down in diablo. I bet they prefer kicking monster 
butt
and watching the monster's blood spill every where. Am i right??????

well just consider what ive said and dont take it too critically.
Too bad there isnt a online dungeons and dragons game. havent 
played for a loooooooong time. </pre>
