&#62; I really don't understand why the part after you killed someone they

&#62; pride factor..how about the ability to chose what you want after you 
&#62; kill someone ..like a little screen comes up that lets you choose 
&#62; from there weapon or there armor..it doesn't say what they have so 
&#62; its the luck of the draw...it would make pking  a little more fun! 
&#62; ..by the way if you flame me for being a pk i could care less...Pking 
&#62; was ment to be in the game so live with it..and pks have rights to 
&#62; make suggestions such as this..=)



Well, I believe they took out the drop all your items when you're pked
part because it's not fair for a legit player to lose all his/her 
items to a player killer who is using hacked items and/or some cheat 
patch.  I think pking would be an ok thing if there was some outside 
chance you could actually kill the guy trying to pk you! But as of 
now I don't think theres many legit pkers on battle.net so YOU live 
with the fact that you can't steal someones items by using cheats. 

P.S.- isn't it fun enough for murderous a-holes like you just to 
destroy someone elses good time?
