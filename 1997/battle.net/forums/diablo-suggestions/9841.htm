<pre>I'm just adding some ideas to my other message.  Another idea is I 
think it would be really cool if you were walking along in hell (or 
any lvl)  and some guy was in the corner and he sells you stuff that 
would be really cool instead of opening a portal up to town  (but of 
course you couldn't have one per lvl that would be stupid.)  
Second idea is, I think it would be really cool to be able to disign 
your character (eyes, hair etc.) but keep the basic classes warrior, 
rogue, and the mage.  I was thinking sorta like Ultima how you design 
a character (but please don't make the game like ultima cause it 
sux.)  This would be a really good thing for battle.net because you 
could tell who people were better.  I've had people come try to pk me 
when they had the wrong guy!  Makes me mad they usually appologize 
though.
Plus I would try as hard as i could to try to make no flaws in the 
game such as the duping thing and certain cheats.  

Thanks for listening,
