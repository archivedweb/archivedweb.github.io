<blockquote>
<pre>Today's suggestion is simple: provide a battle arena in one of the 
towns in D2 where special combats take place.  This will allow 
characters to challenge each other and to conduct battles without 
penalties, as I will explain momentarily.

If a special battle area (perhaps a certain building allows entry to 
the arena - or even several DIFFERENT arenas?  Hey, sometimes I even 
impress myself!) can be set aside from the rest of the game, several 
changes to the standard combat sequence could be worked in to 
maintain the status quo:
   1.   No experience is gained at the conclusion of the battle
   2.   No items are generated or won at the conclusion of the battle
   3.   When a character is killed, the &#34;scatter items&#34; 
command is skipped - their stuff doesn't fly off of their corpse when 
they die in the arena.
   4.   When the battle is over and all participants on one side are 
dead or incapacitated, the &#34;deceased&#34; can be automatically 
&#34;resurrected&#34; by the Arena staff.  The staff could also sweep 
away debris and scatter fresh sawdust.

As I see it, the Arena could be entered by several different 
characters at a time who could then slug out their differences in the 
time-honored tradition of combat to the &#34;death.&#34;  With the 
addition of a Ranking board and a Challenge board for BattleNet, I 
think the arena would be an outstanding addition.  Even in the single-
player version, NPCs in the town may challenge the characters to test 
their readiness or, in very special circumstances, the NPC might even 
give the characters a special reward if the character can beat them 
(or a designated champion) in the arena.

For very special events, maybe a mass-combat of a dozen or more 
adversaries could square off... although that's probably too much to 
ask.</pre>
