&#62; Today's suggestion is fairly mundane, but may be fairly significant.  
&#62; I would suggest that character &#34;conditions&#34; be implemented.  
&#62; These change your character's status, i.e. haste, slow, poison, 
&#62; stealth, shield and so forth.  The conditions could be brought on by 
&#62; spell, potion, monster, shrine, character class ability or what-have-
&#62; you.  Character class abilities could include &#34;berserk&#34; for 
&#62; fighter to go into haste/killing spree, &#34;meditation&#34; for 
&#62; wizard to recharge mana, or &#34;stealth&#34; for rogue.  Of these 
&#62; conditions, perhaps the &#34;stealth&#34; condition may be the most 
&#62; interesting.
&#62; 
&#62; One major flaw in D1 was a fundamental inability to sneak up on your 
&#62; foes.  This meant that whenever you entered a room, the beasties 
&#62; gathered therein would storm you until one or the other lay dead on 
&#62; the floor.  A &#34;stealth&#34; condition would allow a character to 
&#62; sneak into a room without rousing the inhabitants, then attack just 
&#62; one monster, disposing of them before the others really know what's 
&#62; going on.  If the character can then make an escape and re-enter 
&#62; &#34;stealth&#34; mode, the monsters might stop tracking them, too!
&#62; 
&#62; As I envision the &#34;stealth&#34; mode, it would not be 
&#62; invisibility, just limit the monsters' awareness of the character.  
&#62; On the 'Net, a band of thieves could finally be effective in wiping 
&#62; out rooms of baddies, but they would not be taking out other players 
&#62; through an unfair advantage.
&#62; 
&#62; Let me know your thoughts!

Great idea about the &#34;conditions&#34;. The stealth also is a good 
one.
The monsters always spot you even when you are behind them.</pre>
