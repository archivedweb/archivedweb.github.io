&#62; It's ridiculous to say that player fighting is bad because you lose. 
&#62; People play sports even though there is always a losing team...  
&#62; Having to watch your back puts an element in the game that adds 
&#62; excitement.  Running about invincible killing people is childish and 
&#62; makes for poor gameplay, but playing in a group where a single guy 
&#62; may want to take on the others in the party when he becomes overcome 
&#62; with greed for his share of gold (or whatever) is interesting.  It 
&#62; places a stake on your time investment.  It makes you ask yourself: 
&#62; &#34;Do I think the character I have invested all this time and 
&#62; effort into can cut it against his character?&#34;  
&#62; 
&#62; Frankly, I am disappointed player fighting has had such a poor 
&#62; turnout.  When I first read about the game and the possibility of 
&#62; characters battling it out, I got excited with images of teamwork to 
&#62; defeat another set characters.  But instead, I come here and read 
&#62; posts from whiney kids who are afraid to drop their gold.  I think 
&#62; you should drop everything (gold and items) when you are killed by 
&#62; another player.  If you are getting attacked by an invincible 
&#62; cheater, then quit the game before he kills you.  Think about your 
&#62; character, make him the best you can, and pit your character against 
&#62; another.  It's fun, and it's challenging.  You'll find most other 
&#62; players are far more difficult than Diablo ever will be.

While I do not disagree with PKing (it is part of the game and should 
stay), I do not see why most people who pk think it is something that 
is particularly hard or requires some strategy. I mean how hard is it 
to join someone who is playing. Fight some monsters for a while and 
then when you see there Hp dip a little low cast a firewall while 
they are looking at there inventory and slash/shoot/cast at them when 
they are not looking. Pking is not more of a challenge then fighting 
the monsters in the game the only result is that someone is affected 
instead of a computer.....</pre>
