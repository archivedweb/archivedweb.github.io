&#62; and spoilt by hackers, ill bet my PC on it. Besides there are only 16 
&#62; levels, and I played it so much I allmost went through all the common 
&#62; types of randomisation for the levels. I know its a community and 
&#62; that, however we can all move on to better things now, how about 
&#62; Ultima Online. I think that will surpass Diablo in every way. don't 
&#62; get me wrong, I enjoyed Diablo in it's prime sadly it's days are up. 
&#62; This is a case in point, how many of the suggestions have actually 
&#62; been favoured by Blizzard: answer NONE. ROLL ON ULTIMA ONLINE PEOPLE.
Very negative outlook. You forget that there are still many people 
who are new to Diablo. Also some people like different things and for 
some Diablo is a great game even if something is better. Just because 
cookie dough ice cream is good does not make vanilla ice cream any 
less enjoyable.......
Blizzard does look at this chat room, just most of the posts are not 
worth recognition because they are whiney people who just want more 
powerful things..... 
Case in point is a point a little bit down dealing with what people 
want in Diablo 2. So in the future don't be so pissy and just let 
people enjoy the game. </pre>
