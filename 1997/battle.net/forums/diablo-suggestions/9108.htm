&#62; TO THE DISEARNING,
&#62; 
&#62; IT IS VERY DISCOURAGING TO HEAR ALL THE NEGATIVE CHAT ON BATTLE.NET.  
&#62; I PERSONALLY LOVE THIS GAME.  GROWING UP IN THE '80'S THIS WAS JUST 
&#62; WHAT I DREAMED OF.  I PLAYED D&D EVERYDAY AND PLAYED ON MY COMPUTER.  
&#62; WITH THE HOPES THAT GRAPHICS WOULD SOMEDAY LOOK LIKE THIS.  I COULD 
&#62; NOT HAVE DREAMED OF A BETTER GAME.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME OF THE 
&#62; PEOPLE OUT THIER TAKE MANY THINGS FOR GRANTED, EVEN OUR PLAY TOYS.  
&#62; WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMMING TO??

That Play Toys thing was a good point; however, many of us bought 
Diablo thinking it would have more than it actually did (e.g. unique 
figure gfx) and with no prospect of an add-on or announcements of a 
new patch that may add something (anything!) new, our toy is broken 
because of all the bullies and we all want to take it back...or get 
it fixed.</pre>
