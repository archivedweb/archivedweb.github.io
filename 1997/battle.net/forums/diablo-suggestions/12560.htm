&#62; come on, if we are trying to achieve as much realism as possible 
&#62; without screwing the 
&#62; game over, there need to be more restictions on spells. Like casting 
&#62; time, a sorceror 
&#62; (Or who ever) shouldn't be able to cast a Firebolt at the same speed 
&#62; of... oh say Apacalypse. 
&#62; Something that Blizzard tried to introduce was life draining on 
&#62; certain spells (Blood Star,
&#62; And Bone Spirit) but how abaout STAT reduction. Like casting a revive 
&#62; spell should take 
&#62; away some vitality (Or life, permanently) of the person being 
&#62; revived, and possibly 
&#62; taking away some strength or something for casting major spells.
&#62;  You get my point, 'twas just a thought... 


This seems like a good idea!....I dunno about permanently...I mean it 
does seem kinda crazy that the mage can cast all these spells this 
fast, but you also have to look at the fact that, if you had to take 
a few seconds more to cast spells that are the only ones effective 
against these massive crews of monsters (also a suggestion to 
Blizzard, to try to have the random dungeons not have large huge 
masses of monsters...if you are going to, don't make them so close 
together).  But maybe if like there was a temporary penalty to it, 
like oh i dunno...the more you cast the spells, the less acurate they 
are, so you can still cast like crazy, but you can't overkill on one 
monster...which would add more strategy to taking the time to maybe 
teleport back and recharge your &#34;accuracy&#34; before going back 
to fight the monsters.</pre>
