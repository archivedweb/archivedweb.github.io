<pre>If a sequel to Diablo is going to be made I have a few suggestions:

1)Enable a primary/secondary weapon hotkey. I think a hotkey that 
allows you to quickly switch between two weapons would be extremely 
useful. For instance, if you're using a sword as your primary weapon 
and you suddenly run into a group of the undead, you could hit the 
switch hotkey and switch from your sword to your mace, the secondary 
weapon. This would also be great when killing Blood Knights with your 
sword, then quickly switching to a bow to finish off the Advocates.

2)I think everyone would love an invisibility spell. There are so 
many possibilities to work with there. You could limit it however you 
want: have it use two points of mana for every second you're 
invisible, or you could have unlimited invisiblility, but become 
visible whenever you attack or cast a spell. Any way that you decide 
to make it, I'm sure players will find it useful.

3)I'd like to see a version of teleport that brings up the automap 
and allows you to click on a part of the map, and that is where you 
are teleported.

4)The messages in multiplayer are great, but how is it that a player 
in town can talk to players in the dungeon? I think the message 
function should only be available when you can see another player, or 
at least are within earshot. Maybe, shouting at another player might 
alert monsters nearby. I just don't think players could communicate 
with other players on different levels. Unless, they had a Telepathy 
spell.

5)I understand that Diablo wasn't created to focus on Quests, but I 
think it has extraordinary potential for some great ones. In the 
Magic Rock quest, all you had to do was find the rock on level 5. In 
Gharbad the Weak, all you did was go see him four different 
times(which was a pain). More complicated NPCs would be a start to 
more involved quests.

6)As far as NPCs go, the ones in town are great, but I'd like to see 
some in the dungeon. I'd especially like to see some NPCs that would 
join you. If you create a golem to follow you around and attack 
monsters, why not ask a monster that Diablo doesn't pay well enough. 
I think some summoning and binding spells are definitely in order.

Thanks for considering</pre>
