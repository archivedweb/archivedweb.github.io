&#62; If a sequel to Diablo is going to be made I have a few suggestions:
&#62; 
&#62; 1)Enable a primary/secondary weapon hotkey. I think a hotkey that 
&#62; allows you to quickly switch between two weapons would be extremely 
&#62; useful. For instance, if you're using a sword as your primary weapon 
&#62; and you suddenly run into a group of the undead, you could hit the 
&#62; switch hotkey and switch from your sword to your mace, the secondary 
&#62; weapon. This would also be great when killing Blood Knights with your 
&#62; sword, then quickly switching to a bow to finish off the Advocates.
&#62; 
&#62; 2)I think everyone would love an invisibility spell. There are so 
&#62; many possibilities to work with there. You could limit it however you 
&#62; want: have it use two points of mana for every second you're 
&#62; invisible, or you could have unlimited invisiblility, but become 
&#62; visible whenever you attack or cast a spell. Any way that you decide 
&#62; to make it, I'm sure players will find it useful.
&#62; 
&#62; 3)I'd like to see a version of teleport that brings up the automap 
&#62; and allows you to click on a part of the map, and that is where you 
&#62; are teleported.
&#62; 
&#62; 4)The messages in multiplayer are great, but how is it that a player 
&#62; in town can talk to players in the dungeon? I think the message 
&#62; function should only be available when you can see another player, or 
&#62; at least are within earshot. Maybe, shouting at another player might 
&#62; alert monsters nearby. I just don't think players could communicate 
&#62; with other players on different levels. Unless, they had a Telepathy 
&#62; spell.
&#62; 
&#62; 5)I understand that Diablo wasn't created to focus on Quests, but I 
&#62; think it has extraordinary potential for some great ones. In the 
&#62; Magic Rock quest, all you had to do was find the rock on level 5. In 
&#62; Gharbad the Weak, all you did was go see him four different 
&#62; times(which was a pain). More complicated NPCs would be a start to 
&#62; more involved quests.
&#62; 
&#62; 6)As far as NPCs go, the ones in town are great, but I'd like to see 
&#62; some in the dungeon. I'd especially like to see some NPCs that would 
&#62; join you. If you create a golem to follow you around and attack 
&#62; monsters, why not ask a monster that Diablo doesn't pay well enough. 
&#62; I think some summoning and binding spells are definitely in order.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for considering...

Actually, some of these suggestions aren't all that great... First of 
all, the number 1 suggestion, the weapon hotkey thing.  Exactly how 
long do you think, if you were carrying all that crap that your hero 
is carrying, do you think it would take to put your weapon away, and 
draw a whole new weapon out of your backpack?  At least 10 seconds if 
you're quick?  Blizzard was kind enough to let it take as fast as you 
are with your mouse to draw a weapon, and equip it.  The whole point 
of it is to get the realism in there.

And the invisibility spell is completely rediculous, it's too easy 
for PK's 
to PK more people.

The teleport on the map thing is a good idea, although it seems kind 
of crazy.  If your getting chased, or your chasing a person who tried 
to kill you or something, it's kinda easy to get away don't you think?

The message thing is also rediculous.  There's nothing much to say 
about it, other than, what about in Warcraft II, you think they 
screamed messages back and forth?  How bout X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, 
you think they have communication systems between the bad guys and 
the good guys.  The player to player communication is fine the way it 
is.

I'm not going to even bother with the 5th suggestion.  I guess it's 
okay.

And the 6th one is good too...


Anyways, have fun</pre>
