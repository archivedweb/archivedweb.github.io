&#62; Hello, I have just a few Suggestions for a diablo2 I haven't read all 
&#62; of the other Suggestions that any of you have made but I hope you 
&#62; like them.  
&#62; And I'll try not to make it very long.
&#62; 
&#62; For the Spells:
&#62; 
&#62; I think it would be a good Idea to have a spell that makes you Imunne
&#62; to Close range hits ( Like when a steel lord Hits you at a close 
&#62; range) but not Imunne 
&#62; to people. It would only last for a few seconds and take out Half 
&#62; your mana and Half your Life. 
&#62; 
&#62; Another One would be a Spell that Teleports the other Person.
&#62; For example if One of your friends get surrounded by a bunch of Steal 
&#62; lords You can then teleport that Person out.  But that one might have 
&#62; a few 
&#62; draw backs
&#62; 
&#62; As for the Characters 
&#62; I think There fine the way they are, but it would be a good idea to 
&#62; change the Armor. if you where going to add a character it would be a 
&#62; good idea  ( to me ) to have a SheWitch  but then thats what the 
&#62; sorcerer is for.
&#62; 
&#62; Thats All the Ideas I have for now.
&#62; Thank you for reading, +Tusheya+
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. I also think there should be more towns and levels.
&#62; 
I think another town idea would be great. It would definitely widen 
the spectrum of things. Also I would like there to be more character 
classes. As I have said before people on B.net would love this idea.</pre>
