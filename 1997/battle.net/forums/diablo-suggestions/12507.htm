<pre>&#62; I would suggest that character &#34;conditions&#34; be implemented.  
...
&#62; wizard to recharge mana, or &#34;stealth&#34; for rogue.  Of these 
&#62; conditions, perhaps the &#34;stealth&#34; condition may be the most 
&#62; interesting.
&#62; 
&#62; One major flaw in D1 was a fundamental inability to sneak up on your 
&#62; foes.  This meant that whenever you entered a room, the beasties 
&#62; gathered therein would storm you until one or the other lay dead on 
&#62; the floor.  A &#34;stealth&#34; condition would allow a character to 
&#62; sneak into a room without rousing the inhabitants, then attack just 
&#62; one monster, disposing of them before the others really know what's 
&#62; going on.  If the character can then make an escape and re-enter 
&#62; &#34;stealth&#34; mode, the monsters might stop tracking them, too!
&#62; 
&#62; As I envision the &#34;stealth&#34; mode, it would not be 
&#62; invisibility, just limit the monsters' awareness of the character.  
&#62; On the 'Net, a band of thieves could finally be effective in wiping 
&#62; out rooms of baddies, but they would not be taking out other players 
&#62; through an unfair advantage.

the effects of stealth (if successful) should be a reduction in light 
signature and sound signature.  The penalties for operating in 
stealth should be that you don't benefit from a light radius.  Also 
any noises (spellcasting, combat) would temporarily break stealth, 
the character would still be in stealth mode, but monsters should 
realize something's up.  Also characters sneaking around would have 
to travel more slowly.
I believe all characters could benefit from having 'stealth' as an 
option, the effectiveness (probably measured in noise reduction) 
might be related to an attribute (DEX for example) thus determining 
who is most effective at sneaking around.
Stealth should be differentiated from normal walking.  Normal walking 
would be faster and better lit, stomping boldly through a dungeon.  
Stealthed characters would creep slowly in the dark, relying solely 
on nightvision to find targets and a path.

Related to the stealth topic, perhaps it would help everyone to have 
a viewing area double the light radius.  As it is, monsters can 
detect and attack from beyond player view.  That or rotate the belt 
bars to the side so the view is more square/symmetric (just a thought)
