&#62; bonus instead of screwing around with changing weapons for a 
&#62; particular purpose (e.g. when you're weaker, switch to a mace to take 
&#62; out the skeletons).  When I first started playing, and the best 
&#62; sheild I  had was the buckler, I wanted to make use of two swords, 
&#62; but the game wouldnt let me.  Also, something else, after you reach a 
&#62; certain point with stregth, you should be able to use two-handed 
&#62; weapons,one handed.  Not things like bows, but axes and two-handed 
&#62; swords, maybe with a to-hit penalty.  That's just a few of my cents.

First of all using two different weapons at a time would greatly 
unbalance each of the classes. Also using two weapons at the same is 
very difficult. Try and see. 
As far as being strong enough to use two two handed swords at the 
same time or one handed the main reason you can only use those 
weapons with one hand is because of the size and weight is very 
unbalancing and you need a great deal of leverage when using them 
(that is why they have such long hilts). Even if you were strong 
enough to lift one one handed easily you could not effectivly wield 
it because one hand would not give you enough leverage. Try using 
anything large that you normally use with two hands and see how it 
works with just one.
I do think that some of the smaller axes should be allowed to be used 
with one hand because I do not see the reasoning behind making it 
only two handed when they are small. 
This is another suggestion that can be left out of Diablo because it 
serves no useful purpose except to make to game easier and thus 
reducing the challenge of the game and reducing its enjoyment for 
most of us.</pre>
