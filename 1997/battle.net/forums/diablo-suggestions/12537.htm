<pre>The thing i didnt like about Diablo is that once you finish the game, 
you dont have nothing else to do except going throught the dungeons 
again and again. What we need here is something that players must 
search stuffs and then get rewarded. Not like a Quest but something 
harder to find. So here are suggestion for a secret in Diablo II:

-There should be in the game 8 jewels of different colors that would  
be very hard to find.
 There could only be 1 by game and it would be very well hidden 
 (and i do mean very well). Sometimes you will obtain two of the same 
 color so you can exchange with a friend for something else.
 Once you get all 8 in your possession, you must go somewhere special
 and maybe an angel would appear and grant you one wish.

 The wishes could be like:
-Obtain the most powerful sword, plate, helmet,etc... 
 (Only one of them per wish)
-Get 5 or 10 free levels to help you.
-Have a lot of money (For this the game should have more than one 
kind  of money and make it harder to obtain it)
-etc,etc...

Some people will say that it would be too easy to gain powerful things
but the jewels should be scattered very very well. And they never 
appear twice at the same spot.

I hope this idea may help you guys at Blizzard to make some hard to 
find secrets in this new game.  </pre>
