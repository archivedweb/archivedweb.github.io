<pre>        Are there any guilds out there that are created just so a 
group of people can play Diablo without worrying about cheaters? 
That's it. That's all you need in a guild.
        So, why do we have these guilds with rank? People in 
cyberspace who think they're 'really cool' because they started a 
guild with a name they thought sounded really good, and then they 
named themselves something that they thought would give them instant 
appraisal, and admiration. People that sound like this:&#34;I'm the 
High Lord of the Devil Slayers!&#34; or something stupid like that. 
         And then, these guilds have there little divisions. It 
sounds like this:

BadAssMan(High Lord of the Devil Slayers): &#34;Deathlord, for your 
outstanding courage in the face of Hell's demons, I appoint you First 
Mark of the Angels of Destruction, our special attack team!&#34;

Deathlord(newly appointed whatever he is):&#34;Oh, thank you, my 
lord! I shall lead you and your troops to victory against the vile 
demons and the wicked cheaters!&#34;

         And then they have these gay rules about 'whenever someone 
of a higher rank is in a game with you, you must follow their direct 
orders', and shit like that. Let me tell you something you might have 
miss(just like you missed out on social adeptitude): THESE CYBER-
RANKS ARE NOT REAL. I have held ranks in real life, it takes hard 
work, and dedication. You don't get respect by tacking a name and a 
title onto yourself in real life, and it especially doesn't work in 
cyber-space.
         So, please, could somebody start a guild where you sign up, 
are given a password, and allowed to play with non-cheating 
characters. A guild where the only rules are: no cheating.
          Also, I am not a Pkiller, but it's part of the game. Nobody 
likes to get kill, but it's so much fun to have to watch your back. 
Here's a suggestion. Instead of going into a game, and gaining 
someone's trust before stabbing them in the back, why not do this: 
        Enter a game with Pkilling in mind. Send a message to the 
person you want to kill saying, &#34;If I find you, I'm going to kill 
you&#34;. Now, a lot of people will just run away and leave the game, 
but there are some people, like me, who will take on the challenge. 
Anticipation of death is always worse than death itself, so this 
should be more satisfying. What could be more satisfying than hunting 
someone down who knows he's going to die? </pre>
