&#62; &#62; If a sequel to Diablo is going to be made I have a few suggestions:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1)Enable a primary/secondary weapon hotkey. I think a hotkey that 
&#62; &#62; allows you to quickly switch between two weapons would be extremely 
&#62; &#62; useful. For instance, if you're using a sword as your primary weapon 
&#62; &#62; and you suddenly run into a group of the undead, you could hit the 
&#62; &#62; switch hotkey and switch from your sword to your mace, the secondary 
&#62; &#62; weapon. This would also be great when killing Blood Knights with your 
&#62; &#62; sword, then quickly switching to a bow to finish off the Advocates.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2)I think everyone would love an invisibility spell. There are so 
&#62; &#62; many possibilities to work with there. You could limit it however you 
&#62; &#62; want: have it use two points of mana for every second you're 
&#62; &#62; invisible, or you could have unlimited invisiblility, but become 
&#62; &#62; visible whenever you attack or cast a spell. Any way that you decide 
&#62; &#62; to make it, I'm sure players will find it useful.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3)I'd like to see a version of teleport that brings up the automap 
&#62; &#62; and allows you to click on a part of the map, and that is where you 
&#62; &#62; are teleported.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 4)The messages in multiplayer are great, but how is it that a player 
&#62; &#62; in town can talk to players in the dungeon? I think the message 
&#62; &#62; function should only be available when you can see another player, or 
&#62; &#62; at least are within earshot. Maybe, shouting at another player might 
&#62; &#62; alert monsters nearby. I just don't think players could communicate 
&#62; &#62; with other players on different levels. Unless, they had a Telepathy 
&#62; &#62; spell.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 5)I understand that Diablo wasn't created to focus on Quests, but I 
&#62; &#62; think it has extraordinary potential for some great ones. In the 
&#62; &#62; Magic Rock quest, all you had to do was find the rock on level 5. In 
&#62; &#62; Gharbad the Weak, all you did was go see him four different 
&#62; &#62; times(which was a pain). More complicated NPCs would be a start to 
&#62; &#62; more involved quests.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 6)As far as NPCs go, the ones in town are great, but I'd like to see 
&#62; &#62; some in the dungeon. I'd especially like to see some NPCs that would 
&#62; &#62; join you. If you create a golem to follow you around and attack 
&#62; &#62; monsters, why not ask a monster that Diablo doesn't pay well enough. 
&#62; &#62; I think some summoning and binding spells are definitely in order.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks for considering
&#62; 
&#62;     They are very good ideas. I dont like one thing though you cant 
&#62; commnicate unless u are very close. Nice idea but it would make 
&#62; Diablos way 2 hard.
&#62; I have a suggestion also. On single player games some of the 
&#62; characters in the town should come down and help you everyonce  in a 
&#62; while. Example the blacksmith could fight very good. Suggestion 
&#62; number 6 is ok but a monster would not help a human. Remember the sin 
&#62; wars in Diablo all monsters in Diablos wont to destroy humans. The 
&#62; only monsters in Diablo thats may help you would be the Steels 
&#62; Kinghts or Doom Guards.  


These are some good suggestions, folks.  The ability to change your 
weapon quickly is a good idea, but, with some practice, you should be 
able to change weapons quickly enough within your inventory screen.

Keep your secondary weapon in a handy position on your inventory.  
Then, when you need to change, hit 'i', click on the weapon in your 
inventory, click on your hand to equip it.  Then, if you need to save 
time, drop the item you were using previously (it should be on your 
cursor now), hit I again, and swing away!  It does take some work, 
but it also represents the time it would take a ready a new weapon.  
If you're good, though, it should only take a second :)

Again, thanks for the suggestions,
Pat N.</pre>
