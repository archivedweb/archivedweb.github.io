Rob,

Have you tried playing in a private game?  A private game works in 
almost every way just like a public game, with the following 
exceptions:

-There is no list of private games to join when you click on the Join 
screen.  All the games shown on this screen are public games.

-To enter a private game, you must know both the name and password 
for the game (if you create the game, then you decide on the name and 
password.

-Private games usually have to be planned in chat channels before 
they are create (this allows for the name and password for the 
private game to be decided), while one can enter a public game with 
no such planning.

The next time you're on battle.net, talk to some other players about 
joining a private game.  After a few mintues of conversations, you 
should be able to tell if the other player(s) are trustworthy.  

After you have decided on a game name and password with one or more 
players, decide who will create the game.  The creator should then 
click on the Create button, type in the name and password of the game 
in the appropriate areas, then click OK.  The game will then be 
created, and the creator can begin playing.

Those that are planning on joining this game should click on the Join 
button, type in the discussed name and password in the appropriate 
areas, then click on Ok.  They will then join the created game and 
can play.

You should make a list of the players you have met on battle.net that 
are trustworthy, and look for them the next time you are on (these 
people are good candidates for private game partners).  Use the /who 
command on players in the battle.net chat channels, and write down 
their account numbers.  You can then use the /who command on these 
people in the future to see if they are connected to battle.net.

examples of the /who command:

/who patn  --syntax for using the /who command on a character's name
/who #34245 -- suntax for using the /who command on a characters's 
account number.

If you have further questions, fee free to post on the Technical 
support forum, or to send email to support@blizzard.com.

Thanks,
Pat N.</pre>
