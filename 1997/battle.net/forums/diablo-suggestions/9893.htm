&#62; game design / gameplay suggestions
&#62; 
&#62; 1) The rectangular screen sometimes makes it difficult when you are 
&#62; moving up. You can barely see what you are walking into sometimes. 
&#62; Perhaps a round playing area might work better. The controls and 
&#62; buttons would be to the sides since most monitors are rectangular and 
&#62; the circular playing area would take up the whole height of the 
&#62; screen and an equal distance in the middle length of the screen. At 
&#62; any rate, there should be a little more distance between the 
&#62; character and the top edge.
&#62; 
&#62; 2) Probably, already heard it, but the town must go. Or at least get 
&#62; much more compact. Or become a bigger part of playing the game. 
&#62; Personally, I prefer the first of the 3 options. This leads me to an 
&#62; idea for battlenet. When you log on the first screen you see is an 
&#62; overhead view of a large town or city. As you move your mouse over 
&#62; the city it highlights the roofs of various buildings and tells you 
&#62; what they are (no need to have a character moving around in the city 
&#62; though.) There would be a lot of pubs (representing the public chat 
&#62; channels), private clubs for the private chats (the city might have a 
&#62; section outside its walls which could accomadate a changing number of 
&#62; buildings), several shops - a weaponsmith, bowyer, armorer, and 
&#62; apothecary that sell the basic potions and all the normal, nonmagical 
&#62; weapons and armor (but no magical items), and of couse a public 
&#62; trading square (which perhaps would allow for a fair exchange of gold 
&#62; and items.) I think this would give the game a much better atmosphere 
&#62; than the sci-fi like screens bnet presently has and it would take 
&#62; care of some of the basic non-adventure functions without devoting a 
&#62; lot of space or time to it. The city would also have to appear when 
&#62; people start non-bnet games, but the pubs or trading post just 
&#62; wouldn't highlighted. (btw I'm not wild about banks in crpgs and if 
&#62; you don't go with a server based game again it won't matter anyways, 
&#62; but a jewelry shop that sold very expensive gems, rings, or amulets 
&#62; might be another way to allow players to work at amassing and 
&#62; carrying a little more wealth.)
&#62; 
&#62; 3) The four hotkeys worked well for Diablo, but a sequel will 
&#62; probably add more spells (and hopefully skills) and would require 
&#62; more. However, its already kind of akward going from the hotkeys to 
&#62; the belt keys - anything more than 4 keys right next to each other I 
&#62; find aggravating. As an alternative to making 8 or more spell/skill 
&#62; hotkeys how about keys to scroll through your options. Both mouse 
&#62; buttons would have a little window like there is now for the spell to 
&#62; be cast when you right click. The basic move/hack function would be 
&#62; the default on the left button, but since you have to stop to do 
&#62; anything anyways you could still get to some spells/skills from this 
&#62; one as well. This should make a lot of options available quickly 
&#62; without having to fumble around the keyboard (yes, I never got past 
&#62; the training exercise in X- Wing.) Another key could bring up two 
&#62; versions of your spells and skills in two wheels that represent what 
&#62; order they rotate in for each mouse button. You could click and drag 
&#62; them around to your own specifications. Probably, an overcomplicated 
&#62; explanation, but I think this would be much simplier to play than 
&#62; having to use more than 4 keys all around the keyboard (even potions 
&#62; and scrolls could be used this way.)

Great Idea's... I think number 2 and 3 are my favorite's (manly 2).
