&#62; Well, I have to agree that most of these ideas are pretty good. With 
&#62; some exceptions:
&#62; An invisibility spell would make the game too easy for the pk's. Just 
&#62; imagine them sneaking up on you without you even noticing it. It's 
&#62; bad enough with the ghosts but if the pk's can sneek up to you 
&#62; without cheating......well, maybe if the spell didn't last very long 
&#62; and only existed on staffs and scrolls

First of all, the whole point of an invisibility spell is to sneak up 
on people, so don't whine
&#62; 
&#62; I also agree that only be able to send messages to the guys you can 
&#62; see would make the game too hard.

Again whining about the game being too hard. I think this would make 
it more challenging and more cooperative.
&#62; 
&#62; If this is a sequel as in Diablo 2 we're talking about I think that 
&#62; more changes would be needed. Like:
&#62; 
&#62; 1. New and cool monsters, weapons, spells and characters

If you're going to post suggestions, at least elaborate on them. Of 
course a sequel would have new monsters, weapons, spells and 
characters. Why don't you give us an idea of what KIND of monsters, 
weapons, spells, and characters you'd like to see.

&#62; 2. A new town. I meen that the forces of darkness have fucked enough 
&#62; with Tristram.

Again with the vague suggestion. Oh boy, a new town. Why don't they 
just have different names for the towns and have them all look the 
same. Give us an idea of what you would like to see in a new town.

Oh yeah, I forgot. You're tough because you said fuck.

&#62; 3. A totally new story. Diablo can't rise again that would be like in 
&#62; some lousy B-movie (Jason's back again, and again, and 
&#62; again....)Maybe one of the other Prime-Evils could start to mess with 
&#62; the world.

Do you really think Blizzard is that lame that they would just bring 
back Diablo when they have so many other paths to take with the story?

&#62; 4. Blizzard have to make it harder to cheat.

How about impossible to cheat?

&#62; 5. Make the game bigger, with a big fast access map that can take you 
&#62; outside the town, like to the forest or something. I, for one, think 
&#62; it's kind of silly that everything is in the little village of 
&#62; Tristram.
 
You sound like Beavis.&#34;Let's have a new town...and a forest! Or 
something.&#34; 
&#62; 
&#62; Well I guess that's it

Didn't you mean FAT_Butcher?</pre>
