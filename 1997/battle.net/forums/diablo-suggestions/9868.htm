&#62; Although I do not like PKs I think that it is a valid part of the

&#62; 
&#62; I suggest that when a player is struck by a &#34;friendly or 
&#62; unfriendly&#34; player that they are immediately switched to player 
&#62; attack mode.  This would prevent someone getting in 10 whacks while 
&#62; the defender tries to switch modes.
&#62; 
   Ofcourse if you were automatically switched to attacked mode and 
then killed, you would lose all your stuff instead of an ear and half 
your gold.  This could be bad going up against a player with cheats.  
Also, some people do not like pks (I don't care as long as they don't 
cheat) and this switch would really give them cause not to play for 
fear of losing everything they had.

&#62; &#34;Friendly Fire&#34; is good.  If it were removed I feel the game 
&#62; would suffer.  An archer or mage should be required to think and plan 
&#62; before loosing hell amongst his friends.
