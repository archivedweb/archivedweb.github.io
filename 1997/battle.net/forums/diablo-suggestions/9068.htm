&#62; If a sequel to Diablo is going to be made I have a few suggestions:
&#62; 
&#62; 1)Enable a primary/secondary weapon hotkey. I think a hotkey that 
&#62; allows you to quickly switch between two weapons would be extremely 
&#62; useful. For instance, if you're using a sword as your primary weapon 
&#62; and you suddenly run into a group of the undead, you could hit the 
&#62; switch hotkey and switch from your sword to your mace, the secondary 
&#62; weapon. This would also be great when killing Blood Knights with your 
&#62; sword, then quickly switching to a bow to finish off the Advocates.
&#62; 
&#62; 2)I think everyone would love an invisibility spell. There are so 
&#62; many possibilities to work with there. You could limit it however you 
&#62; want: have it use two points of mana for every second you're 
&#62; invisible, or you could have unlimited invisiblility, but become 
&#62; visible whenever you attack or cast a spell. Any way that you decide 
&#62; to make it, I'm sure players will find it useful.
&#62; 
&#62; 3)I'd like to see a version of teleport that brings up the automap 
&#62; and allows you to click on a part of the map, and that is where you 
&#62; are teleported.
&#62; 
&#62; 4)The messages in multiplayer are great, but how is it that a player 
&#62; in town can talk to players in the dungeon? I think the message 
&#62; function should only be available when you can see another player, or 
&#62; at least are within earshot. Maybe, shouting at another player might 
&#62; alert monsters nearby. I just don't think players could communicate 
&#62; with other players on different levels. Unless, they had a Telepathy 
&#62; spell.
&#62; 
&#62; 5)I understand that Diablo wasn't created to focus on Quests, but I 
&#62; think it has extraordinary potential for some great ones. In the 
&#62; Magic Rock quest, all you had to do was find the rock on level 5. In 
&#62; Gharbad the Weak, all you did was go see him four different 
&#62; times(which was a pain). More complicated NPCs would be a start to 
&#62; more involved quests.
&#62; 
&#62; 6)As far as NPCs go, the ones in town are great, but I'd like to see 
&#62; some in the dungeon. I'd especially like to see some NPCs that would 
&#62; join you. If you create a golem to follow you around and attack 
&#62; monsters, why not ask a monster that Diablo doesn't pay well enough. 
&#62; I think some summoning and binding spells are definitely in order.
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks for considering


Here's some of my humble ideas

1.) New shops, like a magic shop that can enchance your weapons and 
armour

2.) Allow use of two weapons, like a sword in one hand and an axe in 
another.

3.) More weapon types, like darts, stones etc...

4.) More weapon variables, like a bow that does A LOT of damage but 
takes a LONG time to reload.

5.) More enchancers, like stuffs not only limited to increasing 
attacking speed and recovering speed but also walking speed.

6.) More armour type, like gloves and boots

7.) More character type, (that's what everyone complaining about)

8.) More conditions, like your character being poisoned, on fire etc

9.) More cooler emenies, like Elementals (Stone man, Ice man, Fire 
man)

10.) More player per game

11.) More towns, e.g. allow player to step through a portal to go to 
another town/game</pre>
