<blockquote>
<pre>but I was impressed enough by your product to want to add my $0.02:

MORE CHARACTER FREEDOM:  Characters should be allowed to do whatever 
they want.   i.e.  If you want to kill Peppin, go ahead...  Sure, 
you'll get a couple of potions, but then you'll be without an 
important source of healing.  And maybe the other town members will 
shun you from then on...  The addition of choices and consequences 
would add depth to the game.  In a similar vein, it should be 
possible to fail quests.  For example, if you want to drink the 
golden elixir rather than giving it to Lachdanan, that should be your 
choice, as should killing the friendly NPC's.  However, you may miss 
out on some choice items;  maybe you'll choose differently the next 
time you play... 

CHEATING:  Unless you can ensure that no one will be able to cheat (a 
difficult task indeed!), you should take the wind out of their sails 
and build it into the game.  LET them cheat if they want to...  
However, Battle.Net should recognize the cheaters and sequester them 
from legitimate characters.  Besides isolating those characters for 
which the provided cheat menu has been used, a criteria of 
inappropriate statistics or improbable combinations of magic items 
could be used to judge someone a cheater.  A history for each 
character could also be kept rather easily:  every moster they killed 
etc...  Encrypted, such a history might be difficult to forge and 
from it one could easily verify if this character has the appropriate 
amount of experience, etc...

LESS LINEAR:  I would like to see larger levels.  Ideally they would 
be large enough that players would not feel compelled to explore the 
whole level.  I wouldn't have a problem with it if the game had to 
stop and load more of a level after you passed through a certain 
door, etc... If the levels weren't all square-shaped, that would be a 
bonus.   There should be multiple stairs down, some leading to dead-
end levels, others providing multiple paths to the same objective.

BETTER GRAPHICS:  The graphics are good.  However, by the time Diablo 
II comes out, I imagine there'll be a swarm of imitators...  Adopt 
The Motion Factory's graphics engine (at www.motion-factory.com).  It 
may be $25,000, but it's worth it...

MORE COMPLEX QUESTS:  Quests are a good idea, but they should be more 
than &#34;kill these monsters and bring this item to whomever...&#34; 
 Particularly interesting might be timed quests...  i.e. if you don't 
clear out a pocket of evil near the town quickly enough, the monsters 
invade the town and start to kill the inhabitants...  If you don't 
clear the water supply, inhabitants start leaving...

MORE INTERACTIVITY:  An excellent way to extend the character 
interface would be:  Whatever you're holding, if you can use it 
on/with what it is touching on the screen, that object lights up.  
i.e.  hmmm, maybe that old coin you found a couple of levels ago 
would do something in this fountain.  You pull it out of your 
inventory, move it over the fountain, and voila!  the fountain lights 
up...

MORE D&D:  Although I'm sure your lawyers would vehemently deny it, 
you've borrowed a lot from D&D (and other RPG's)  Borrow more:  How 
about rooms where the doors close and they start to fill with water?  
 Hmmm, I can swim across this river if I leave all my stuff 
behind...;    Ahh, Adria warned me not to touch any of the treasure 
in this room....

HAVE MONSTERS DISPERSE FROM THE VICINITY OF STAIRS:  Dying before you 
can even cast one spell is annoying...

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GO TO TOWN:  Maybe if you cast a town-
portal, the nearest one appears.  However, it may be on a level above 
or below you....  It would be fun if characters had to work and 
extend themselves to get back to town sometimes rather than 
recharging on a whim.  

WANDERING MONSTERS:  Some of the monsters should wander rather than 
wait for the characters.

ENCOURAGE ROLE-PLAYING:  When each new character is made, a one-page 
history of that character should be provided including 
characteristics such as honesty, greed, bravery, intelligence, etc... 
 There's no need to ENFORCE role-playing in the game; just supplying 
this little nudge/hint would probably encourage many players to add 
this dimension to their gaming experience.

finally,
MORE USEFUL NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS:  While it was amusing, the vast 
majority of what the characters in town had to say was useless.  They 
should offer more information.  Maybe you could come across a fellow 
adventurer who would drop a few hints for the right price...
