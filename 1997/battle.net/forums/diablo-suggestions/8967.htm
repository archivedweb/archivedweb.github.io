<pre>Oops My mistake. I posted it on the strategy....

Here it is:

   Ok this has nothing to do with sex and porno and stuff I just 
wanted to make you people read this. Regarding talking inside the 
game it really doesn't sound realistic that players can speak with 
each other from different levels as if they had TELEPATHY. Now that's 
an Idea for the next RPG you people are going to make.

   Telepathy and Communication. Telepathy could either be a talent or 
a spell that a person can know. Talking to people inside the game 
should be limited to the proximity the speaker has with the other 
person. If they wanted to know where the player is the player could 
acknowledge his presence by TELEPATHY or by a SIREN from a horn or 
something. This would make for a more strategic game.

   Talents. Talents are missing from the game only a single talent 
AKA skill are present per character class. The ability to gain talent 
would be nice.  talents should be learned from NPC's (non player 
characters) or from other players who already know talents but they 
should meet the requirements for a particular talent.

   Character Classes, Abilities, and Attributes. The Attributes: 
Strength, Magic, Agility, and Endurance are very limited and has a 
broad scope. It would be nice if you could add some more character 
attributes so this would have a better feel and realism. Addictive as 
Diablo is, it is still lacking in the RPG area.</pre>
