&#62; &#62; U are playing in a third person perspective, not a doom first person 
&#62; &#62; perspective!!! If u didn't know,light radius are &#34;made&#34; to 
&#62; &#62; allow AI to see u , thus activating monsters nearby. Your suggestion 
&#62; &#62; will lead to easy retreatment without any monsters following 
&#62; &#62; behind(coz they can't &#34;see&#34; u). And monsters infront will see 
&#62; &#62; u miles ahead before u can see them.
&#62; 
&#62; I'm afraid I disagree with you here, there could be a work around
&#62; with this dilemma you may be having regarding light radius. Why not
&#62; separate EXTENT OF VISION from VISIBILITY so as to remove your
&#62; current &#34;disagreement.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; With the separation I mean that the ability of the AI to see you
&#62; would be wholly different from your ability to see them. That would
&#62; mean they can see you even though your back was turned on them.
&#62; It would all depend on how far their EXTENT OF VISION is set.

So u mean blizzard have to program each and every single monster's 
visibilty?? Man that's hard work(couldn't imagine me doing me, 
yikes)!! Then comes a question again, different monsters with EXTENT 
OF VISION(why caps?) will see u differently, so woudn't that lead to 
activating monsters(with far vision) up front first rather than 
activating the nearer monsters*which have short vision). Doesn't 
sound logical to me. (if u dun understand what i mean, i can't help 
u, but then again, probably no one can ). In diablo, monsters don't 
have their own &#34;vision&#34;, they simply get activated by ur 
light radius, thus that's why u sometimes see players that equips -
light radius stuff, so that they can walk right up to a monster 
without activating the ones nearby.(stupid but effective AI).
&#62; 
&#62; Then regarding the other thing visibility key. Something lacking
&#62; in Diablo is the ability to surprise monsters or to sneak up on
&#62; them. Yes that would be possible if the ANGLE OF VISIBILITY is
&#62; considered. For example if a monster was facing towards the north
&#62; but you luckily approach him from the south the AI shouldn't be able
&#62; to see you coming because of their Limited angle of visibility.
&#62; That would enable players to backstab monsters and other players
&#62; since the players also have a limited angle of visibility.
&#62; 
&#62; Hey replying is fun!

Surprise monsters?? Why do u want to surprise computer sprites with 
no feelings and emotions?? Backstabbing are for human players. 
Monsters don't go &#34;oh shit!!&#34; like we do =)
If diablo is a frist person perspective game, i will agree with ur 
angle of visiblity suggestion, but it's not. it's a game with a 
isometric view where u see what on ur screen, blah blah...u get the 
point.
