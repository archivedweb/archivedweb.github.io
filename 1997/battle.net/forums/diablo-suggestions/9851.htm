&#62; Alot of what you have described is in development in a new game.
&#62; It is being written by Origin Software.  &#34;Ultima Online&#34;  It 
&#62; looks like it will really be the next multiplayer &#34;Hit&#34; game 
&#62; of the web.  Check it out..   &#60;a

&#62; &#62; I would just like to share some ideas i have on diablo 2.  First of 
&#62; &#62; all I think it would be great to have horses in the game!  I think 
&#62; &#62; there should be a ranch or something where you buy the horse and also 
&#62; &#62; you can equip it with armor (the horse should be able to die.)  Make 
&#62; &#62; the horse be able to carry things on it.
&#62; &#62; Second, I think a new level like a swamp where you go knee deep in 
&#62; &#62; nasty water killing enemies popping up left and right.  
&#62; &#62; Third, when you join a game i think instead of having a loading 
&#62; &#62; screen when you go down to the first lvl of hell or the cats etc. it 
&#62; &#62; should be more like a role playing game with fast loading but in 
&#62; &#62; order to do this i would make it to where it loads in the first of 
&#62; &#62; every lvl in the game.  
&#62; &#62; Fourth,  Bows and arrows should be like the mage's staff's, they 
&#62; &#62; should have to refill the arrows at some kind of elf or something and 
&#62; &#62; be able to upgrade weapons to a certain extent.  
&#62; &#62; Also i don't know how you could do this in multiplayer but it would 
&#62; &#62; be cool if for a quest you have to protect the town from monsters 
&#62; &#62; killing people off.
&#62; &#62; Fifth, deffinitely if possible expand the number of character's aloud 
&#62; &#62; in one game (I know the lag's bad already but it would be very cool 
&#62; &#62; to have about 6 in one game than 4.)
&#62; &#62; And last, you should be able to go into the tavern and get a drink, 
&#62; &#62; go inside griswold's place and actually watch him repair you sword or 
&#62; &#62; whatever it is.  Also the water around the town make that flowing 
&#62; &#62; (but i would put an option of some sort to let you disable the 
&#62; &#62; flowing water.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Sincerely,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Scott Smith
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Battle.net character's are:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Cloud (warrior lvl 36)
&#62; &#62; ZeroDivide (mage lvl 31) 
&#62; &#62; Link (warrior lvl 30 and current character right now)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; P.S.  Please diablo fans and maker's of diablo don't get me wrong 
&#62; &#62; diablo is my favorite game of all time just i'd like people to 
&#62; &#62; consider these ideas of mine thanx :)
&#62; &#62; 

PLEASE THE GUY THAT REPLIED TO MY MESSAGE EMAIL ME ABOUT THIS GAME I 
MUST HAVE IT!!!  I went to the site and took a look at some screen

message i would like to know more about the game!

Thanx,
