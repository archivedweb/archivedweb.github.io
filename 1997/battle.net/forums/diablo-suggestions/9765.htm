&#62; Here's a quick one. (Kind of...) You may have to work out some stuff, 
&#62; because the info I'm going to type is copyrighted by TSR, Inc., but if
&#62; you did Diablo 2 like this, it would kick some MAJOR butt.
&#62; 
&#62; OK, now keep in mind, I'm only making a suggestion for characters 
&#62; right now. Now, here's the tip:
&#62; 
&#62; Make charcter creation/play like Dungeons & Dragons!!!!!
&#62; For example:
&#62; 
&#62; Character Stats go like this:
&#62; 
&#62; Strength - Physical power
&#62; Dexterity - Nimbleness, agility
&#62; Constitution - Durability, health
&#62; Intelligence - Knowledge, overall smartness
&#62; Wisdom - Common sense, perception
&#62; Charisma - Good looks, personality
&#62; 
&#62; Character classes: 
&#62; 
&#62; Fighter - Basic warrior. No magic skills, but gains magic resistance 
&#62; per 
&#62;               level. (ie 5&#37; at first, 10&#37; at 2nd.)
&#62; Paladin - Holy warrior. Starts of like a Fighter, but gains healing 
&#62; spells
&#62;                and special abilities vs. Undead.
&#62; Ranger - A Fighter the specializes in a type of terrain (ie. Forest,  
&#62;              Caves, etc.), and lives in peace with nature, defending 
&#62; his
&#62;               &#34;area&#34;. Gains healing spells later on, and has 
&#62; a special
&#62;               empathy with animals.
&#62; Cleric - Basically, a healer, but with fighting abilities as well. 
&#62; Druid - A mix between Ranger and Cleric. Lives in peace and harmony
&#62;            with nature, not as much of a fighter, but more of a 
&#62; healer.
&#62; Thief - Sneaks around, steals, assassinates, spies, etc.
&#62; Bard - Jack of all trades, Master of none. Weak fighter, closer to 
&#62; Thief
&#62;           level, weak Theif abilities, can cast some magic later on.
&#62; Wizard - Cast spells, weak fighter.
&#62; 
&#62; Then of course, there's stuff like Fighter/Wizard, or Fighter/Cleric, 
&#62; etc.
&#62; And, classes use different stats: 
&#62; 
&#62; Fighter - Strength; Paladin - Strength, Wisdom, Charisma;
&#62; Ranger - Strength, Wisdom, Dexterity; Cleric - Wisdom;
&#62; Druid - Wisdom, Inteliigence; Wizard - Intelligence; Thief - 
&#62; Dexterity;
&#62; Bard - Dexteritry, Charisma, Intelligence.
&#62; 
&#62; As far as the characters themselves,  you've got races.
&#62; 
&#62; Human - Standard person.
&#62; Elf - Infravision, +1 Intelligence, - Constitution
&#62; Dwarf - Infravision, +1 Strength, +1 Constitution, -1 Intelligence
&#62; Half-Elf - Infravision
&#62; 
&#62; There are more races, but that's the basic ones. 
&#62; 
&#62; So... What do ya'll think? Let me know.
&#62; 
&#62; Logain
 



i like the idea of different races so all characters wouldnt look the 
same but the game wouldnt be as fun without a warrior with spells and 
wizards with swords etc.
