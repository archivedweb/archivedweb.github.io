&#62; I have a question for all you Diablo experts out there concerning
&#62; the delegation of experience in multi-player games.
&#62; 
&#62; When multiple people are attacking monsters, how is experience
&#62; allocated?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I've been trying to figure this out.  It seemed to me at first that
&#62; if 2 players were on the same screen as a monster and the monster
&#62; died, then both gained EXP...however after some experimenting only
&#62; sometimes did that occur...
&#62; 
&#62; So I have a new theory that seems to hold, and that is:
&#62; 
&#62;   You gain experience from a monsters death if you have somehow
&#62; contributed to damaging that creature...so if you hit it for 1 damage,
&#62; you get experience when it dies. No matter if you kill it or not.
&#62; 
&#62;   Is this correct?

While I do not know the exact method of how exp is divided, I do know 
for a FACT that this is the case. Pat over in Tech Support as said a 
few times that if two players attack a creature, all those who caused 
damage to the creature get exp. The exact amount you get.... I have 
no idea.


 
&#62;   Also, if that is to a point correct, what about spells like golem
&#62; and guardian or stone curse?  Golem and guardian are sort of indirect
&#62; ways to damage a creature so would that count toward gaining EXP from
&#62; a monsters death? And what about stone curse? If you stone something,
&#62; do you get exp when it dies? If so, then that would lead me to believe
&#62; that you gain EXP if you hit a creature with ANYTHING, rather than
&#62; actually doing damage to it...
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Xiximarizanix, Mage

You get Exp from any spell that affects the monster prior to death 
with the exception of StoneCurse. I really haven't paid attention to 
exp allotments of multiplayer kills, but I think as StoneCurse 
doesn't affect the monsters damage, you don't get exp for stoneing 
while the other person kills (I noticed something else about SC that 
I really don't want to explain that also backs this up).

I hope this helps a little.
