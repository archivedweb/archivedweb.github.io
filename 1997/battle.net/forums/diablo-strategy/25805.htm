<pre>I think that the rogue and the warrior characters are the best 
combination.  However, each player has to understand what the other 
is going to do in certain situations.

Each character should focus on their individual strengths.  I (a 
rogue) always aim for distance-fighting targets like witches that the 
warrior has a harder time with, while he can concentrate on close-
fighting targets.

Also, I always have Stone Curse hot-keyed.  When I see the warrior 
going for a moving target, I'll Stone Curse it and then aim at 
something else farther afield.  

But each of you needs be aware of the other, not just aware of the 
monsters.  You need to be aware that Sir Oppy might run into your 
line of fire at any second.  Sir Oppy, in turn, needs to remember not 
to run into your line of fire, and to zig-zag out of it if he does. 

Warriors can only hit up close, so they have a tendency to rush in 
when they should hold back a bit.    

I also play as a warrior with another warrior, and we had this 
problem because he usually played single player and was used to 
playing alone.  I still bug him about the time he stood behind me in 
a doorway, cutting off my retreat.  Then, after I died, he 
resurrected me in the same position, with the same monsters around me 
and him behind me...you can guess what happened again. :)

In our games, I would always cast a Firewall over a pack of witches.  
He kept running into the Firewall to attack the witches and got 
killed a couple of times.  He got a bit pissed off until I pointed 
out that I will *always* cast Firewall in that situation, so he 
should expect the firewall and not run into it.  



F9-12 Hotkeys could help, though you may not have time to hit them.

Just use Notepad to edit &#34;diablo.ini&#34; in your Diablo 
directory.

My hotkeys are set up to communicate my most common messages:

 F9:  Shit! Help!
F10:  I'm in town/at witch
F11:  I'm on my way...
F12:  Sorry, can't talk now!</pre>
