&#62; To all,
&#62; 
&#62;        Arrggg, I'm so frustrated!!!  I have been playing for now 4 
&#62; months (too long perhaps).  I been there and done that.  Joined Clans 
&#62; and Guilds, I got sick of their some stupid rule that was practically 
&#62; cheating or Masters that themselves are cheaters.  I have met 
&#62; reformed cheaters (now really great legit players).  Cheated once, 
&#62; not knowing (stupid newbiew I was once. Had to destroy a lvl 32 Mage, 
&#62; that was hardest).  Found treasure beyond others eyes have seen (I 
&#62; play too much, but nvr seen a strange bastard sword of Haste yet).  
&#62; Met friends, who I wish come back to Diablo again to helping each 
&#62; other out (still have a few left).  Been Pked so many times, then I 
&#62; learned to play private games.  Met people who showed me some 
&#62; skilles.  I aquired some myself.
&#62; 
&#62;       To illustrate my position, I'm posting what I have:
&#62; Bastard Swords:
&#62;       Soldiers sword of Blood
&#62;       King's sword of Haste (gave a broad version away)
&#62;       King's sword of Vampire
&#62;       King's sword of Titan
&#62;       King's sword of Gore
&#62;       King's sword of Sorcery
&#62;       Champion's sword of Haste
&#62; King's Flail of Haste
&#62; 3 StormShield
&#62; 2 Gotther (unided)
&#62; 1 Helm of Sprits
&#62; 1 Helm of Royal Circlet (gave one away)
&#62; 1 Thinking cap (gave 2 away)
&#62; 1 Naj's plate
&#62; I have AAA(12 charges) AA resurrect(10 charges) AA Fireball (56 
&#62; charges)
&#62; Tons of rings about 5 Zodiac.
&#62; 1 obs of wiz (40&#37; 27magic)
&#62; 1 obs of lion (40&#37; 55 hp)
&#62; 1 obs (40&#37;)
&#62; 1 constricting ring. and etc
&#62; 1 windforce
&#62; I have seen AAN, AAW(+30), tossed Dreamflanges, cause I like AA 
&#62; better and have strong weapon and sheild for triple immues), lots of 
&#62; apocs, and etc.
&#62; have 3 awesome plates. (1 has 19 dex added, another with max ac of 
&#62; 183)
&#62; I admit, I'm very luck, probably one of the luckiest.  It was painful 
&#62; to be legit, but I'm one and love playing Diablo they way it was 
&#62; meant to be.  Taking time to know people, find out some were cheat 
&#62; some were more hardcore legit them I'm (the purists))  I'm now going 
&#62; to a channel where legit players are at.  Some guilds come and go.  
&#62; Only 2 Guild are very strong.  
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; ****Now My Frustration*****
&#62; What the hell is wrong with legit players.  Why are they so paranoid 
&#62; that they can't accept the possibility of other people can have 
&#62; better stuff and better skill.  I personally found a zodiac in cave 
&#62; with my rogue(in her early lvl when she couldn't even go in to hell). 
&#62; Is it wrong to keep a very powerful items. People, who don't know me 
&#62; well, are starting to accused me of cheater, because I have such 
&#62; powerful and rare items and don't die in even in a situation which 
&#62; most would die due to skill (I think).  I know I shouldn't care (most 
&#62; part I don't) but since I'm not in a guild or clan, which I don't 
&#62; want to {(Many did try to recruite me, some even wanted me to be a 
&#62; hunter. hehe, I rarely duel,(once perhaps I think), I rather play 
&#62; coop anyday then to duel (I hate the sound of ear drop :p )} so I 
&#62; have to find a game to play but It's getting harder and harder as My 
&#62; lvl rises.  (I trade between my chars, but has to be equal of value). 
&#62;  What do you think?  Am I a cheater in your eyes due to my stuff?  
&#62; Should I expect the response I get?  Are most legit people too 
&#62; paranoid?  I miss the days when I can drop the king's swords on the 
&#62; ground and be safe to play with others.  I'm becoming very unhappy 
&#62; and frustrated legit player.  Please give me, some of your thoughts.  
&#62; I'm beginning to think about Retiring Diablo complete. :(

Well, you don't have to care about others that much, legit or not 
that's not important in others' eyes but it is important to yourself. 
For me, I dupe items but I think I'm legit, and I don't care what 
people think about me. Why I dupe? It's because I used to ask someone 
to stay in the game for me and I would transfer some items between my 
chars. Guess what, when I was back, the game's gone with my items. So 
I've started duping items whenever I need to transfer my items, just 
to make it safe. Also, some people think I cheat just because my new 
char got good items. What's wrong with that? They are all my items. 
Although it's duped, it's all my hard working. However, I don't use 
any cheat programs and god mode.

So just take it easy and play the game in the way it's supposed to 
be. After all it's just a game and you've got your life to live. 
Enjoy the game the way you think it's best for you.</pre>
