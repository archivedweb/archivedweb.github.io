<pre>I just wanted to verify Code Myster's rings of the dark experiment 
for you naysayers out there.  I did a real stupid thing yesterday - I 
started a local game in hell mode, went to see Griz and Wirt, then 
forgetting it was in hell mode decided to do a Laz run.  I started 
teleporting around L13 and lasted all of 2 seconds before the poison 
spitters(?) and blood knights got me.  I've been trying to get 
everything back, but it's been a harrowing experience since I had 
just traded away my backup armor the previous game.  I tried starting 
caves, then cats, but it's near suicide for a L32 rogue without good 
armor.  (5 simultaneous archers can take down your mana shield and 
kill you in a about a second.)

So I left the game running throughout the day and picked up tonight 
at L1.  I happened to find a topaz amulet of the dark (11&#37; resist 
all, -40&#37; light, go figure) and a mace of the night (-20&#37; 
light) giving me -60&#37; light total.  Having read Code's report, 
and having the tools available to duplicate the experiment, I figured 
why not.

It works.

The monsters just stand there.  If you activate them, most of them 
just wander aimlessly unable to find you.  Some creatures *can* lock 
on to you if you fire at them from afar (horned demons).  But 
otherwise it is pathetically easy as long as you have enough 
infravision scrolls and are careful not to activate monsters.  I'm 
going to have to report my findings to the guild and see if we want 
to ban the practice - it's that easy.

I'll also verify that even with a light source nearby, monsters 
*don't* appear on your screen until they're within your diminished 
range of vision.  So this trick is near impossible without 
infravision scrolls.

Also, I don't think Code ever got around to explaining how the game 
targets monsters.  It works the way I've always thought it did.  You 
fire/cast at the floor tile the cursor is above.  The only exception 
is when a monster is highlighted, in which case it targets the square 
that monster is on (with the diminished light radius, you can't 
&#34;see&#34; the monster so it never gets highlighted, requiring you 
to aim via the floor tiles).  I've always told people to aim for the 
feet, and apparently I was right.

A couple other notes.  I haven't tried starting the level with normal 
lighting then switching to the dark equipment, but I'll take Code's 
word that it doesn't work.  I did try starting with the dark 
equipment, the taking it off - instant lock-on by a half dozen 
monsters who proceeded to pummel me to my death.  :)

(I'm currently at L8 where there are horned demons *again*.  This has 
got to be the worst monster configuration I've run across for an 
equipment recovery mission in hell mode.  Archers on L2-L8, horned 
demons on L7-L8, dogs on L9 and L13, blood knights on L13...  
Arrrrgh.  Wish me luck.)</pre>
