&#62; This post is just a question for all of you who know about the case 
&#62; of the person who got their 3rd dot with a level 18 warrior, legit.
&#62; 
&#62; He supposedly wore a ring of darkness, Gotterdamerung, and used 
&#62; infravision scrolls.  I have this comment.
&#62; 
&#62; My level 39 mage found NIGHTSCAPE which is an AC 15 cape which gives -
&#62; 40&#37; light radius.  I used Nightscape with Gotterdamerung which 
&#62; gave me -80&#37; light radius total.  I also used a Kings sword of 
&#62; Haste (since dreamflange gives +20&#37; light radius).  Also used 
&#62; were rings of the heavens, amulet of the zodiac, and saintly sheild 
&#62; of the tiger.
&#62; 

I thought one had to kill diablo on all 3 dificulties in order to get 
all 3 dots? If this IS true then it would have been impossible for 
his level to even get into all 3 dificulties. Unless ofcourse he used 
a cheat to increase his level then decrease it once he was in the 
game. If I am incorrect about my information please tell me cause I 
am fairly new ot the game.

&#62; The square I was standing on was completely lit up, and the 8 squares 
&#62; around me were 1/2 lit up, and everything else was pitch black 
&#62; (except for the infravision effects).  What happened is that I got my 
&#62; ass kicked.  The monsters saw me from several squares away (at least 
&#62; 5 squares away in a direct line) and would attack me.  I want to know 
&#62; why.
&#62; 
&#62; Do the monsters 'see' you more easily if you have a high magic stat?  
&#62; Assuming that the warrior who told his tale about his 3rd dot was NOT 
&#62; lying, the monsters should not have been able to see me except for 
&#62; when they are 1, maybe 2 squares away.  There is NO WAY the warrior 
&#62; could have navigated through Hell/Hell without dying in a heartbeat 
&#62; if the monsters could see him as well as they were seeing my level 39 
&#62; mage.  So this brings up the following questions:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Was the warrior who accomplished this feat wearing MORE than -
&#62; 80&#37; light radius?  Was he at -100&#37;? I can't remember his 
&#62; exact items.  I know he used Gotterdamerung and a ring of darkness, 
&#62; at a minimum.
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  Do the monsters 'see' you better based upon your level and/or 
&#62; magic statistic?
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  Was the person who made the original post lying?  (If you didn't 
&#62; follow the original thread, be assured that most, if not all of his 
&#62; claims were wrung out to dry in this forum).  He was able to refute 
&#62; every arguement which would have 'defeated' his claim.
&#62; 
&#62; Anyone who can answer any of these 3 questions, please post.
&#62; 
&#62; Just curious,
&#62; 
&#62; Loki,
&#62; Legit level 40 mage (finally made it to 40!)</pre>
