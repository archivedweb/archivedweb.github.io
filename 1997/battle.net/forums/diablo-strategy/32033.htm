<pre>1. At least I think we are on 107 now. I can't remember. Anyway, I 
discovered a useful tactic with chain lightning last night in 
nightmare/hell that I thought was worth relating. Consider:

  ################    ###############  #####
1                   p             2
############################################

Player, p, is adventuring and clearing a level. The player is using a 
spiral clear pattern, where he does the outermost rooms first and 
works his way inward. If the player is clearing from west to east and 
came from 1, he should teleport to 3 and chain the room clear of 
mobs, m. If he is clearing from east to west and has come from 2, he 
should teleport to 4 and chain.

This is very effective against flankers (balrog, goatmen) and 
zigzaggers (Drakes). Balrog like to flank, and by porting to a corner 
and chaining, you limit their range of motion to a 90degree arc about 
the corner, and increase your odds of hitting them considerably. If 
you stand in the middle of the room, balrog will flank and run around 
a full 360degrees about your position, reducing your odds of hitting. 
Even backing up against the wall reduces their motion to a 180deg 
arc. For zigzaggers, sitting in the corner sets up bolts along the 
diagonal into which the zigzaggers move. 

By porting to the side of the room nearest the area you have already 
cleared, you insure that no bolts will target back into the wall (the 
west wall in the case of 3, east in the case of 4). Some may ask why 
not port to positions 5 or 6. Well the answer is that there is a 
large uncleared portion to the south in the center of the level, 
where your bolts will target unseen mobs behind walls (credit Zamp 
with the discovery of chain targeting mobs behind walls).

I have found this method of chaining to be far more effective than 
porting in than out back to p and chaining. Balrog and drakes used to 
be difficult, now they drop in droves. Another plus is everything 
dies in the room making finding that dropped ring a lot easier. If  
you are in a hall and balrog are chasing you, lead them into a room 
and find your corner to chain them.

In regards to clear patterns, try this

1     2      3  Start in a corner of the level. Here I start in the
                NW corner, although any corner will do. Then clear
                the mid wall (2) and next corner (3), until you
8     9      4  have the perimeter cleared (8). Repeat on inner rooms.


7     5      6

2. Fireball levels are levels where you have lightning immune 
creatures and fire vulnerables. I have had some more experiences here 
that may be of value. I used to be of the opinion that stone + 
fireball was the mana effective way to go for hell/hell and nightmare 
hell. Recently I have taken a liking to guardian + fireball. I have 
guardian up at a high enough level now where the damage from a single 
hit puts a creature in stun. I have found that setting a few 
guardians up slows the charge of the creatures, and helps you target 
creatures better with fireball. Many times they will be trapped in 
stun by the guardian and you can pop them with fireball. Guardian 
also has the flushing/lighting/scouting benefits as well. I also have 
a mindcry now, and 69 charges last a nice long time. I think the need 
to stone really depends alot on whether you are a Naj plate wizard or 
whether you like blessed or better full plate. One of my wizards is 
the armor type, and illusion weavers and such cant hit him even on 
hell settings (210 ac), where the other one likes the Naj plate and 
spell adders and hidden/illusion weavers are a serious threat.

3. An interesting note on guardian is that the spell does seem to 
hurt your coop player. I was grouped with a rogue, and we had 
illusion weavers. The weavers would show up on the rogue or me, and 
the guardians would hit the rogue a lot. It seems that if you are 
close to a guardian, and in a line of fire between it and its target, 
you will get hit (although the guardian does not seem to hit me). Has 
anyone else noticed this? The rogue was not to pleased with my 
guardians killing her a couple times.
