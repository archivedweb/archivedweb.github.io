<pre>it was definitly a 100&#37; legit game in my opinion. this is a multi 
player game. if u wanna finish hell by urself, then why play with 
others. we might be high levels but we could die in nite hell, or at 
least me, i almost died in a few cases, just in case u dont know. as 
for stoning the monsters, yes its easier but its tactics! not 
cheating. a level 30 mage would ve done or should ve done the same 
thing when they r accompanyed by a rogue. we help each other out. 
think about it, if we werent there, aahz would spend a lot more time 
clearing those soul burners in level 15. now was he cheating then? 
hell no. this is what u do in a co op games. u help each other out. 
thats the fun part.

one more thing i dont see the level thing as any thing huge. u can 
find any items that i had on, and the only difference in my rogue 
than urs is the dex. and 18hp and 18 manas or something like that. 
other than that we r almost the same. its not the level of the 
character, is ur skills. not to make u feel conceded or anything but 
u played one hell of a rogue. it doesnt matter what level u r. u 
positioned urself very well, and we all made a great combo i ve to 
say. being a rogue is all about positioning. u have to set urself in 
a position that gives u the most adventage. plain and simple. u were 
in positions that u ll kill the monsters and u wont get shot by me. 
and thats what counts. (getting off topic here).

anyhow, i absolutly disagree with u calling last nite game not 
100&#37; legit. i would play 1000 of these games if i can. cos i 
enjoyed it so much.

cya tonite! and we will have a 100&#37; legit game again =)
