&#62; 
&#62; For all you people who need HELP!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; The butcher can be ONE tough customer. Especially in the beginning of 
&#62; the game, because he USUALLY appears on level 2. And most people will 
&#62; go into his room because they have NO idea who's in there. If you 
&#62; don't want to become &#34;Fresh Meat,&#34; and you are not level 10 
&#62; yet, read this.
&#62; 
&#62; First, Play NEW GAMES and clear out level one until your STR is 40, 
&#62; and you have enough gold to buy a Claymore. Buy a Claymore. Buy 
&#62; leather armor. Equip your new junk. Now, fight down to level 4 (Here 
&#62; you'll usuall find the Weak Goat person) (Pleeease, No Hurt, no 
&#62; kill!) and get the Goat guy's weapon he'll give you after you spare 
&#62; him. Now, go into the blody room on level 2, and attack the butcher. 
&#62; Make sure you have LOTSA FULL HEALING potions. Just keep clicking on 
&#62; him, and press a belt potion hotkey whenever your health gets low. He 
&#62; should die, and you'll get his cleaver, which is a VERY GOOD WEAPON!
&#62; 

Kain,

Thanks for relating your experiences for everyone, but I there are 
easier ways to kill the Butcher.  In fact, very low level characters 
can easily do it.  These techniques have been reviewed on the forum 
several times in the past, but given that this is a common problem 
for beginners, I figured it couldn't hurt to repost them.

All you need is a bow.  With this in hand, there are two techniques 
that I know of that can take down the Butcher.  By the way, the 
butcher is ALWAYS on level 2, in my experience.

1.  Grate method:  Before opening the butcher's chamber, clear the 
rest of the level, and find a place where there is an unblocked door 
and grate walls (the ones you can shoot through).  Open the butcher's 
door to activate him, and run.  Lead him to the door, and quickly 
close it behind you.  The butcher cannot open it.  He'll just pace 
back and forth in front of it.  Position yourself so you can shoot 
him with the bow through the grate.  Click, click, click ....  It 
will take some time, but he'll go down.

2.  Stairs method:  This method is similar to the grate method and 
easier, but slightly cheezy, in my opinion (although I've done it 
many times.)  It takes advantage of an AI weakness that the butcher 
has.  Clear the level except for the Butcher, as above.  Locate the 
stairs down to level 3.  Lead the Butcher to the stairs.  Now, run 
around the stairs so that you are on the back side of them.  Your 
goal is to get him &#34;trapped&#34; in the stairs.  You may have to 
let him chase you around the stairs a few times, but eventually you 
will be sucessful.  Maybe a simple diagram will help.

    P
  XXXXX
  X B X

Take up a position at P, leading the Butcher into the staircase at B. 
 Once you are in these positions, the Butcher will just stand there.  
Take out your bow, and let him have it.


A couple of notes for both of these tactics:  Be sure to use the 
&#34;shift&#34; key when firing your bow.  This is especially 
important in the stairs method, where one missed click could turn the 
Butcher loose again.  Also, it's a good idea to take along a town 
portal scroll, in case you have to make a hasty retreat.

Anyway, I hope this helps.  Have fun, and good luck.
