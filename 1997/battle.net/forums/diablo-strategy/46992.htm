<pre>&#62; I know i was being made fun of so I admit i wasn't &#34;The 
&#62; Expert&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; The reason I got &#34;flamed&#34; is because I said I was an expert, 
&#62; and people didn't think so. So thats Why I admit that i'm not an 
&#62; expert, i'm just willing to help anyone with a question not to brag 
&#62; or anything.
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry I don't know anything about the nova

Well, the reason you got flamed is that your behavior was like a 
spammer. That's that.

I see your good will in helping people, but you can do it better by 
reply those help needed posts out there from newbies. There are such 
posts, always. It's much better than keep posting &#34;anyone needs 
help?&#34;. You know, when anyone needs, he'll ask for it.

About the expert thing, Chinese wise men said that you ain't too old 
to learn anything, you never will. So I suggest you to read others' 
posts, you'll always get new knowledge from regular folks and others. 
I'm sure you'll have many more stuff to put in your web site, rather 
than basic information people can find it anywhere. This forum is 
somewhat fun and has kept me here, although real life makes me go 
away sometimes. 

Just keep your eyes opened on this forum, you'll find it's fun.

Tee... just try to do the right thing...</pre>
