&#62; I enjoyed starting a new Mage and playing to the Cats with a new 
&#62; group Diablo players.
&#62; 
&#62; We were on level 3 last night, me and two level 7 warriors and could 
&#62; not kill the King.  I did not have Holy Bolt(even went down a level 
&#62; to look for one)  and the witch was not coughing any.  But I swear, 
&#62; we would hack on his butt for an eternity until we ran out of health 
&#62; and mana, go back up, refuel, and come back down and do it again.  
&#62; This must have happend at least 4 to 6 times.  Still he would not die.
  Been there, done that

&#62; 
&#62; I was wondering if we leave the level to refuel, does the King's 
&#62; health get reset as well?  
  I'm pretty sure that any monster will start to regenerate their
hit points (at least, that's what the manual says); just make your 
refuling fast, so it minimizes his.

&#62; There are times that I can hit him with 
&#62; Holy Bolt, maybe 20 times and its over.  But hack him with a sword 
&#62; and you will be there for a long time.   
   Well, there's part of your problem!!  A sword against Leoric just
doesn't cut it, so to speak.  Have your warrior palls use blunt 
weapons instead--it'll make much shorter work of 'im, believe me.

&#62; 
&#62; The two warriors finally gave up and call it a night.  I could not 
&#62; leave until that sack o bones was dead.   I ended up finding a mana 
&#62; shield scroll and sat in a corner with a majical charged bolt staff 
&#62; and FINALLY killed him.  He coughed up a jagged saber which I will 
&#62; give to one of the warriors tonight, when we continue our quest.  
Here's an idea i just came up with if you have 2 warrirors against 
Leoric.  Have your warriors buy as many potions as you can afford-
hopefully, this will more than fill your belts.  Then, have both 
engage (with magical support, of course).  He can only attack one at 
a time; when one runs out of potions, have him withdraw out of harm's 
way.  Leoric will hack at the other guy, while the first one can 
quickly restock his belt with the extra potions in his inventory.
This should cut down the number of times you need to make a full 
retreat, and thus minimize the time Leoric has to regenerate!!
&#62; 
&#62; If you made it this far, you are truly addicted to Diablo, and, like 
&#62; me, you anxiously await a sequel or expansion pack, similar to 
&#62; WarCraft2's where only the strong can survive.  
&#62; 
&#62; Good Hunting,
&#62; 
&#62; Voyager

  You should check out the lengths of some of the other posts here-
if you've got a couple days.  (I'm almost as guilty as anyone-almost 
. . .)  Have you gotten to the end animation yet (maybe with another 
character, or solo)?  If you have, you'll agree with me (like Brett 
did--it was Brett, right?) that Blizzard really set the plot for a
sequal.  If you haven't, then it's something to look forward to.

fight the good fight,
