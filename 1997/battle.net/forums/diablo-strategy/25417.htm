&#62; Ever since I hit level 35, all the books I look at require 255 magic.

    I think that's just the way it is.  I don't think you can do 
anything about that.

 
&#62; As other posters have noted, rogues cannot attain that lvl of magic, 
&#62; no matter what sorcery/wizard stuff they wear.

   This is true, so why worry about it?

&#62; My Stone Curse is maxed at lvl 8, my Fireball at 10, and my Chain 
&#62; Lighting at 9.  I cannot advance any more, no matter what I do.
&#62; 
&#62; Technically, I can search out Enchanted shrines, but: (a) I might 
&#62; decrease one of my key spells; and (b) I don't want to spend days 
&#62; looking to get all my key spells up to lvl 15.
&#62; 
&#62; I have decided to kill off my character, and then restart with a new 
&#62; rogue.  I will keep all my stuff by leaving it with a friend in a 
&#62; game, then delete my rogue and create another one with the same name. 
&#62;  I don't want to give up what I've earned in many long hours of 
&#62; battle.

    If the problem is that you can't attain the necessary 255 magic 
no matter what you do or wear, how is creating a new character going 
to help?  You'll still hit the 255 barrier and be unable to advance.  
I could be wrong, but I think the amount of magic necessary to read a 
book depends directly on your current spell level, so once you hit a 
certain level with a spell you'll need 255 magic to advance it any 
more, which you can never attain, so why bother tossing out a 
perfectly good character?

     I also question how much fun it can possibly be to play a 1st 
level rogue who has 35th level equipment.  If you want to start over, 
start over from scratch, you'll have more fun.

&#62; Once the new character reaches lvl 20, I intend to go down to the 
&#62; church for easy money and keep checking with the witch for books, 
&#62; untill all my key spells are maxed.  I think that's the only way I 
&#62; can do it.  

    As I said, you will have the same problem you have now - you can 
never attain the 255 magic necessary to max your spells.

&#62; 
&#62; As a bonus, I won't bother reading books for those crappy spells that 
&#62; I never use & that just clutter up my screen when I use the 
&#62; &#34;S&#34; key.  :-)

   Whatever.
&#62; 
&#62; What do you think?  Let me know, please.  I intend to go through with 
&#62; this, but I'm interested in others' opinions.

     It sounds like you're going to go to a lot of work just to run 
into the same problem again...


Just my $0.02
