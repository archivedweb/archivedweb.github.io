&#62; Here are my opinions on cheating, I appreciate feedback on whether or 
&#62; not you people agree, or disagree with my thoughts, so here goes:
&#62; 

I usually don't like to get involved in these discussions, but here 
are my opinions...

&#62; 
&#62; 1.)  Using any program that alters your character IS cheating (ex:  
&#62; raising exp, gold, stats, spell levels, or adding items)
&#62; 

Agree.

&#62; 2.)  Backing up/Restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating, and 
&#62; I am not going to use the old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse.  In 
&#62; single player Diablo, if you get your ass whipped by some demons, all 
&#62; you have to do is restore from your last save, well, there is NO 
&#62; reason that multiplayer should be any different, especially with the 
&#62; added risk of pkillers, and the like.
&#62;

Sure it is. In multi-player, your death has an effect on others. If 
you die
and lose your precious stuff to another player, why should you be able
to use a backup to recover your KSOH/Dreamflange/Windforce or
whatever great items you've lost? That item belongs to that other 
player
now.

This would be another way to 'dupe' items - I'll just enter a game, 
drop
that Obs Ring of Zod,  then leave the game and recover my character.

As for Pking, it's part of the game. Blizzard put that 'player attack'
button there for a reason. You just have to watch your back. In life,
we get backstabbed all the time, why should it be any different in a
game that requires interaction with other players.

&#62; 3.)  Transferring characters to/from single player and multiplayer is 
&#62; NOT cheating.  If the character has not been altered by external 
&#62; programs, or hacked in some way, then this transfer is perfectly 
&#62; legitimate, after all, why should someone spend weeks, building up a 
&#62; single player character, just to find out that if they want to play 
&#62; multiplayer, then they will have to start all over from level 1!
&#62; 

There are items in the single-player games that are not available in
the multi-player games. So I think it's cheating.

&#62; 4.)  In multiplayer games, high-level players, giving things to lower 
&#62; level characters is alright, IF they are normally obtainable by that 
&#62; lower level player, such as a level 20 rouge, giving a level 5 
&#62; warrior a few healing potions, but it should not be takken too far!  
&#62; Such as giving a plate of armor that the lower level character would 
&#62; not have access to for levels to come.  I am sick and tired of seeing 
&#62; extremely low level characters such as levels 1-12 having Godly 
&#62; plates of the Whale, and Obsidian rings of the Zodiac, and Dragon's 
&#62; amulets of the zodiac, and King's swords of haste, these things are 
&#62; EXTREMELY rare and should not be found untill really high levels, I 
&#62; get on B-net all the time, and I always see this, level 1-12 people 
&#62; having better equipment than me (level 16 Warrior), and you know 
&#62; someone just gave it to them.
&#62; 

If the item is 'legit', I see no problem with giving it away. It will 
make
the game very boring for the low level characters.

&#62; 5.)  Dupping IS cheating.  If people did not dupe, then the problem 
&#62; in #4 would not exist, if King's swords of haste were as rare as they 
&#62; SHOULD be, NOBODY would be giving them away.
&#62; 

If duping could not be done, people will still be giving away things 
they
don't need. A 1st lvl character can still get very good stuff. But 
that
KSOH would be much more valuable and not likely be giving away freely.

&#62; 6.)  Also, using a program such as a Trainer, that can grant immunity 
&#62; to other players attacks is NOT cheating (unless dueling of coarse) 
&#62; because of the vast number of dumbshit PKers that are out there, one 
&#62; HAS to protect oneself.
&#62; 
Kinda goes against statement #1. You are altering your character to 
get
immunity.

Again, PKing is part of the game.

&#62; I appreciate you time and efforts of reading this, and possible 
&#62; posting of a response.  I am in no way shape or form showing 
&#62; disrespect to anyone, or out to offend anyone, so I hope I have not 
&#62; done so.
&#62; 
No offense taken. We all have our opinions. Thank you for your time.

&#62; Sincerely,
&#62; Anonymouse (Level 16 Warrior)</pre>
