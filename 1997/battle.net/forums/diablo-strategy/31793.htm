<pre>People of the world,

                     Geeze isn't DS so great. Lets all just vote him 
for presidenticy *s*.  I agree with you DS in everything that you 
preach but one thing.  A while ago you posted something like 
&#34;PK's are okay but cheaters suck&#34; well I have to disagree 
with you here.  Pk's are what have ruined the game. Sure, cheaters 
don't help but it is possible to play with a &#34;nice cheater.&#34; 
It is a rareity but it is possible.  Allow me to demonstrate if you 
will.  Say you cstarted a public game (ballsy move) And a mage comes 
in who is about level 19. This guy is wearing armour that he could 
not possibly wear unless he has all the zods he could wear.  So you 
start playing and he comes in and starts casting spells like there is 
no tommorow. They range from elementals to apocalypses. If your in 
trouble it's one swing of that AAA staff and before you can thanx him 
he has healed you up to full strength and gives you three un-
identified equip.  You continue playing and he leaves you alone until 
you ask for help.  But then a Pk, lets say level 42 comes in.  He 
asks you what level you arre on and you send him a portal.  But, as 
soon as he comes in he nocks you down with his axe and takes out the 
mage with another swipe.  Now, this cheater had enough self respect 
to not use god mode and that is what got him killed.  The point of 
this story is that althoug the cheater was a cheat. I still could 
have had a great time playing with him had that PK not showed up.  

Now in your post you said that had he beaten you fairly you would 
acknowlage his greatness and bid him farewell.  Yes if it was a duel 
I can understand that. BUT if he did not warn you, he just came into 
the game and started to kick ass your saying that you wouldn't be the 
slightest bit pissed off?? I sure as hell would be.

In my opinion the only thing worse than a PK is a cheating PK..  

But don't get me wrong. I still think your the greatest guy as your 
not afraid to speak your mind and of course you rescued me from 
&#34;the dark side&#34; I'm just trying to figure out if I'm ab-
normal by hating PK's.


Mystery... lvl 14 rogue (legit)
Demosthenes lvl 17 mage (not so legit *s*)

&#34;Always turn left. To turn right, turn left three times&#34;</pre>
