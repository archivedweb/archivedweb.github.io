&#62; I think I might be able to help you out a bit.  I have been through 
&#62; all of those problems with my sorceror (who is a legit level 40 by 
&#62; the way).  A sorceror's needs constantly change...early on you just 
&#62; need to concentrate on getting your spells advanced and mastering a 
&#62; wide variety, all the while hacking away with the weapons of the 
&#62; common warrior because you don't have squat for mana.  The middle 
&#62; stages are a little easier because not only do you have your favorite 
&#62; spells down, but you have some pretty cool melee weapons too.  But of 
&#62; course, it's the end stages you are probably worried about.  The 
&#62; sorceror is the best character to have in hell...you probably already 
&#62; know that.  But the key is WHY he is the best character...magic.  

does arrow sound good to u?

You 
&#62; can handle anything you encounter with magic, even those pesky triple 
&#62; immune soul-burning, yellow-crap-throwing witches.

so can arrows.

  Master using 
&#62; movement spells, like teleport, and try throwing some well placed 
&#62; guardians to weaken them before they get on you.  When they start to 
&#62; close in, teleport away and see if you can hit a couple of them with 
&#62; stone curse.  Get your whacks in with your sword (get a sword of 
&#62; haste if you can), then teleport away again when the heat's on.  It 
&#62; may be slow-going, but it's effective.  And remember to be ready to 
&#62; throw a town portal if you have to...always have an out.

aways throw a portal is you have to or not. this is one of the common 
mistake u ll make for losing all ur items. but in ur case saintm, it 
doesnt really matter that much, no offence but u can always find 
better ones.

&#62; As far as Chain Lightning goes, there is no relief.  Even with my 
&#62; high mana and level 17 CL spell it seems to suck down the juice.  
&#62; It's the nature of the spell; you keep this continuous flow of 
&#62; lightning going, so it continually drains your mana.  This is an 
&#62; important spell though...even monsters that are apparently immune to 
&#62; lightning will eventually die if chained enough.

what kind of a CL do u have that can kill a monster thats immune to 
lightning? my level 18 or even 20 CL cant kill one bitch thats triple 
immune if i use lightning all day.

&#62; As far as equipment goes, a sword of haste or something that gives 
&#62; you fast attack is a must...the rest depends on your preferences.  I 
&#62; try to concentrate on raising my magic, mana, and AC.  I figure magic 


this really depends on what type of mage u r SM. since ur a warrior 
before, u might have the mentality of using a sword which in some 
cases r find. but DO NOT call the legendary DF a stupid mace, as the 
post below stated, it adds about 110 manas not 30. and it increases 
ur spell level... i ll give u the doubt that u had never seen one. 
but if u do find one, df and stormshield is a damn good combo over 
all. the fast block is one of the best thing for the tiny mage. well 
if u have a kings sword of haste, then use it sometimes. unfortunatly 
i dont, so i cant comment much on that. AC is also optional. some 
people prefer an awesome full plate of sorc, some prefer a naj lite 
plate. i use the afpos cos i like to be surrounded and bomb them, ur 
chop them in half. my ac is 265 the stats on my afpos is ac 74 
150&#37; +20 yeah yeah i know ur jealous =) i love my plate.

on the other hand if u wanna play a true mage, then find a naj lite 
plate, use an aa staff then u ll have a level 20 fireball and cl in 
no time but still u cant kill any triple immune with those 2, so u 
either need a nice sword (not that stupid mace in this case), or some 
strong warrors, ops i mean golems to kill them for u.

just in case u wanna know what i have, so u can maybe look for these 
items, here is a list (im not trying to brag what i have, just trying 
to help.)

thinking cap (a must for mages)
awesome full plate of sorc
that stupid mace
stormshield
dragons ring of zod
obs ring of harmony (u do need some harmony items btw)
jade amulet of giants

hope this helped
