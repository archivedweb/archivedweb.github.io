<pre>Upon reading about a possible problem with monsters with long range 
attacks, i would suggest that a warrior would try to max on the 
resistances and get a high ac ASAP.  I personally endorse stone curse 
(cast 2 maybe 3 times from full mana ball)as a must have against the 
long range attacks.  This comes from some of the experiences that I 
have had in the past with soul burners, where low resistance means 
death and the lack of stone curse could lead to a lot of burners 
frying you in a matter of seconds regardless of ac.  Of course you 
also want to make such that you have a good weapon also, dispatch of 
baddies quickly thus minimizing the damage from the monsters not 
stoned.   U don't have to rush into rooms to battle thing that have 
long range attacks, if possible draw them out in smaller groups.  
Hope some of this helps and is somewhat coherent.

&#62; &#62; i believe blizzard calls this game an action RPG, am i right?
&#62; &#62; so if it is an RPG the a have a few questions for u people. a mage 
&#62; &#62; would do anything to boost his powers in the magic area if magic 
&#62; &#62; existed rght? so, why does everybody want a zod ring????? a real mage 
&#62; &#62; would rather have a wyrm's ring of wizadry than a obsidian zod ring, 
&#62; &#62; corect? same with warriors, if u want to use the best magic, BE A 
&#62; &#62; MAGE!!!! stop trying to boost all your magic up to use lvl 15 
&#62; &#62; fireball! instead focus on beating the crap out of stuff! (thats what 
&#62; &#62; u are good at :). but rouges are different. sure u should boost ur 
&#62; &#62; dex up, but blizzard made them to be able to fight and use mid lvl 
&#62; &#62; spells. thats why they are the best class :) yes mages can fry 
&#62; &#62; everything naked, so why worry about a zod ring when u can use a wiz 
&#62; &#62; ring?
&#62; &#62; when u are naked u don't need strength, so to all u mages who say we 
&#62; &#62; don't need armor, DON'T USE IT THEN!!! just wear magic and mana 
&#62; &#62; boosting equipment to kick @$$!!!! i have a mage, and i love him for 
&#62; &#62; his magic prowess, but i like my rouge better for her way to easily 
&#62; &#62; handle any situiation.sure, u mages will say get her cornered and 
&#62; &#62; she's dead, but remember we can teleport to :) we also have life and 
&#62; &#62; magic to go through, and with windforce we can keep the baddies back.
&#62; &#62; but wait, we can stone things too!!!! :)
&#62; &#62; well, i know a bunch of mages, and like i said i love mine, so Aahz, 
&#62; &#62; i don't do this out of mage hate :). people will be mad at me 
&#62; &#62; starting this debate, but i am not debating, i am mearly telling 
&#62; &#62; people what an rpg is supposed to be like, e-mail me if u like, i get 
&#62; &#62; bored saoetoimes and would love to read your posts.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; -alvais lvl 33 rogue LEGIT!
&#62; &#62; -alvain lvl 14 mage LEGIT!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; ok its time to reveal my secret, woooooo. well i have a level 38 
&#62; rogue, a level 15 warrior, and a level 40, yes 40 mage. i got the 
&#62; mage so high for 2 reason, one accident, i kept on using him to help 
&#62; newbies and hunting in nite hell that i forgot about the levels. 
&#62; mages do frow fast. and the second reason is i want a fair argument 
&#62; if this debate does come up again.
&#62; 
&#62; well guess what, it here. well, i think the mage is very powerful, 
&#62; fun to play with. but slightly too powerful sometimes. if u r playing 
&#62; a co op game, ur partners better watch out for that level 20 fireball 
&#62; coming. they r good for co op games if u play it safe. as Aahz plays, 
&#62; he uses stone. now this is the best type of mages. they do not try to 
&#62; out do what they should do (huh? does that make sense?) . 
&#62; 
&#62; mages r fun but i like my rogue better. cos it requires a lot more 
&#62; strategy. using of walls and doorways is a must. and i like the fact 
&#62; that i dont have to worry about immune to all witches in hell hell. 
&#62; with the help of an experience mage, a rogue can clear hell hell 
&#62; easily.
&#62; 
&#62; i just started a warrior, but i shouldnt give my opinion on them yet, 
&#62; cos i m only 15. but it is definitly the hardest class to play for 
&#62; me. without range attack, its damn hard to play. what m i suppose to 
&#62; do when i see 20 arrows shooting goats? actually bloodstart shooting 
&#62; goats. although this hasnt occured yet, but what happens if i see 
&#62; those witches? i need some suggestion.
&#62; 
&#62; in my conclusion, i think there is no best class (yes brett i know u 
&#62; ll be happy to hear this). but there is a class that u can like or 
&#62; use the best. and for me, thats the rogue. this is a preference 
&#62; thing. u like to eat harveys, i like to eat mac donalds. simple as 
&#62; that. and alvais likes mac donalds as well. =)
&#62; 
&#62; DarkSniper
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; PS, i just got fined $105.00 in court so mabye i am just pissed off 
&#62; &#62; and need to vent :) if u are a mage and i know u don't be mad, just 
&#62; &#62; give me a good slap in the face :)
&#62; 
&#62; p.s. i ll think twice before i use fireworks next time al... well at 
&#62; least u didnt go to jail =) egg ur neighbours! maybe u ll get another 
&#62; fine. </pre>
