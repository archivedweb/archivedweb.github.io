<pre>Like my original post says below, all of the ideas we could think of 
to refute his claim were checked out.  You CAN have any level 
character join a HELL difficulty game if you have a level 30+ 
character start a game and you join via modem.  He had a friend start 
a hell game, and set up a portal to hell (I think).  Or, since he was 
level 18, he could have gotten into hell by himself?  Anyway, it 
doesn't matter.  Also, killing diablo on Hell difficulty WILL GIVE 
YOU ALL 3 DOTS, EVEN IF YOU HAD NONE TO BEGIN WITH.

&#62; I thought one had to kill diablo on all 3 dificulties in order to get 
&#62; all 3 dots? If this IS true then it would have been impossible for 
&#62; his level to even get into all 3 dificulties. Unless ofcourse he used 
&#62; a cheat to increase his level then decrease it once he was in the 
&#62; game. If I am incorrect about my information please tell me cause I 
&#62; am fairly new ot the game.
&#62; 
&#62; Yours truely
&#62; ~&#60;Xenocide&#62;~


&#62; &#62;(If you didn't 
&#62; &#62; follow the original thread, be assured that most, if not all of his 
&#62; &#62; claims were wrung out to dry in this forum).  He was able to refute 
&#62; &#62; every arguement which would have 'defeated' his claim.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Anyone who can answer any of these 3 questions, please post.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Just curious,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Loki,
&#62; &#62; Legit level 40 mage (finally made it to 40!)</pre>
