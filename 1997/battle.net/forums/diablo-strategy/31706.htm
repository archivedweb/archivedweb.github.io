<pre>First of all I would like to thanks Darksniper for setting up the 
meeting on BNET sunday. Some of you who were there might have seen me 
since I was the only person there who played the spawned version(im 
gonna get the full version soon so dont flame me on that).  Even 
though i couldnt stay long i still enjoyed it when i was therer.  
Also to Darksniper.  A couple of pages back u made a post on small 
useless clans that are out there.  One of the things that make a good 
clan leader is someone who knows about the game.  You flamed some guy 
because he didnt know as much as u did about some aspects about 
diablo.  Instead of critizing him did you ever consider telling him 
about the things he didnt know so he could become a better leader.

Now to my other point.  I just finished reading Codes survey on what 
is considerd cheating.  One of the main points was about doing stuff 
for newbies.  I just want to know exactly what u thing a newbie is.  
I s a newbie someone who is new to battle.net or just someone who has 
a new character.  If Azh started over with a new Sorcerer would he be 
considered a newbie.  I am just curious as to your opinions.</pre>
