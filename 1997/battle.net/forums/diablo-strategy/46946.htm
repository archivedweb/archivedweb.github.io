&#62;   I played in a game last night with at least one duped up char. A 
&#62; mage who got to see a pure magic style from me.
&#62;   He noticed that I couldn't take hits in nightmare caves. While in 
&#62; town he decided to &#34;help me out&#34; with some better items;)I 
&#62; was having Grizz take a look at my thinker (dam lag) when he through 
&#62; down his &#34;killer&#34; ring, obsidian ring of the zodiak.  I 
&#62; decided to throw down a couple I was holding to give him, help him 
&#62; out :) One -7 to all, one -6 to all a ring of weakness a ring of the 
&#62; dark, etc... He thought I was nuts, hehehehe... He wouldnt stay on 
&#62; the same screen with me after this. Hey Woody I may have to keep them 
&#62; rings....... put them on if I wana mess with some pk mind...
&#62; 
&#62; violence   having a blast

Hehe, if only I found the legendary ring of corruption and put it on 
my mage. I wonder what those cheaters/pkers will think. It probably 
makes them go insane. :)

Tee... set his next goal to a golden lv30 mage...</pre>
