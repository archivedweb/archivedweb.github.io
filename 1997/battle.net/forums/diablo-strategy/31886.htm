<pre>Only one question.  'Saintly' is something like +100&#37; - 
+125&#37;.  You only stated +76&#37;, which would be something like 
'grand' armor.  If your memory of 'saintly' is correct, this is the 
plate I would use without a doubt.  In fact, Awesome plate of sorcery 
is probably (argueably) the best plate in the game (unless Godly or 
Holy full plate in multiplayer really exists).  Saintly is just a 
step below Awesome for AC.  So I would use the Saintly plate of 
sorcery over the others forever (unless you find awesome plate of 
sorcery).   Armor class GREATLY reduces your chance of being hit by 
physical attacks.  Also, to compensate for the damage that the 
witches inflict, you should boost your resistances via rings/helm/bow 
or whatever method you can.  60&#37; or greater 'resistance to magic' 
will help you out there (75&#37; is MAX anyway).

Artemis II
level 40 rogue
Using awesome plate of the ages (would like to have Awesome plate of 
sorcery)

p.s. blood ritual does NOT exist in the released version of Diablo.  
I think it was supposed to take away health and give to mana, the 
opposite of healing.  Its my theory that Blizzard took it out because 
it would be easy to Heal Yourself, then use blood ritual to get back 
mana, essentially pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.  You would 
never need to buy potions again!

&#62; I am a rogue lev28 and have found three different armors. But it's 
&#62; difficult to choose only one or two to have always with me - may be 
&#62; somebody can give me a piece of advice? Here my armors are:
&#62; 1. Saintly Full plate of Sorcery (AC 78, AC +76&#37;, Magic +16)
&#62; 2. Plate of the Whale (AC 16, HP +100)
&#62; 3. Scavengers carapace (-15 damage, AC -10, Dex +5 and something 
&#62; more, I just can't remember)
&#62; 
&#62; Wich one is better for a Rogue and on what level?
&#62; I made out only one thing - that Scavengers carapace is better than 
&#62; others vs. Witches because -15 damage is enough to make their shots 
&#62; not very painful even on Nightmare diff level.
&#62; 
&#62; Thank you very much.

&#62; 
&#62; P.S. I heard about spell called &#34;Blood ritual&#34; but I never 
&#62; found a book or a scroll. Where can I get it?
