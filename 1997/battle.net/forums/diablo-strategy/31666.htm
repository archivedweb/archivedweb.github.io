<pre>&#62;#). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
  
  -Nah.  Money can't buy happiness.  (But can you rent it?)  There's 
little you can do with only gold- even when you're low level.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

  -Nope.  No rule against it.  Otherwise Blizzard would have made 
sure that characters with significant level disparities could not 
participate in the same game.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

  -Nope.  See above.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
 elixers?

  -Nope.  See above.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

  -Nope.  See above.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
 Adria or Griz for items?

  -Nope.  It would have been easy for Blizzard to block this type of 
&#34;shopping.&#34;  Since they didn't, it is not cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

  -Hmmm...I'll have to give this one a &#34;depends.&#34;  If you're 
using it to avoid playing with cheaters, I'd say no.  However, if 
you're using it to check someone out to see if you have a clear 
advantage in a duel, and then basing your decision of whether or not 
to duel with this outside information, then I'd say yes.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
 could not regularly access?

  -Ick.  While I don't feel you should do this, I still have to say 
no, it's not technically cheating.  Again, Blizzard could have 
blocked this if they so desired.  Since they didn't, it's not 
cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
 items?

  -Hmmm...this one is a little tougher under the definition I've been 
using for cheating (which is actually where the fulcrum of the 
cheating versus legit issue ALWAYS is).  Since you can do it within 
the rules of the game, I'll again have to say that it is not cheating.
  
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

  -No.  See above.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

  -Hmmm...now, I'm assuming that there is some &#34;trick&#34; to 
this that I don't know about.  Some bug in the game, maybe?  I'm 
going to have to abstain from this one.  (Unless there's nothing more 
to this than meets the eye.  If you're just using a normal Nova spell 
over and over to kill someone, then I'd say that it is not cheating.)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
  
  -No, it's not cheating.  Interestingly, this is a case where I feel 
cheating has nothing to do with ethics.  However, whether or not it's 
ethical is another debate entirely...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

  -Yes.  You must use a hacked .exe file in order to accomplish this. 
 While I feel you SHOULD be able to Teleport in town, Blizzard did 
not.  Therefore, doing it is cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

  -It's never cheating to backup.  However, restoring is a different 
issue.  (COP OUT!  COP OUT!)  [Don't ever say an accountant doesn't 
use loopholes to his advantage!] 

I'll warn all of you in advance that I may not fill out another 
survey on this forum.  As the subject suggests, I think there are way 
too many surveys out there already.

Looking forward to reading the other replies and also Code's.  Hoping 
to see you tonight, Code- maybe we can talk about this and exchange 
email.

Later,

&#34;All this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted.
 Not so foolish-hearted, it's really just a question of your honesty; 
yeah, your honesty.
 One likes to believe in the freedom of music,
 But glittering prizes and endless compromises shatter the illusion 
of integrity.&#34;
