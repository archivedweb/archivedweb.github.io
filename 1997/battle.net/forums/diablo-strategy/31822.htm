<pre>Ok, I start a normal game last night, thinking a quick hell run.  I 
check out the list of unique monsters I haven't got on the page yet, 
and find that there are three each from levels 12 and 3, so I figure 
odds are good that I might find one.  So before going to hell, I 
wander around the upper levels looking for some of these guys.  I end 
up finding three of them out of 12 or so.  Odds on that don't look so 
good to me.  Out of the 30+ (?) unique guys in the game, I find 3 or 
12 that I haven't already seen?  On top of that, Gutshank drops and 
Immolator.

Finished with unique hunting and getting bored, I head down to clear 
out hell.  Level 13 is inhabited by snow (w/b)itches and balrogs.  In 
five minutes or less the following happens:
a normal balrog drops the Gladiator's Bane
the boss snow witch drops the ring of engagement
Blackskull (balrog boss) drops the rainbow cloak

At this point I'm begining to get a little excited.  Four uniques in 
one game, three on the same level.  This has GOT to be a good game.  
Boy was I wrong.  Apparently all the good stuff got used up on lvl 13 
because the only other thing worth mentioning that came out of that 
game was an obs amulet 37&#37;all.

But there was one other strange thing.  On lvl twelve there was a 
major graphic glitch.  A triangular window about the size of a 
characters sheild appeared in one of the central walls.  Whenever I 
moved around things would scroll around in it, including this bright 
blue line (which is what caught my eye in the first place).  I have 
pics if you're interested in seeing it, but I'm begining to wonder 
with all the errors like this I'm getting if I should reinstall.
