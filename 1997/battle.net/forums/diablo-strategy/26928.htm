&#62; &#62; &#62;    First congrats on thinking up something really interesting, even 
&#62; &#62; if I am still dubious about whether you actually did this or not.  I 
&#62; &#62; wouldn't be so smug about &#34;cheaters&#34; though, since what you 
&#62; &#62; did by using hand-me-downs qualifies as cheating in most peoples 
&#62; &#62; books.
&#62; 
&#62; If it is in the game originally, then how is it cheating?

    Note, please, that I said that &#34;most&#34; people thought this 
was cheating.  Given the responses to the post, I would have to amend 
that to say that &#34;some&#34; people thought this was cheating.  I 
personally have done this etc, but I only made the point because he 
was being so self-righteous about not cheating...

&#62; &#62;      I'm sorry...  Where did you find 30 infravision scrolls?  The 
&#62; &#62; things are kinda rare...  Assuming you did the old, restart a million 
&#62; &#62; times until you can buy what you want from the witch trick, that's 
&#62; &#62; kinda cheating too...
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; How the heck would you think that is cheating. Next thing you will 
&#62; think co op play is cheating.

       Next you'll think before vomiting up some silly comment like 
this.  Think about it - when you enter a game it is randomly seeded.  
If you restart a million times, buying up the good stuff each time, 
then not only do you need a hobby, but you are not playing the game 
as it was intended to be played.  

      Its like cheating at poker by peeking at the cards as you deal 
them - it changes the odds as they were intended to be.

&#62; &#62;      See now, this makes me a little suspicious, because if you had 
&#62; &#62; ever actually been to hell, you would have realized that you don't 
&#62; &#62; lose your equipment when you die on level 16...   Hmmmmmmm.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Maybe he didn't die when he beat Diablo before....

   What are the chances that this person, who seems to know his 
Diablo pretty well, has never died on level 16 - EVER?   Pretty damn 
slim I'd say.  Engage your brain Nate.

&#62; &#62;      This doesn't explain how you could have gotten to the skull 
&#62; &#62; lever in the spiral room...  I sincerely doubt you could have snuck 
&#62; &#62; by all of those knights in that tiny corridor, and you certainly 
&#62; &#62; couldn't have killed all of them if you had trouble earlier with just 
&#62; &#62; one knight.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; He said that he could be within 1 square on a diagonal. Yes, he could 
&#62; live and do this.

      Maybe....  As I said, I'm dubious.



&#62; &#62;      Still, a pretty interesting idea...
&#62; 
&#62; Not an idea, a fact. Why would this guy make up this story. Anyways, 
&#62; if you thought of this, you would think that it would be impossible.
&#62; I believe him.

     No Nate - Facts are independently verifiable.  This is not.</pre>
