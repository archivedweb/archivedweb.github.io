<pre>I am not going to post a long reply answering Aahzmadius' quesitons 
here, since he already knows my opinions.  Just thought I would point 
out how well the tactics do work.  The key here is to play together 
for a while.  If you can be disciplined as a group these tactics work 
very well (I prefer starting with tactic #2 and bouncing to #1 if 
there are alot of melee monsters on a givin level.)  I think the 
biggest point is to be DISCIPLINED.  If one character gets impatient, 
he can bring upon the wrath of Hell and it gets VERY frustrating for 
those in the group who are playing by the tactic.  Remember if you 
are going to play a group game, you might as well play as a group.  
Great post Aahz, keep up the good work!

&#62; I assume that ideas like this have been posted before.  However, I'm 
&#62; fairly new to this forum, and I haven't seen one quite like it 
&#62; (perhaps it was an early spellcasting class that I missed?), so I 
&#62; thought I'd post something for the people out there who are new to 
&#62; the forum also.  I apologize for any repitition to you veteran forum 
&#62; readers.
&#62; 
&#62; I've used a mage for awhile, and so I know a little about the 
&#62; subject.  Please keep in mind that the following ideas are based on 
&#62; the assumption that the group will be staying together (you can 
&#62; always use a mage in a divide and conquer scenario, but this isn't 
&#62; really &#34;multi-player&#34; adventuring).  Also, note that this is 
&#62; written from the mage's point of view.  For the most part, the other 
&#62; members of the group are left on the periphery for the purposes of 
&#62; this discussion.  This is not to slight them in any way, I'm simply 
&#62; applying the focus to the mage here.  In fact, I will simply use ROP 
&#62; (Rest of Party) to abbreviate for those adventuring with the mage.  
&#62; Also, the party make-up is assumed to have only one sorcerer.  As 
&#62; some others have stated, I also feel that more than one mage is not 
&#62; only overkill, but also inefficient.
&#62; 
&#62; When you get into any kind of group tactics, all members must be 
&#62; disciplined.  If you start changing strategies without telling your 
&#62; comrades, chaos can ensue.  Therefore, for the following to work, all 
&#62; members must be on the &#34;same page,&#34; and stick to tactics 
&#62; consistently.  Another assumption made below is that mana use is 
&#62; irrelevant.  That is, little consideration is given to how 
&#62; efficiently different strategies will use mana.  So, depending on the 
&#62; mage, one might have to slightly alter one of the strategies, or even 
&#62; abandon it altogether.
&#62; 
&#62; One final caveat is that most of my adventuring is done in hell- 
&#62; particularly hell/hell.  Keep in mind that my point of view tends to 
&#62; be skewed in the direction of strategies that work there.  Of course, 
&#62; the following list is NOT meant to be comprehensive, simply some 
&#62; suggested ways of playing.  With all that in mind, please enjoy.
&#62; 
&#62; 1)  DESCRIPTION:  Stone curse everything and let ROP deal out all 
&#62; damage
&#62;       MARCHING ORDER:  Typically ROP in front with mage behind, but 
&#62; mage can lead on occasion
&#62;      ADVANTAGES:
&#62;        a) Safe for all members of the group.  With no 18th-level 
&#62; Fireballs or Chain flying around, risk of friendly fire is very low.  
&#62; Since most monsters don't move for very long, they will not inflict 
&#62; much damage on the party.
&#62;      DISADVANTAGES:
&#62;        a)  The biggest drawback, of course, is that the mage gets no 
&#62; experience using this method.
&#62;        b)  This method is very tedious for the mage.  You must be 
&#62; very disciplined to use this strategy.  It's really tempting to let 
&#62; loose with Fireball or Chain, but you can't;  keep those spells in 
&#62; your pocket.
&#62;        c)  Sometimes other members in your group will feel guilty 
&#62; because they know you're not getting any XP, and they will be 
&#62; reluctant to stick with this strategy.
&#62; 
&#62;       COMMENTS:
&#62;          This is still the method I prefer, and the method I use the 
&#62; most often (and, thus, it's the one I know the most about).  
&#62; Sometimes I will break the monotony if we come upon a small room and 
&#62; activate some of the monsters by the doorway.  After I've stoned the 
&#62; creatures at the entrance of the room, I'll Teleport inside to the 
&#62; corner of the room and let loose with some Fireballs or Chain.  This 
&#62; is safe since ROP is still outside the room, so there is little 
&#62; chance of friendly fire from the mage hitting them- IF you make sure 
&#62; that you're in the very corner.  You get to let loose a little bit, 
&#62; blow a few things up, and then can regroup and go back to stoning 
&#62; exclusively.  One warning though:  Only Teleport blindly if you have 
&#62; good AC and an item of Harmony.
&#62;           Also, this strategy may not work well for low-level groups 
&#62; since the mage will be limited in the amount of mana he has, and will 
&#62; probably be casting a Stone Curse that is in the 50s for casting 
&#62; cost.  50 versus 40 doesn't sound like much of a difference, but when 
&#62; you add it up over time, it is certainly significant.
&#62;            In a group of only two, this can also be a slow strategy.  
&#62; With only one person to deal out the damage, it may take two or even 
&#62; three stones for some monsters before your companion can finally do 
&#62; away with all of them.  So, this will probably be a little better for 
&#62; groups of 3 or 4.
&#62;           I know what you're thinking:  Aahz, how can you endorse 
&#62; this strategy?  You've listed only one advantage and three 
&#62; disadvantages.  You've admitted that it may be slow, and you'll never 
&#62; level-up doing this.  The answer is easy:  in this case the one 
&#62; advantage outweighs the three disadvantages (for me, anyway).  It's 
&#62; like this:  no one wants to be in the dungeon with a trigger-happy 
&#62; mage.  Once you start throwing some accidental PK's into the mix, 
&#62; nobody will WANT to adventure with you.  After that, you don't need 
&#62; to worry about multi-player tactics anymore:  solo will be all that 
&#62; you need to know.
&#62;           As far as the experience goes, I will always say that if 
&#62; you want XP as a mage, play alone.  It's more efficient when you're 
&#62; by yourself because you can let loose with your spells and fly 
&#62; (literally) through levels.  However, for those of you who want to 
&#62; gain experience with your mage in a group, please read further.     
&#62; 
&#62; 2)  DESCRIPTION:  Sorcerer leads and fires spells at monsters.  Once 
&#62; the monsters get into melee range, he Teleports behind ROP and goes 
&#62; into defensive mode; i.e. Stone Curse and Heal Other.  
&#62;       MARCHING ORDER:  Mage in front of ROP initially, then behind 
&#62; ROP as monsters close in.
&#62;       ADVANTAGES:
&#62;         a)  All members of group get experience
&#62;         b)  As long as party does not prematurely move in front of 
&#62; mage, chance of friendly fire is relatively low
&#62;       DISADVANTAGES:
&#62;         a)  Somewhat risky, since the mage throwing Chain out in 
&#62; front can potentially activate too many monsters at once for the 
&#62; party to handle
&#62;         b)  Requires a lot of judgment by all members of the party.  
&#62; Specifically, the party must get accustomed to the timing of when the 
&#62; mage should retreat and ROP advance.  Anytime you have more than one 
&#62; person trying to make timing judgments, errors are likely to occur.  
&#62; (Particularly when b.net is jumping monsters around on every player's 
&#62; screen).
&#62;         c)  Once a mage gets to a high-enough level, very few 
&#62; monsters ever make it to melee range- thus defeating the purpose of 
&#62; group adventuring.
&#62; 
&#62;       COMMENTS:
&#62;           Overall, this is probably the best strategy for low-level 
&#62; groups.  Everyone gets involved, everyone learns tactics, and you'll 
&#62; get a feel for how the other members of your party play right away.  
&#62; Of course, errors will be made in the beginning, but if you can 
&#62; overcome these all members will benefit relatively equally.
&#62;           You have to be careful with this one, though.  It's very 
&#62; easy to mess up the timing of when the mage is to retreat and ROP to 
&#62; advance.  Also, you have to set aside your ego here if you're the 
&#62; mage.  It's tempting to still be throwing spells as the monsters 
&#62; close in, because you KNOW that just one more click of the mouse will 
&#62; dispatch them.  You have to keep your companions in mind and LAY OFF 
&#62; as the monsters close in; otherwise ROP will have no fun.  
&#62; Additionally, if the mage retreats too soon, the party may be 
&#62; overwhelmed by too many monsters.  It's kind of a delicate balance, 
&#62; and this is why I say that learning the timing can be tricky.  Of 
&#62; course, if you adventure with the same players regularly, your group 
&#62; will get a better idea of the habits of each other, thus facilitating 
&#62; the effectiveness of the group by reducing the number of judgment 
&#62; errors.
&#62;           I like this one since all members get to kill monsters, but 
&#62; since I think it's the hardest one to implement effectively, I tend 
&#62; not to use it.
&#62; 
&#62; 3)  DESCRIPTION:  Division based on monster immunity.  The mage kills 
&#62; all monsters that will fall to his Fireball, but leaves the fire-
&#62; immunes to ROP.
&#62;       MARCHING ORDER:  To reduce likelihood of friendly fire, mage 
&#62; should lead- unless, of course, ALL monsters on a given level are 
&#62; fire-immune.
&#62;       ADVANTAGES:
&#62;         a)  If you play enough games together, XP will be nearly even 
&#62; for all members of party.
&#62;         b)  All members of group get to deal out damage occasionally, 
&#62; increasing the fun.
&#62;       DISADVANTAGES:
&#62;         a)  All members of the group MUST be aware of magic 
&#62; resistances/immunities of ALL monsters they will encounter.  
&#62; INSTANTLY aware.
&#62;         b)  In a single-game setting, the XP distribution may be 
&#62; highly unbalanced.
&#62; 
&#62;       COMMENTS:
&#62;           Obviously, this strategy is only going to work with veteran 
&#62; players.  Even more obvious is the fact that it will primarily only 
&#62; be useful in hell.  I suppose you could make some other arbitrary 
&#62; division in the initial levels of the dungeon where magic immunities 
&#62; are less of a concern, but I think this would be somewhat vague at 
&#62; times.  And whenever you have vagueness, you have hesitation and 
&#62; confusion, and these will potentially lead to PK's and MK's.  The 
&#62; reason I see vagueness as a problem is that you won't be sure what 
&#62; kind of monsters are on a level until you've progressed into that 
&#62; level a little ways.  Additionally, the upper levels have more of a 
&#62; variety of monsters on each level.  So, you might be saying, 
&#62; &#34;I'll take the Goat Archers, you take the Bats.&#34;  But then 
&#62; you turn another corner and some melee Goatmen come charging towards 
&#62; the group.  This could lead to some momentary confusion, and thus 
&#62; could lead to some deaths in the party.
&#62;         Let me expand on the disadvantage that says all players must 
&#62; be instantly aware of the monsters' immunities.  Imagine a mage and 
&#62; warrior in the same group.  The party walks into a room and there are 
&#62; Snow Witches up in a corner.  The warrior immediately steps in front 
&#62; of the mage in his eagerness to slice up the witches.  However, the 
&#62; mage has already targeted the Snow Witches as fire-susceptibles and 
&#62; lets loose with his Fireball.  The poor warrior has now received the 
&#62; brunt of a Fireball right in the back, and you've got an unfortunate, 
&#62; accidental PK.  Bummer.  
&#62;          However, imagine a second scenario.  This time, you walk 
&#62; into a room and several Doom Guards approach.  The mage doesn't use a 
&#62; Fireball since he knows it will be useless (on hell difficulty).  
&#62; However, the warrior doesn't realize this right away, and so hangs 
&#62; back.  NOW you've got a problem, because there are 5 knights on the 
&#62; way to impale the mage.  Several things could happen at this point, 
&#62; but a very dangerous scenario is that  the mage panics and retreats; 
&#62; however, the warrior belatedly realizes he is supposed to step in.  
&#62; And now the WARRIOR  has 5 swords swinging at him and no Stone Curse 
&#62; support.  Bad news in hell/hell.  This is why I feel that all members 
&#62; must be instantly aware of magic immunities.  (Yes, I know that some 
&#62; warriors know magic immunities just as well as their sorcerer 
&#62; buddies.  However, in my experience this is the exception rather than 
&#62; the rule).
&#62;          I have been thinking about this strategy for awhile, but 
&#62; have yet to use it consistently.  I'll be trying it this weekend with 
&#62; Jim-Man!, so I'll let you know how it ends up working out.  I have a 
&#62; feeling that as long as the players are experienced, it should be 
&#62; very effective.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;      Well, those are the three that I'm going to cover in this post.  
&#62; I know that I left out an obvious  one:  The sorcerer kills all 
&#62; things with ranged attacks and leaves the melee monsters to his 
&#62; buddies.  The reason I omitted this strategy is that it becomes 
&#62; pretty much irrelevant if a mage is traveling with rogues.  
&#62; Additionally, it doesn't ever work on level 16 of hell/hell, since 
&#62; the Advocates there are triple-immunes. 
&#62; 
&#62;   Some other general comments on using a sorcerer:
&#62; 
&#62;      I personally have never been a proponent of the Heal Other 
&#62; spell.  In my opinion, it is usually a waste of mana.  The way I see 
&#62; it, when I've played my warrior I have a much better idea of where my 
&#62; hit points are at, and I can hit the potion hotkey at the most 
&#62; opportune time.  A sorcerer standing back and watching my hit points 
&#62; on his screen will not have access to the information as quickly as 
&#62; I, the warrior, do.  Therefore, many of his Heal Other casts are 
&#62; coming after I've already hit the potion button.  This is a waste of 
&#62; mana.  Additionally, if, as the warrior, I'm waiting for the mage to 
&#62; heal me and the spell comes too late, I will see my screen turn red- 
&#62; and I will be much less likely to wait for the spell again in the 
&#62; future.  I'm not saying that it is a totally useless strategy, I just 
&#62; find that, in general, it is inefficient.  (Especially on the higher 
&#62; difficulty levels when monsters are doing mega-damage).
&#62;      I also have never been a proponent of changing around your spell 
&#62; hotkeys when playing in a group- as opposed to their setup when 
&#62; you're playing alone.  In general, this causes confusion and 
&#62; frustration when you cast the wrong spell.  I suppose that there are 
&#62; people who are more coordinated than I am, but I almost NEVER change 
&#62; my hotkey setup.  It is now a reaction for me to switch to the exact 
&#62; spell I want.  I switch between my four spells automatically without 
&#62; giving them a thought.  And I almost never choose the wrong one.  
&#62;      I know that some people will replace Fireball with Firebolt and 
&#62; Chain Lightning with Lightning in multi-player.  I don't even do 
&#62; this.  The problem I have run into in the past is that the rest of my 
&#62; party will die, and the monsters will advance on me.  Now I'm stuck 
&#62; with these lousy low-damage spells while the horde closes in.  I'd 
&#62; just as soon Stone Curse the monsters to keep my friends alive.  
&#62; However, if they do die, I won't be in as much danger of falling to 
&#62; the bad-uns also.
&#62;      Always carry Resurrect scrolls when adventuring with others.  
&#62; Hey, realistically, the occasional PK is going to happen when you're 
&#62; throwing around high-level spells.  Be a good friend and correct your 
&#62; error quickly and conveniently.  Don't make your comrades Restart in 
&#62; Town and then have to enter a portal to get back into the fray.
&#62;      One other tactic that I think gets over-looked is when to Stone 
&#62; Curse.  (Again, apologies, Lok, if you've already covered this).  If 
&#62; you don't want to activate a lot of monsters, let the melee creatures 
&#62; get almost on top of your warrior friends before you Stone them.  
&#62; Obviously, your friends have to put some faith in you, but eventually 
&#62; it will work better.  If you start Stone Cursing as soon as you see 
&#62; the two knights on the edge of your screen, the warriors have to 
&#62; advance to kill them.  This potentially could result in more knights 
&#62; getting activated, or, even worse, witches will start shooting at 
&#62; your warriors from behind the knights.  Now you've got witches firing 
&#62; away at your buddies, but your warriors are in your line of fire.  
&#62; Not a good scenario, particularly in hell/hell.  Try to stay patient 
&#62; and let the knights and vipers come to you.
&#62; 
&#62; Now for some requests on input:
&#62; 
&#62; 1)  First, I'd like to see some replies from other sorcerers.  What 
&#62; do you agree with in this post?  Even better, what do you think is 
&#62; total hogwash?  Let's hear about other strategies you use or which of 
&#62; my disadvantages are really advantages.
&#62; 
&#62; 2)  I'd also like to hear from you prominent warriors and rogues.  
&#62; How do you like your mage friends to play?  What spells do you like 
&#62; to see them cast?  Which spells or tactics make you want to fill them 
&#62; full of arrows or cut off their ear with your sword?
&#62; 
&#62; 3)  I don't want to see any posts saying, &#34;The best way for a 
&#62; mage to play is to use Apocalypse because it doesn't hurt the other 
&#62; players.&#34;  I respectfully request that you gamers who have 255 
&#62; charges of Apoc on your staff refrain from posting replies to this.
&#62; 
&#62; Whoa, it is REALLY late now (for me).  I know this was long, but 
&#62; since Boots and Dizzy were asking for multi-player tactics, I thought 
&#62; I'd better throw one in.  Thanks to all who are still reading at this 
&#62; point.
&#62; 
&#62; Happy adventuring, all,
&#62; 
&#62; Aahz   </pre>
