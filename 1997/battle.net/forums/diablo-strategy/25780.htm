<pre> &#62; Where has everyone found their legit items, church, cats, 
caves, 
 &#62; hell?   Which difficulty level, normal, nightmare, or hell?  I 
am 
 &#62; looking to move up but can't find anything?  how far down in 
those 
 &#62; places down to 15, 16?
 &#62;
 &#62; Asylum

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

 I have played literally hundreds of games. I have tried all chars 
 types, levels etc. trying to determine if there is any order to the 
 generation of items.

 Basically, I have found really NO difference between items found in 
 Normal, Nightmare or Hell modes. Good stuff usually begins in the 
 caves (I have found 4 windforce bows there and no place else). The 
 best place to get items is definitely level 15 in hell. The reason 
is 
 that there are at least 4 boss's and sometimes 5 on that level. This 
 really ups your chances to find something.

 More than anything else that will effect dropped items is your level 
 and stats. Once you hit around level 38 things start happening 
 quickly. Wirt begins showing you Godly stuff, which by the way, is 
 the ONLY place you will ever have a chance of finding Godly Plate. I 
 have never heard of someone finding from a creature, but I have 
 bought a Godly Helm of Whale from Wirt, so it does exist legally. 
 Wirt also seems to offer Level 38+ warriors more Godly Whale items 
 than the other char types (just as the witch seems to favor a Rogue 
 for cool staffs... go figure).

 Once last thing, pay close attention to this: On my level 44 rogue, 
 the other day a moron used a cauldron and dropped all my stats by 1. 
 Since that game, (I haven't topped off the stats yet), but I have 
 been finding Unique's all over the place! Even normal creatures are 
 dropping unique stuff! In the 3 games since my stats were lowered by 
 1, I have found: Demonspike plate, 2 thinkingcaps, Dreamflange, 
 Eaglehorn, Stormshield, Kings Saber of Haste, Knights Axe of Vampire 
 and a Blessed Crown of Lion. Not too bad for 3 games eh?

 Oh, one more thing, while I play legit most always, I did hack up 
 some chars running experiments on item drops. I was using a Rogue 
the 
 other day with over 1600 mana points due to some tweaked rings, I 
had 
 SEVERAL Dragons items dropped!!!!! 2 Dragon's rings, Dragon's Amulet 
 it was cool! It seemed that the game more often than not, gives you 
items
less than what you already have. Because I had +4000 mana point 
rings, 
the game gave me a mana ring lower than what I already had (which 
happened to be the rare Dragons items).

 So use this info as you will. As a programmer I can say, it all 
comes 
 down to the random seed. The seed is generated from several factors 
 taken from your char. I firmly believe that things are not totally 
 &#34;random&#34;. This research was compiled by me in efforts to 
 maximize my own findings. I believe this is very accurate of what 
you 
 can expect in the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------

&#62; Playing normal/hell I tend to find rings/amulets with ONLY a prefix 
&#62; OR a suffix.  
&#62; 
&#62; Playing nightmare/hell I tend to find rings/amulets SOMETIMES with a 
&#62; prefix AND suffix.  However, ONE or BOTH of the properties is not the 
&#62; maximum. For instance, I found a DRAGONS (+60) ring of Sorcery (+19). 
&#62; (The best ring of this type you could get is a DRAGONS ring of 
&#62; WIZARDRY).
&#62; 
&#62; Playing in hell/hell tends to maximize the chances of finding 
&#62; rings/amulets with BOTH a BEST PREFIX and BEST SUFFIX.  For instance, 
&#62; I found an Obsidian ring of Harmony in Hell/Hell.  Although you will 
&#62; not ALWAYS get a good prefix and suffix, the chances seem to be 
&#62; maximized.
&#62; 
&#62; Although these are generalities (you WILL find exceptions), I believe 
&#62; that this type of randomness with the prefixes/suffixes also applies 
&#62; to other items.  i.e. Armor, sheilds, helms, bows, etc.
&#62; 
&#62; for what its worth;
&#62; 
&#62; Artemis II

Thanks everyone for the compliments. I also enjoyed the input of 
Artemis here. He is probably right, but I regularly find rings with a 
prefix and suffix in normal games  (one of the last rings I found in 
normal Hell was an Obsidian Ring of Tiger :). I will pay more 
attention to this in the future and give another update.

Added Note: I have, since receiving the message from Artemis here,
experimented with finding both Prefix and Postfix items in Normal, 
Nightmare
and Hell modes of Diablo. Although I will continue with further 
testing,
I have found that there is only a 15&#37; increase in the odds of 
finding an 
item with Prefix and Postfix when playing Hell mode games over Normal
mode games.

Personally, I believe there is little difference in items found from 
Normal 
and Hell mode games. With more testing I believe this will be the 
case but for 
the moment, Artemis's claim does seem to hold. Stay tuned for more 
results.

PS: I will post this message from time to time to aid people in their 
quest
      to better their characters.</pre>
