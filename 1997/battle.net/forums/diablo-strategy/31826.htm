<pre>  Diz (and whomever else feels like reading)
  I have to agree.  (just put that subject in to get your attention!)
                       ;-}

I have yet to read the rest of Code's survey, and his conclusions, but
what I think is, the most important thing you can do is DEFINE 
CHEATING!!!  Not just cheating in Diablo, but cheating in general.  
Is cheating simply &#34;breaking the rules,&#34; or is it &#34;doing 
something (anything!) that gives you an unfair advantage,&#34; or 
what??  Once you 
decide that, most acts will surely fall clearly into 
&#34;cheating&#34; or
&#34;legit.&#34;  The only thing that should change that is a 
change/update to
your def. of cheating.  Will you define cheating as a purely 
&#34;legal&#34; issue, or will you attatch moral connotations?  If 
you attatch particularly high morals to your def, then certain things 
that are
perfectly within the &#34;rules&#34; of Diablo will clearly be 
cheating (perhaps accepting powerful, legit, items from higher level 
characters).

&#62; Are these people looking for others
&#62; to justify their quasi-moral actions?
  This, my friend, is an excellent question!!  You should decide, BY 
YOURSELF, if you can live with your decision to do X or Y and still
call yourself legit.  If you can, who gives a flying frigg what anyone
else says?  You can ALWAYS find SOMEONE who will say &#34;sure, 
that's ok
to do--I do it all the time!&#34;  Does that make it ok for you????
&#62; 
&#62; I think most people want to be considered &#34;legit&#34;.
&#62; But now the question is raised about what exactly
&#62; does  &#34;legit&#34; mean.
  
   Amen--see above.
&#62; 
&#62;
&#62; So in answer to the newbie question &#34;Is this cheating?&#34;,
&#62; it is, if you think it is. If you feel bad about doing it
&#62; then some part of you does believe it is cheating.
   It may not be &#34;breaking the rules,&#34; but it sure might be 
cheating!

If I may, let me give you an example.  Last night, I (finally!!) got
to play with DarkSniper and Aahz.  I was level 28; DS was 38 (I think-
give or take 1) and Aahz was 45.  I have no doubt that both characters
were legit (meaning, they didn't modify stats/xp, dupe, hack, etc.)
We went into Nightmare/hell.  Now, I, as a 28th level, would NEVER 
have done this with a group of chars. of comparable level to me.
Aahz stoned nearly everything in site (Aahz, you've gotta work on 
that--some things were moving from time to time!!  ;-} ), and DS and
me shot the sh_t out of anything that moved/didn't move.  Out of the 
whole experience, I got a number of magic elixers, a level up, a 
couple of improvements for magic itmes (includig Gotterdam.), and my 
second dot.  I COULD have gotten most of this on my own, eventually,
but I just got it all much faster with the help of DS and Aahz.  Was
this cheating?  Well, from a technical, &#34;legal&#34; standpoint, 
no.  I could have ventured into that level myself, visited Adria 
enough times
to buy my own elixers, and killed enough to level up myself.  Morally,
was it cheating?  I'm not so sure.  I don't think I'll adventure again
with level disparities that great, though.  (don't get me wrong--it
was fun, and I was in danger more that once--I came close to death 
a number of times, and Diablo did kill me once --so did DS!!  dam 
Windforce . . .)  But, I felt much more secure than I would have had
I been travelling with lower level characters, and surely would not 
have gotten the ol' second dot without them.

  My point is the same as Dizzy's--YOU have to define cheating for 
YOU, and find players who feel the same way.  Maybe me and DS/Aahz
will have a private discussion about cheating some time, and they can
convince me one way or the other that last night's game was 100&#37; 
legit.  Until then,

Do only what you think is right!!!!
