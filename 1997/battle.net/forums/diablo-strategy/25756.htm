<pre>&#62; begins to speak  demos who are looking for 3 brothers , now this is my
&#62; question . Who are those 3 brothers?????

The demons aren't looking for three brothers, the demons ARE the 
three brothers:  Diablo (ahem), Baal (pronounced like bail or bale), 
and Mephisto (at least I'm pretty sure that's the last guy's name).  
In actuality, they are all pretty much different names for Satan. 
(ain't multicultural mythology fun?  : )


&#62; Question 2:
&#62; Is this right to assume that, I = lazarus, the archbishop
&#62; and my master = diablo ??????

I was never sure if it was supposed to be Lazarus, but it could be.  
I don't pay much attention to those books anymore.  But yeah, the 
master in question is Diablo. (that's why he says &#34;my lord AND 
master&#34;)


&#62; Final question, and i will be very happy if you would answer this 
&#62; one, at
&#62; the end when you defeat diablo, you get a short movie, it says but 
&#62; still
&#62; you feel him clawinghis way up from the dark way of the receses of 
&#62; your
&#62; soul. Is diablo2 , or something else coming from blizzard?????


Well now of course they want to leave themselves an opening if they 
want to make a sequel.  But at this time, according to at least one 
source at Blizzard, they are not working on Diablo 2 at this time.  
Their main focus is getting Starcraft finished, then working on that 
new Warcraft game (NOT Warcraft 3).  See the reviews in or on the PC 
Gamer site.
