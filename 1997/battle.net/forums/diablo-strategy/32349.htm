<blockquote>
<pre>This subject aptly describes my adventures last night.

&#34;So, did the great knight Dizzy set forth across the lands of
battle.net. His quest, given him by God himself, was to
find Windforce!&#34;

I was doing this because my friend and I were playing
Diablo at my house on an IPX network when he found
Windforce in Nightmare/Caves. But he lost it the same
night to a computer glitch. He was also the one that
suggested I post this little tale of my adventure to find
a replacement for him.

&#34;At first, Dizzy was easily distracted by the wonders he saw.
He accomplished many a heroic and noble deed (having
nothing to do with Windforce) while on his quest.&#34;

I went adventuring with various different groups. I went up
a level and collected some items for myself and some to
give to my other characters.

I finally buckled down after fooling around. The first place
I went was the Trading Post. After screaming my head off
for a while with lines like &#34;Does anybody have WINDFORCE
they are willing to trade?&#34; and being ignored, someone
finally replied. This guy had Windforce and we got into the 
negotiation for what to trade it for. After the negotiations
proceeded for a while, the guy send to me &#34;Oh, BTW, it's
duped. Does that matter to you?&#34; DOH!

&#34;So did Dizzy's first clue fail to lead him to Windforce, but
the stuart knight was persistent.&#34;

I visited the many chatrooms, asking for Windforce, but nobody
had a non-duped version. At this point I stopped playing to
get a snack.

&#34;In the frozen lands of Nador, they were forced to eat
Sir Robin's minstrels.... and there was much rejoicing.
(yeah)&#34;

So, I decided to start joining public games that either said
something about trading or no-cheating/no-dupping.

&#34;It's not the real Grail?&#34;

The first one I joined was one about trading. The town
square was littered with stuff! I commented &#34;looks like a
yard sale&#34;. The people in that game said I could have
anything I wanted, just take it. There was GPOW, Obsi Ring
of Zodiac, all this ridiculous stuff. Not to mention I kept
getting error messages from the game about &#34;duplicate
item detected&#34; and &#34;so-and-so attempted casting an illegal
spell&#34;. Considering one guy was running around dropping
items everywhere, and also considering those errors, I
figured I had arrived in duper central. I was outta there like
a bad habit.

&#34;We have ridden since the snows of winter covered the
land, through the Kingdom of Mercia...&#34;

Most of the rest of the games I popped into, I would ask
&#34;Has anybody got Windforce, and willing to trade it?&#34;. If
they said &#34;no&#34;, I would thank them and find another game.
And most did say &#34;no&#34;.

&#34;You can't expect to wield SUPREME executive power, just
'cuz some watery tart threw a Windforce at you!&#34;

One group in a game called &#34;Legit Trading&#34; or something
like that responded to my question with &#34;Nobody has
Windforce for real, they are all duped, you can't find it&#34;.
I proceeded to argue with them for a while that I actually
saw my friend find it, and it was real, and we had found it
before we even knew it was possible to hack/dupe items.
I explained that he lost it to a computer glitch. They finally
believed me, and were sympathetic to my friend's  plight,
but they had no Windforces to trade (obviously!).

&#34;You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest, with...
a herring!&#34;

As the night wore on, the weirdoes started to come out. At
first, most of the people I met were decent folk. Later at
night they were either freaky, scary, or just plain jerks.

&#34;I wave my private parts at your aunties, you tiny brained
wipers of other people's bottoms!&#34;

One group I walked in on wasn't in town. There was a town
portal though. I asked the three characters in the game my
standard question. One of them claimed to have a legit
Windforce. &#34;Will you trade it?&#34; I asked. &#34;Come down the
portal and we'll talk&#34; said he. This sounded suspicious, so I
said &#34;I would prefer to trade in town.&#34;, to which he replied
&#34;I'm in the middle of something, just come down&#34;. To which
I said &#34;My mother told me never to use strange portals&#34;.
After a pause, he said &#34;Well, I'm not going to inconvenience
myself for you!&#34;. So I said &#34;Fine&#34; and was preparing to 
leave.
But then one of the other characters sent the message
&#34;I'm dead&#34;. Then the other two began pleading with me to
bring down a res scroll for their friend. This sounded REALLY
suspicious, because they seemed to want me down in that
dungeon real bad. But I couldn't pass up a cry for help, so I
bought a res scroll. But before going down, I dropped all my
gold in a secludedd part of town, and put all my equipped
items into my backpack. I went down through the portal,
and sure enough, I was  instantly attacked and killed. I
sent to them &#34;Damn! You guys are just too cool! You really
fooled me!&#34;, restarted in town, got my gold, and left these
blow-boys and their game.

&#34;No! Now, go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!&#34;

One game I was in, some guy (BTW: I am purposely leaving
out the names of the characters I met, so as to protect the
innocent. This way, I am the only one who can get flamed
or spammed!) just kept following right behind me wherever
I went. This got old really fast, so I left that game, so I left that
game. That guy was some sort of psycho, because he followed
me in the chat rooms for a while until I squelched him.

&#34;Perhaps if we built this large wooden badger...&#34;

One game I went into, I asked my question, and some guy told
me he has a legit Windforce. He was standing, in town, next to
some other character, a friend of his I assume. I tell him I am
willing to trade my KSOB for it. He says &#34;Let me see it!&#34; and
both of those characters run right up next to me. I say &#34;Let me
see Windforce!&#34;. He says &#34;You first&#34;. I say &#34;Alright, 
but back
away from me, and I'll drop it on the ground. That way you
can see I really have it.&#34; They back up like one square. 
&#34;More&#34; I said. They back up two/three. &#34;More&#34; I say. 
They
finally get to a decent distance, and so I dropped the sword
on the ground, so they can see what I'm talking about is real.
The INSTANT the sword hits the ground, both of their
characters are moving right at me! I pick up the sword
immediately. They complain, &#34;I didn't see it&#34;.
&#34;Don't pick it up!&#34; I say. They say &#34;Wasn't going 
to&#34;. So they
back up again. I drop it again. They rush in, but I pick it up
again before they can get to it. This goes on another two
times before I finally get tired of this game. Fortunately I
was able to retain the sword every time. &#34;Let me see the
bow!&#34; I say. To which the first guy says &#34;I've decided to keep
it after all&#34;. Obviously, he never had it, he just wanted to
steal my stuff. &#34;You suck&#34;, I reply, and left those wank-heads
to wallow in their cheeziness.

&#34;But finally, Dizzy's quest came to an end!&#34;

In desperation I joined this game that said &#34;Will trade for
books&#34;. Didn't sound too promising, but I was getting
desperate. There is one guy here, a wizard sitting in town.
He immediately asks &#34;do you have any books?&#34;. Actually,
I did have this book of Bloodstar that I found and was planning
to give to my wizard character. I told him about this. He got all
excited &#34;Maybe I have something you want for it? I have
some good items I've picked up lately&#34;. I told him I was only
looking for Windforce, &#34;Do you have it?&#34;. &#34;Yep!&#34;. I 
asked if
it was legit and he replied, rather honestly, he wasn't 100&#37;
sure, but he thought it was. He proceeded to tell me the
story of how earlier in the evening he was playing a game,
and this rogue in the game kept sniping the other characters
in the middle of the fight, and then saying &#34;Sorry&#34;. But it
became a little too frequent to be believable. So the
wizard went down into hell, found a huge room full of
monsters and put a TP right in the middle. Then tricked
said rogue into going into his portal, and the monsters
killed the rogue. So he then cleaned out the room and got
all the rogue's stuff. The rogue's bow turned out to be
Windforce. &#34;Was the rogue a cheater?&#34; I asked. &#34;No, just
a jerk&#34; replied the guy. He didn't think the rogue was
cheating because she died fairly quickly in that trap he set,
and the rest of her stuff wasn't that great. He said
&#34;Cheaters usually have Zodiac/Godly/Obsidian everything.&#34;

So I traded my book of Bloodstar for Windforce. A rather
lopsided deal, from my point of view, but the guy seemed
happy. I guess, what's a wizard going to do with Windforce
anyway?

That is the end of my tale.
