You can also use TK to open a trapped door or chest from
the safety of another room.  This used to be real important
as a rogue because the disarm skill didn't work worth crap,
and with fewer hit points than warriors or mages with mana
shield, the rogue was the only char really at risk of dying from
the stupid traps.  I know, I died twice trying to disarm traps
when I was over 20th level and had a full life bubble.  Since
then I would NEVER open a trapped chest with anything 
but TK from behind a wall.

V1.04 had a note mentioning the rogue's disarm skill was 
fixed so I've been trying that again.  So far, I am much
happier with her ability to disarm, so maybe it really is 
fixed.  And although I do still get nailed once in a while,
it has never been for more than 50 points or so.
