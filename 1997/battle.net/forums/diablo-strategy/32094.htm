<pre>Code, great post,

I just wanted to post the following comments.  I bet you didn't even 
read my post at the bottom of the page, and you still answered my 
questions!  :)

&#62; What happened you asked? I got my A** Kicked!!!! I was overcome in a 
&#62; blink of an eye and found myself back in town. 

Thats what happened to me too!!  I stated this EXACT phrase in my 
post about the level 18 warrior who got his 3rd dot without cheating 
(at the bottom of this page).

&#62; As nothing moved when I got close, I was able to &#34;practice&#34; 
&#62; my Stone Curse and Arrow aiming. I have heard TONZ of people give 
&#62; their ideas on where to &#34;aim&#34; to increase your chances of 
&#62; hitting a creature... you know what?? They are all WRONG! I can now 
&#62; stone ANY single char out of a huge group each and every time. It was 
&#62; staggering to me to know in all this time, I had been aiming 
&#62; incorrectly. 
&#62; 

I have also been getting quite good at stoning individual monsters in 
a group.  I wouldn't say I have a 100&#37; success rate, but I have 
about a 90&#37; or 95&#37; success rate.  I'd be interested in 
hearing your views.  I seem to find that stoning one monster, then 
moving the cursor quite aways away before moving it back to stone the 
next monster adjacent to the first monster really works well.  I 
haven't really consciously thought about it, it just works naturally 
for me now.

&#62; I learned something else staggering to me, as I used Windforce, a bow 
&#62; with Knockback, sometimes stray arrows would activate hellspawn off 
&#62; of the screen. Their AI tells them to come directly to me, regardless 
&#62; if they can see me or not. They would approach until they reached my 
&#62; &#34;light radius&#34; and would crouch down to fire. 1 shot from 
&#62; them would &#34;confuse&#34; them and they would wander back and 
&#62; forth across the light radius threshold. I found I could activate 
&#62; lots of hell spawn and only shoot them when they crouched down to 
&#62; fire. Hit them once and it would take them 4-5 sec to crouch back 
&#62; down, and give me time to kill others. It was easy! Also, I noticed 
&#62; that if I teleported only a few &#34;squares&#34; away, enough that 
&#62; my light radius did not hit them, they would instantly &#34;loose 
&#62; me&#34; even though I was still near them. I never had to retreat 
&#62; far, only a few squares!

This is interesting, I'll have to try it.

 You *HAVE* to be wearing the darkness 
&#62; rings when you ENTER the level! 

AAAAHHHHHH!!!!! So thats the answer.  I didn't have too much time to 
fool around with my darkness stunt either because my wife came home, 
and I had to finish some 'honey-do's'.  You know, 'honey-do-this' or 
'honey-do-that'.  I'm glad you figured this out and posted it!!!  
Great!!!

&#62; Comments?
