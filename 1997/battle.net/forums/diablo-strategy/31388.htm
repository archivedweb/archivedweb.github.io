&#62; &#62; The reason people on here hate cheating is because people who use 
&#62; &#62; trainers and hack progs tend to roam battle.net with invincible 
&#62; &#62; characters to kill players.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The point:  It's only cheating if it feels like cheating or you're 
&#62; &#62; hurting someone else.  Otherwise, just have fun with it!

&#62; 
&#62; So true! Too many people are caught up in this &#34;legit&#34; thing 
&#62; and are placing more value in it than in just having fun. I thought 
&#62; of something this weekend and will be posting it later today. Look 
&#62; for a &#34;big&#34; post from me later today (should make alot of 
&#62; people think).
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway as far as cheating and Pking goes... I would rather play in a 
&#62; game were everyone is a cheater, than to be in a game with a single 
&#62; PK legit or not.
&#62; 
&#62;

I agree with both points here.  I'd like to add one thing, tho.  I was
on battlenet last night.  I was joined by a guy--level 28 fighter, 
2,000 hit points.  He said he &#34;cheated to help others against 
PK's&#34;.
He was a nice guy-res. me when he hit me w/ a stray cl (twice-
dough!!), but also dropped a GPOW for me to take.  And, he went
ahead, killing about 80&#37; of the baddies in hell!!

Now, like I said, I think that's nice in it's own way.  But, I came
on bn to PLAY Diablo, not to watch someone just obliterate everything
in site!!  He (BigD) was definitely trying to help me out, but I 
didn't have all that much fun.  So, was he cheating?  He'd probably
say no, but I'd say yes.

I don't really have a point, but just thought I'd throw that out 
there.

Later,
Boots

PS--Merlyn--if you read this, I hope your dinner wasnt' too badly 
burned!!  We'll have to play a private game sometime, and see what
we can do-you seemed both cool AND  legit!!
BigD--don't think I don't like you, 'cause you are cool.  Keep on
fightin the good fight, man!!!</pre>
