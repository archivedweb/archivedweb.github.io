<pre>In short, the referenced post is a statement by PatN that GPOW does 
exist in V1.04 but is extremely rare.  Unfortunately, it doesn't 
clarify whether that plate is breast plate, gothic plate, or full 
plate.  I myself have been offered Godly (Breast) Plate of the Whale 
by Wirt, but I didn't buy it because it wasn't better than my Awesome 
Plate (perhaps I should have just as a curio!).  Interestingly, it 
was the third or fourth (but best) Godly item that Wirt offered me 
that night.  (Haven't seen a Godly item since, though.)

&#62; &#62;  Maybe I'm just seeing the glass as half empty here, but I think this 
&#62; &#62; whole Godly does not exist speil everyone has been spouting here is a 
&#62; &#62; bunch of crap.  
&#62; &#62;  First of all, whoever said that Godly plate (with no other info-just 
&#62; &#62; Godly plate of any sort) does not exist for real is either severly 
&#62; &#62; lacking in playing time to make such a statement or a liar.  I have 
&#62; &#62; been offered Godly Breast plate from Wirt on a couple of occasions, 
&#62; &#62; and once it was of the Whale (I was thinking of buying it just as a 
&#62; &#62; trophy, but didn't have the cash-it was like 110-120k).  
&#62; &#62;  As for it only existing in Single player, I find that ridiculous.  
&#62; &#62; If anything, it should be offered only in MULTI player.  Anyone who's 
&#62; &#62; played single player knows that if you had godly plate, even Field 
&#62; &#62; plate, you'd be almost invincible to anything in single.  Since it 
&#62; &#62; does exist there though (so I've heard...not that lucky when I played 
&#62; &#62; through), it is obviously going to be easier to get (I found awesome 
&#62; &#62; gothic on an armor stand at level 22 with my s.p. sorcerer), so it 
&#62; &#62; makes sense that it's been seen there, but that doesn't mean that it 
&#62; &#62; doesn't exist in multi as well.
&#62; &#62;  A friend of mine whom I play with on modem occasionally, and who 
&#62; &#62; actually introduced me to Diablo when he showed me the pre-release 
&#62; &#62; demo back in November, and who accquired the game around the same 
&#62; &#62; time I did (early January), told me that he FOUND Godly full plate in 
&#62; &#62; a barrel in hell.  I know what you're thinking, in a barrel?!?!? Yeah 
&#62; &#62; right!  
&#62; &#62;  This individual is a very reliable source, and this incident 
&#62; &#62; supposedly occured at a time before it was possible for some ghost to 
&#62; &#62; drop the item from thin air.  I personally am slightly skeptical, but 
&#62; &#62; do tend to believe that this did happen.
&#62; &#62;  Holy items are another controversy here, it seems.  In my Diablo 
&#62; &#62; career, and it's been a long one, I have seen about 20 items with the 
&#62; &#62; holy prefix, and most of them have been crapola.  Two days ago 
&#62; &#62; (Tuesday) one of my wizards was able to buy a Holy Gothic Shield of 
&#62; &#62; the Ages, AC 18, +167&#37; from Wirt for about 60k (he also got 
&#62; &#62; offered Awesome Full Plate from gris-AC 74 +143&#37; His AC is now 
&#62; &#62; 290!).  I also bought a friend a Holy Crown I saw a while back.  
&#62; &#62; Anyway, it seems to me that Holy items are actually more rare than 
&#62; &#62; Godly ones, but this may just be a fluke.
