<pre>I have to agree with John on this doorway/opening  tactic:

&#62; Both rogues fire 
&#62; into the room, crossing streams to set up a kill zone.  The mage is 
&#62; optional :), but he can stand there and fireball monsters that are 
&#62; stunned by the arrows or get through.  He can also stone if you have 
&#62; to beat a hasty retreat.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; I don't think a warrior would fit in well here, because arrows flew
&#62; &#62; in every direction, almost constantly.  Too much possibility of
&#62; &#62; friendly fire.  
&#62;

&#62;        @    @ &#60;--- rogues
&#62; 
&#62;           @ &#60;--- mage


But when loaded with demons they tend to wander around on the 
opposite side of the wall from where the rouges are located, 
sometimes out of your parties line of site (! on my map)  So I like 
to have the mage cast a firewall spell just inside of the doorway to 
take care of the wanders.

     In my opinion the best 3 player game for nightmare/hell and some 
hell/hell is 2  rouges and a warrior.  Two lvl 30 rogues could do a 
pretty good job when compared to a lvl 25 mage.  When it came down to 
having a warrior or a mage in this 3 person group the warrior won 
because of one simple fact, I feel alot safer when I have a warrior 
that I can retreat behind when things get too hot, i.e. Hords of Doom 
Knights, Blood Knights and the like.  Sorry mages :)

    As for a 4 player game (same types as above) I DON'T like 2 
Rouges, 1 mage, 1 warrior  Because of the awesome destruction caused 
by arrows and magic it is harder for the warrior to become involved 
since he is not a ranged attacker.  When he does become involved it 
hinders the others from their full potential.

    As for whit I LIKE (same types as above) I am torn between;
a) 3 Rouges, 1mage
Great combo for harder levels. The amount of arrows here is         
increadible and with a mage to boot well.... need I say more?

b) 2 Rouges, 2mages
This I think is also a good choice, great amount of arrows and        
 plentiful amounts of magic, especially Stone Curse and Golem.

c) 1 Rogue, 1 mage, 2 warriors
I think this is the best all around combo.  With only 2 ranged        
 attackers the warriors can move about more freely and thus         
become more involved. It is eaiser for the rogue to adjust her        
     shots around the warrior than it is for the warrior to move 
around          her true/stray shots.  Why? Because the arrows travel 
faster,             than the warrior can move.  It is hard to fight & 
dodge arrows at the      same time.

&#62; That has me wondering just how useful weird/strange bows are in 
&#62; multiplayer.  The warrior's AC is probably much higher than the 
&#62; monsters' AC.  I'm not exactly sure how AC and hit&#37; interrelate, 
&#62; but it's definitely not linear, so you should be able to adjust your 
&#62; hit&#37; to where you only occasionally hit the warrior, but usually 
&#62; hit the monsters.  Maybe a bow with a -hit&#37;?

Good idea but the draw-backs I see are;
a) with a lower &#37;to hit we rouges have more stray arrows.

b) Higher weapon repair bills from plucking the bow more.

c) We would be less help in a game because we would not be able     
to hit as much.


Just remember without patience, teamwork goes down the drain.

    And one more thing for our newbie multi game players (if any even 
read this stuff), DON'T step in front of a rouges bow.....please.  
Even if we are walking don't cross our path unexpectedily, you never 
know when an arrow might be coming out.

    Level 34 Rouge
