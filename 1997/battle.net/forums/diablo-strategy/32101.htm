&#62; The basic premis I used was this: Creatures get &#34;activated&#34; 
&#62; by the &#34;light&#34; casted out by your player. The larger the 
&#62; light radius casted by your player, the more creatures you can 
&#62; activate as you move. By using Rings of Darkness, I wanted to make my 
&#62; light radius as small as possible and hence allowing me to get closer 
&#62; to creatures without activating them.  
&#62; 
&#62; With two rings of Darkness in my inventory, I dumped all my armor and 
&#62; spare items in town, loaded up on mana and headed to hell. When I got 
&#62; down, I put on the rings and WOW did it get *DARK*! It was really 
&#62; errie. I used one of a million Infra scrolls I had and started off 
&#62; slowly. The level contained Doom Guards and Lava Maw's. I had 
&#62; intended on getting close to a creature, stoning them and shooting 
&#62; them with my bow.
&#62;
&#62; If a level 1 player was carefull with stray arrows, he could easily 
&#62; clear hell hell alone with no armor. It's facinating yet sorta 
&#62; depressing. Throw away your armor folks, you don't need it. You only 
&#62; need 2 rings of Darkness which only cost 1 gold piece a piece.
&#62; 
&#62; Comments?

&#62; PS: DAMN I know alot about this game

I am not trying to say that you are wrong, but here is my experience
with rings of light.  In the &#34;beta&#34; demo you could load up on
items that increase your light radius and they would add to each 
other.
I had so much light radius that the game could not handle it and the 
color
mapping would go haywire.  It was pretty cool.

I tried this in the registered version with 1 ring of +20&#37; light 
radius
and 1 ring of +40&#37; light radius.  This did not do anything.  I 
got the
+40&#37; light radius and that is all.  I am not sure if rings of 
dark do
the same, but I assume they would.  I do not see how 2 rings of dark,
or whatever, will do anything different that 1 ring of dark.

Oh yeah, and I have entered hell and those bat-winged women start 
shooting
before I can ever see them.  Now I know that my light radius is not 
triggering
them because they are too far away.  Go fig...
