&#62; &#62; Alright, all you gullible fools, I'm going to tell you why this guy 
&#62; &#62; is a liar and a cheat.
&#62; &#62; Here are the facts.
&#62; &#62; 1.) He says he is wearing Gotterdamnerung
&#62; &#62; 2.) Gotterdamnerung requires 50 strength.
&#62; &#62; 3.) His base strength is 30.
&#62; &#62; 4) He says his strength is at 56 with items on.
&#62; &#62; 5.) The only items he is wearing that add to strength are a ring of 
&#62; &#62; strength which gives +1 to +5 to strength, and a split skull shield 
&#62; &#62; which gives +2 to strength, which gives him a maximum addition of +7 
&#62; &#62; to strength, giving him a maximum of 37 strength.
&#62; &#62;
&#62; Hey now,
&#62; 
&#62; Actually he could equip the big G, here's how:
&#62; Wear a Ring of the Giants/Titans/Heavens/whatever to boost str &#62;50
&#62; Put on big G.
&#62; Take off the str boosting ring
&#62; The boosts from G keeps his str over 50, so he can continue to wear 
&#62; it.  If he takes it off, however, he must re-equip the str boosting 
&#62; ring.
&#62; Now I'm not saying he's lying, speaking the truth, or whatever.  Just 
&#62; that he could equip Gotter if he had another str boosting piece of 
&#62; equipment, which he would unequip later.  Why he would do this I have 
&#62; no idea -- maybe to make it more challenging.  
&#62; 
&#62; Binkley

Yes, I suppose that is possible.  I used to do that with my rogue 
when using demonspike coat, because it adds to strength.  I would use 
a ring of giants to put it on, then after it was on I had the 
addition to strength and didn't need it anymore, so I equipped a 
better ring.  Although if he did that, I failed to understand why he 
would take off the ring of giants and put on a ring of strength.  If 
he really wanted to make it more challenging, then why was he using a 
king's sword of haste?  Seems like he was using a double-standard to 
me.  It's ok to use the best sword, but not a good ring.  Another 
reason the story is not believable.  But I suppose this fact does 
make it somewhat more believeable.  Maybe I'll give it a try, but I 
wonder if I'll ever be able to find gotterdamnerung.  And hey, why 
bother with it anyway, just dupe the ring of darkness (night?), and 
you've got your -80&#37; light radius.</pre>
