&#62; hi,
&#62; 
&#62; My rogue was recently PK'd for the first time *mumble mumble* I was 
&#62; using eaglehorn, you see.  This pk (he was a mage) started casting a 
&#62; firewall in between him and me. And although he persisted he wasn't 
&#62; using god mode (and this was true as later on a friend had his ear)
&#62; He wouldn't die. I was hitting him nearly everytime. He wasn't using 
&#62; mana shield either. Is this because eagle horns  damage sux??? I was 
&#62; using a amulet of radiance and a ring of the eagle. 

A level 14 rogue with eaglehorn?  Man, as a hacker and a cheater (and 
one time legit) *I'm* telling you to toss it all and play straight.  
But for your info, you're either not doing enough damage or your hit 
percentage is pathetic (depending on who this pk was).
 
&#62; If that is the case. What bow would be the best. I have 45 str and 
&#62; can boost it up to 70 when using an amulet of the titans.  What would 
&#62; the best bow I should be looking for on the trading post?

Like I said, earn the items. Do NOT (man I'm growing soft and senile) 
go to the trading post! Find your items.  Strange bow (of lightning 
or perfection) = best hit percentage (pin down enemy).  Windforce = 
best damage.  Use former against high ac, latter against powerful 
magic.
 
&#62; Also, what do you do when you are playing as a mage and the creatur 
&#62; is immune to fire?? I have lvl 9 fireball but only level 4 lightning. 
&#62; and chain lightning eats up my mana (around 200) really quick. I'm 
&#62; currently using a lightning staff of fireball and using that it takes 
&#62; for ever to kill one. so by the time I've killed two my mana shield 
&#62; is down and it's all over. 
&#62; 
&#62; Please anyone (particularly high level rogues and mages) help,

Go play on a lower level.  If not, go find some books of lightning or 
use a fighter-mage setup (sword and shield).
 
&#62; Mystery 
&#62; level 14 rogue.

Don't ruin the game for yourself.  Play legit (no dupes or trading) 
then cheat.  Makes it way more fun.
