&#62; &#62; first thing i d like to apologize to all who has supported me, and

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; to lorax...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; lorax, lorax, lorax. when will u get my point? ok i get ur point 
&#62; &#62; already. if u read my reply, i do admit i was rude. ur point is that 
&#62; &#62; im rude rite? if not put ur point in where it saids subject. and my 
&#62; &#62; point is, if he gets this clan going, he ll have a great chance that 
&#62; &#62; the clan will screw up. now this desn't effect me. but think about 
&#62; &#62; all the little members in his clan? how would they feel? im telling 
&#62; &#62; him to quit cos i dont want him to create a clan thats full of 
&#62; &#62; cheaters (cos he cant even determine which one is cheater), therefore 
&#62; &#62; increasing the number of cheaters in the clan. if u read my post, u 
&#62; &#62; know i hate cheaters and im sure u do too. now my philosiphy is to 
&#62; &#62; stop cheating as much as possible. and to stop it, we should tell 
&#62; &#62; beginners about it before the cheats ruin the game for them. now 
&#62; &#62; would u agree with me?

&#62; &#62; DarkSniper
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; DarkSniper,
&#62; 
&#62; Ok.  This whole thread is really frustrating the bejeezes out of me, 
&#62; thus this is the absolute last time I will respond, so pay attention 
&#62; and read carefully. The point isn't in the subject line, like you 
&#62; suggested, but I'll try to make it clear enough for you.
&#62; 
&#62; How many times do I have to say this?  (At least three evidentally.)  
&#62; If you had read my last post I don't see how you could have missed 
&#62; this.  Let me try again.  Quoted from my last post...
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;My point (yes, it was in there) is this ... let the guy play the 
&#62; game the way he wants.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; The &#34;yes, it was in there&#34; was in reference to my FIRST post 
&#62; where I made, though admittedly obscured, the same point.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, just to make sure that you can keep up here, I'll say it one 
&#62; last time.  (This is time number four.  I hope it's enough.)
&#62; 
&#62; ****Attention, here's the point!****
&#62; 
&#62; LET THE GUY PLAY THE GAME THE WAY HE WANTS!

ok, now next time put that on the line up there that saids Subject. 
ok? and why dont i let him play? because i dont want him to screw 
other newbies up!!! didnt u read my post??? god...

&#62; 
&#62; ****This concludes the point!****
&#62; 
&#62; So, you see, the critical point I was trying to convey was not that 
&#62; you were rude.  I have accepted this as a fact.  And yes, I know you 
&#62; admitted it.
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, now I'll take a moment to clarify, as I'm assuming this will 
&#62; probably be necessary.  You said you hate cheaters.  You also assumed 
&#62; that I do too.  Well you assumed WRONG.  I do NOT hate cheaters.  
well then i guess u would we have different opinions here. i try to 
stop people from cheating, and u just sit there and do nothing while 
playing with cheaters with ur legit character. huh?

&#62; Just because I have chosen not to cheat doesn't mean that everyone 
&#62; else has to do the same.  It CERTAINLY doesn't mean that I should 
&#62; HATE them because they disagree with me.
&#62; 
&#62; Finally, because I have had to make my point so many times here, and 
&#62; because it was CLEARLY stated in my last post, I'll leave you with a 
&#62; some quotes from a post of YOURS in this thread.  Remember, these are 
&#62; your own words.  Maybe you should try practicing what you preach.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;u stupid or something? ... u r getting quite annoying u know. i 
&#62; mean critisize me if u follow the whole thing. if u dont just shut 
&#62; the hell up!&#34; - DarkSniper

nice quotes from ONE reply. and why? because that person really 
annoys me, thats why i say what i said.

&#62; 
&#62; With what little respect I can muster,

do i care? i dont even know u.

&#62; 
&#62; P.S. to all:  All this controversy about cheating vs. legit is really 
&#62; getting old.  I have a feeling that I'll have to write a long post on 
&#62; the subject soon.  I guess you can consider this early warning of 
&#62; more rambling from me.  :-)

good cos i cant wait to reply on ur post. maybe we ll have an 
intellectual debate on this topic. i haven't have one for some time.
