Use flamewave.  I was in a game with two guys, and one of them was a 
pk.  They started fighting, and turned out that they both were 
cheaters with God-mode.  Rather than disengaging, they kept taunting 
each other, and firing all sorts of spells.  None of them worked 
until the pk used flamewave.  The flamewave killed the guy even 
though he had god mode enabled.

Later, I was playing my rogue when a stupid (no skills) pk (also a 
rogue) came hunting for me.  I knew she was a pk because I repeatedly 
stated that I wanted to play solo, but she sought me out.  I picked a 
good spot, and when she started attacking me, I fired back.  Even 
though my arrows and spells hit her, her hp did not go down.  So I 
used several flame waves, and her hit points kept going down. I ran 
out of heal potions, so I left the game before dying or killing, but 
atleast I know that flame wave worked.

BUT, I think there may be more than one cheat program out there, so 
flamewave may only work against one.</pre>
