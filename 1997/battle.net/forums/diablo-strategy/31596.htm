&#62; The eaglehorn was given to me from another high level rogue.  I know 
&#62; how much fun it is to play legitimately (now) Cause I recently was 
&#62; playing with a totally hacked up character now I have restarted him 
&#62; and it is a lot more fun. Well getting killed and losing my stuff 
&#62; aint that great but it's better then cheating *s*. Thanx to 
&#62; darksniper I &#34;saw the light&#34; (yep it's lil ol me, 
&#62; demosthenes. But my rogue is called Mystery)
&#62; 
&#62; But thanx for your concern *s*
&#62; 
&#62; Mystery lvl 14 rogue
&#62; Demosthenes lvl 16 mage
&#62; Acey lvl 17 warrior
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;always turn left. To turn right, turn left three times&#34;

great to see all my post has at least transformed one player! =) ur 
welcome.

i think random above just assumed that u cant get the eh which i 
agree with him, cos a level 14 rogue is pretty hard to find an eh;) 
btw is ur friend legit? hope he is. 

as for ur questions, the reason why u cant kill that pk is either 
their ac is too high and u keep on missing, or if he has a mana 
shield and u just didnt see it. but if u were in the dungeon first, 
then thats not possible cos u ll see it. what level was the mage? it 
is possible that he turns on his gods mode while playing with u, but 
turns it off when ur friend killed him too.

and advice ti u playing out there, try not to play with someone too 
much higher in level than u, unless u know that person can be 
trusted. 
or like i advice a lot of players join a clan. not necessarily mine, 
just join one the suits u.

as for the trading post... dont trade there, all u ll find is dupes 
and hacks. if i see a nice bow i ll save it for u. but of course it 
comes in a price that later on in ur career, u have to help newbies 
just like u once were and tell them legit is the way to go =)
