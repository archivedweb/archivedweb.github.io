<blockquote>
<pre>It's nice to see a little more open-minded, less dogmatic stance here 
on cheating, than elsewhere where people are more...weakminded.  I do 
agree that Diablo would have been an amazing game without cheating; 
however, cheating is/was fun in that you can learn a few interest 
(and illegal hehe) things if you like learning and aren't a lazy bum.

However, what I wanted to get into was a tad more academic (this post 
is taken from one I posted on Ogden's, but since everyone is having a 
hernea over Inferno and PoC love making, I'll see what reaction it 
may get here).

&#60;pause&#62; disclaimer: I might get a bit philosphical and 
boring, so feel free to exit at will.

First of all, is cheating wrong?  And where are these rulebooks that 
dictate such black and white laws, as if there were any in real life.

&#34;Wrong&#34; by definition has very little to do with facts or 
actual circumstances, it's based mostly on what odd ideas and 
opinions people have in their heads.  If murder is believed to be 
wrong by the masses (demagogues being both an important factor in 
influencing as well as taking advantage of people's biases), then 
it's wrong.  If killing animals is thought of as &#34;right&#34; by 
the majority of the masses, then its right.  If spam is thought of as 
a bad influence on kids, then dog gone it, Congress will pass a bill 
banning spam!  Like the old saying goes, the victor writes the 
history books the way he see's it, wishes it. 

Before I get into why people think cheating is wrong, here are a few 
types of styles of playing (different from &#34;players or 
characters&#34; since a player is one that subscribes to only one of 
these modes of play, or any given person might have a character 
that's pure and another that uses dupes) out on bnet.  There may be a 
few more qualifications that could be added to each, but since 
someone is bound to find fault with something or another, I'll make 
it as bare-bones as possible.  Let me also point out before hand that 
player killing and non-player killing could apply to ANY of these 
classes (player kill could be dueling as well as backstabbing).

1) Purism involves play on battlenet as if they were playing on 
single player. No duping or any abuse of glitches (even if its a lag 
stall), no interaction with other players (other than playing with 
legit players).

2) Legit play is distinct from the above, especially since the origin 
of any given weapon started being questionable beginning with the 
proliferation of the knowledge of duping back in the days of mid-1.00 
to early 1.01.  This style of play allows trading and accepting items 
and gold from reliable sources.

3) This third class gets into the concept of cheating as most people 
see it today.  For lack of a better name, I'll call it 
&#34;Promiscuous.&#34;  Most players who consider themselves legit in 
Ogden's Tavern follow this style.  Basically its an extention of 
legit with a few add ons. Most land here by default or accidental 
abuse (ever accepted an item only to find out it's duped later on?).  
This can also include usage of minor glitches in the game, such as 
the no-spells trick; the repeated cheainlightning (and 
other spells) that results in less mana usage; firewalling Diablo, 
dying when he's in the firewall, and then coming back down (he is 
damaged that way); or raising the mana shield before your opponent 
comes down so he can't see it.  In fact these are more &#34;tricks of 
the trade&#34;, and this category could just be dumped in with (2).  

3)  Yet another not-quite cheating-or-is-it? class is this one. 
SALMISSRA's (Queen of Wordgod clan ;-) trick of saving the 
dlinfo_*.drv files in the Window's directory (which I do not believe 
works, since character info is distributed around several files which 
are then compiled during program execution), Registry editing to 
change account numbers, and deleting bnetunin.exe to create new 
account numbers all fall in here. They arent illegal or 
&#34;malicious&#34; exactly, but sorta iffy.

4) Basically, not-so-mild &#34;tricks&#34; (drop the euphemism and 
call them glitches) and really abusing the game starts here.  Call it 
&#34;illegit&#34; play. Duping falls in here--even if you don't know 
how to dupe, but use duped items (not hacked items).  &#34;Touch of 
death&#34; related to the nova spell is another rather malicious one 
(and no, you won't get it out of me).  These are still not illegal or 
manipulating memory, but they are highly incongruous with how 
Blizzard intended the game to be played.

5)  &#34;Cheating.&#34;  And to make a distinction between cheating 
and hacking--hacking is finding and creating methods of malicious 
play, while cheating is the actual use of these.  Hacking is a 
totally different category than cheating.  Cheating is the style of 
playing *using* programs that alter memory or hacked items. 

I want to make another big distinction here--an operational one that 
applies in duels mostly.  Dueling with hacked weapons is a mode of 
play NOT using trainers or traders.  That means, only item hacks. 
Trainers, godmode, and auto-kill all fall into a sort of 
&#34;malicious&#34; category.  The reason I make this distinction is 
the mainly because dueling with hacked items involves definite talent 
if all parties are respectably matched.  This is something I should 
leave to a section qualifying dueling and pking, but it is a style of 
play widespread throughout bnet (at least when I used to duel).  I 
suppose though, now a days hacked item could be anything (Diablo 
Plate of Thinking anyone?  =), so this distinction is meaningless.

6) &#34;Cheating&#34; revisited.  I didn't feel like making 
&#34;another big distinction&#34; in (5), so this.  Cheating on 
&#34;chat&#34; and cheating in the &#34;game.&#34;  The former 
includes Pierre Stronzo's Diablo IP snooper, pinging, public channel 
op (ehehe, you're looking at the man who abused it so badly Blizzard 
had to actually do something about rather than wait for the next 
patch!), and a whole array of things you guys haven't seen yet but 
are gonna panic over! &#60;g&#62;

7) Hacking.  Actually editing program memory using Softice or a hex-
editor.  The big fellas like Pusgums, Stronzo, Kingnothing, 
LORDHACKER, Enigma, Raymond fall in here, as well as those of us 
who're just learning =)

Whew.  If there's something you'd like to add or subtract, feel free 
to These categories are thrown together from an old guild website 
that has long since ceased to exist along with various opinions and 
styles of play I've seen on bnet.

So what was the point of all that, aside from me wasting wasting good 
playing time? =)  Mainly to point out that &#34;cheating&#34; isn't 
so clear cut of an issue.  In fact, to throw another tangle into the 
fray, I just recently saw a cheating program out for sale in CompUSA. 
 So if you buy this (and it comes with godmode and some other 
programs), you're cheating...legally!  

But then again, I'll reiterate my original point here : cheating is 
what the masses see it as. It's a used as a catch phrase to bolster 
your self esteem--make you feel better when you lose a duel or when 
someone challenges you (look to Inferno for this trait).  There's no 
logic behind it besides the tit-for-tat mentality of those 
like...well, I wont name any names.

Everyone has a rationale behind how they play (just like they have 
behind living).  The legits make claims such as they paid $60 for 
Diablo, the game wasn't meant to be played in any other way, Blizzard 
says this is the right way, they have more talent thusly, they enjoy 
it more the way they play it.  Unfortunately, as right as these may 
seem, they are still opinions.  For everyone of the supposed facts, I 
can show you a rationale around it, equally as valid.  You paid $60 
bucks for the game, not for the &#34;free internet access.&#34;  Many 
cheaters are those who have already raised legit characters and know 
the game.  Instead of selling the CD, they simply found another 
source of amusement in this game.  Cheating is definitely enjoyable, 
in a different way, and in one that no one of you who speaks out of 
ignorance can know.

Cheaters as well have their rationale. Some say they don't like being 
pked, that its easier, that don't really believe duping IS cheating.  
Most of us realists don't give a flying f-ck, we're just happy having 
fun and getting more outta the game that we paid (or did we ;-).  

I admit it first, I'm totally human.  Everything I believe is but a 
mere perspective.  But then again, who's gonna be the judge of what's 
right? To each his own...until the guy with the gun in his hand 
show's up anyway.
