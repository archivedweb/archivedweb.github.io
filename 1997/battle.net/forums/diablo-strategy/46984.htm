<pre>I haven't posted here in a long time.  My CPU crashed and a lvl22 
Qqazres (2 legitimate dots, I had DS on the edge of his seat).  But 
now the BNM thing is getting kind of old.  So I thought I'd write 
this post.  In reply to Woody's quiz  I would be a Tweener.  But I 
think that some questions were off target.  For Instance if ds rot n 
sa abut Allifer Tist he mite loos hiz mind n try 2 shoot duh wf  up 
hiz .... Well you get the picture.  Also in regards to the I will die 
if I dont post question , I know I could not go through three days 
without flaming Kalibos (hey where is he????)  That all about Woody's 
quiz!


           NOW I would like to address Bostic and the Forum Police

I think you should know that in John's &#34;goodbye&#34; post he 
might have added in some &#34;UO SPAM&#34; .  Arent you going to 
harrass him to know end?   

AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  I tried to get through this post without 
it happening but now I must confess, for the last week I have 
secretly been channeling the speret uf dursknipper et d most opretin 
times.  I well now return too my qqazres ferm.  Ahh!  Its good to be 
back!

Where did Lok go?????????

Where did Aahz go????????

Where did Kal go??????

Boohoo noone to flame.  Except ds !

Qqazres pop quiz question.

If ds FB'd Woody in the fast lane for driving to slow , and then 
found out his wf is a dup, would Bostic drop his book through a table 
before Kalibos was ever serious???

Now you know what happens when I get really really bored!





Answers to questions

1)if you said ds was never smart enuf 2 red a bok uf fb den u wer 
rite.

2)If you bothered to care your'e just a nerd

3)If you thought Kalibos would ever be serious your'e an even bigger 
nerd
