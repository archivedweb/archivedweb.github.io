&#62; 2)  I'd also like to hear from you prominent warriors and rogues.  
&#62; How do you like your mage friends to play?  What spells do you like 
&#62; to see them cast?  Which spells or tactics make you want to fill them 
&#62; full of arrows or cut off their ear with your sword?
&#62; 

1. 
Your willingness to sit back and stone is admirable.  Wanna play a 
game? &#60;g&#62;   

Seriously though, my &#34;regular&#34; mage friend gets bored with 
that
strategy.  I can't blame him since the few times I've tried it with
my (much lower level) mage, I got bored also.  

One idea I had for making stonecurse less boring is to pop off 
a few charge bolts in among the curses.  They're essentially
free, they do damage to critters so you get to share exp, but they 
don't do so much damage to ROP that they turn around and
come after you.  Like I said, its just an idea.  I haven't had the
opportunity to try it out yet.

2.
The mage leads, thinning the herd then retreating to let ROP take
care of the rest works pretty well.  Sometimes.  When everything
lines up just right.  He often just wipes everything out, which is
boring for ROP.  Also he sometimes activates and leaves more 
than ROP can handle (especially me with a rogue's hit points).

-1.
Generally we just take turns leading, and are working on our
understanding of how to handle retreating, swarms, immunes 
and such.  This is less interesting from a coordinated play
perspective, but less hassle when trying to communicate
through the chat window.

I did have the opportunity to play with some friends on a lan
for several days.  We all started new chars, so we never even
got to nightmare mode, so our problems/strategies were
quite different from the hell/hell situation.  But it was an
absolute BLAST!  To be able to sit there fighting and talking
at the same time was great!  We were able to do a lot more
coordination and on-the-spot tactical adjustments.  Really
upped the experience another notch - I highly recommend
it.  I hope to get together with my mage friend some Saturday
for a network game soon.  Hauling a machine around is
a pain, but well worth it.
