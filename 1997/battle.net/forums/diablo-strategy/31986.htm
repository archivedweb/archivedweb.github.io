&#62; &#62; Now.. i've played with all the classes(although my rogue and wizard 
&#62; &#62; are still low levels), and have been in games with all classes. and 
&#62; &#62; the following is my opion of the classes.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The all around easiest to play is the rogue. Its a welll rounded 
&#62; &#62; fighter, skilling in both range attacks and close up. she's good for 
&#62; &#62; almost any situation.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; the warrior. My personal favorite. very easy to play on the lower 
&#62; &#62; levels of the game(normal, and into the caves on noghtmare), but then 
&#62; &#62; it becomes much more difficult to play with him. In the higher levels 
&#62; &#62; of nightmare and hell (game settings), it becomes deadly to fight 
&#62; &#62; some of the monsters up close. The range attack is essential for 
&#62; &#62; playing here, but the warrior sucks with it(in most cases).
&#62; &#62; If you die playing solo, forget it. You'll be playing for a good15 
&#62; &#62; minutes up to 1.5 hours trying to get your stuff back, from a large 
&#62; &#62; pack of archers(i did this last night.. got caught with a good 30 
&#62; &#62; archers... 20 were on the screen.. I couldn't walk in the room 
&#62; &#62; without dieing, or going through 4 potions instantly)
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The wizzard. The exact opposite of the warrior. Difficult to manage 
&#62; &#62; through the lower levels because of the lack of spells. But is ggreat 
&#62; &#62; in the higher levels with his powerful range attacks. Even if he dies 
&#62; &#62; he can usually get all his stuff back with a couple trips back down.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; With all this in mind, i choose the warrior as the best class. Why? 
&#62; &#62; because as the game goes on its harder for him to play and strategy 
&#62; &#62; becomes much more important. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Mezon
&#62; &#62; level 32 warrior
&#62; 
&#62; Um.....I would have to say the rogue is the best because she has long 
&#62; range attacks (which is almost needed in hell on any level) and 
&#62; pretty good magic so if u die and u have some decent spells u can 
&#62; still get your stuff back just not as fast as a mage in higher levels.


All you guys are talking about multyplayer games because of hell/hell
and stuff.  If you do play on multyplayer alot then you always play
with someone else.  So why bother asking what the best class is?
Why don't you just find 2 other people that arn't the same class as
you.  So a warrior can do close range attacks, a rogue long range,
and mages spell attacks.  And pesonaly i am not sure if you guys are
legit but if you are and if you try the game is a lot more fun and a 
lot
more hard on any dif.
