<pre>&#62; &#34;Cheaters&#34; tend to be boring to play with, and are often 
&#62; bored themselves.  
&#62; While this obviously has its exceptions, it is usually true.  It just 
&#62; comes with 
&#62; the territory of having everything too easy.  While sometimes 
&#62; annoying 
&#62; when they use their boosted items/powers to kill all the monsters or 
&#62; otherwise take the challenge of the game away, they are relatively 
&#62; harmless, and an unwanted encounter with one is easily remedied by
&#62; gracefully backing out of the game, if asking them to stop doesn't 
&#62; work.
&#62; 
&#62; Cheaters have managed to spoil open trading on bnet, but that is 
&#62; mostly a
&#62; technical problem.  It could be solved in the future with the 
&#62; generation
&#62; of unique ID's (as used in Windows 95/NT object registry) and server
&#62; registration of ownership.
&#62; 
&#62; PKillers, thieves, spammers, foul-mouths, and loosers who whisper
&#62; annoying or offensive messages to everyone with a feminine name can
&#62; all be lumped together as juvenile jerks who take advantage of the
&#62; faceless anonymity of the internet to engage in social behavior which
&#62; would be unacceptable anywhere outside of a correctional 
&#62; institution.  They are twisted perverts who get their jollies preying 
&#62; on 
&#62; innocent people, yet they are too cowardly to do it in person, 
&#62; prefering
&#62; the safety of hiding behind their computer.  Anyone behaving like they
&#62; do in public would be a social outcast, if not imprisoned or
&#62; institutionalized.  
&#62; 
&#62; You constantly hear them say &#34;it's only a game&#34; or &#34;its 
&#62; just for fun&#34;, as if
&#62; that somehow excuses rudeness.  Most parents punish their children if 
&#62; they play with others like these jerks do.  Yet the fact that there 
&#62; is no
&#62; way to &#34;enforce&#34; polite social behavior, and no chance of 
&#62; retaliation or
&#62; negative consequences for their actions, emboldens them to continue
&#62; their anti-social behavior.  
&#62; 
&#62; I shudder to think what may happen in the future when the thrill of 
&#62; this 
&#62; &#34;harmless&#34; preying on the innocent wears off.  What's next 
&#62; when 
&#62; nobody is around to abuse on bnet, or the thrill gets too weak to 
&#62; stimulate anymore?  What is the next level of attack, another game?  
&#62; Eventually all the games will pale.  Then what, go for real money?  
&#62; How about real people?  Its a long road from killing some 9 year old 
&#62; trying out battlenet for the first time to assaulting a real human, 
&#62; but 
&#62; the willingness to do the one (and the pleasure derived from it) 
&#62; indicates 
&#62; that the only thing preventing the other may be the cowardliness of 
&#62; the 
&#62; perpetrator.
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry about the preaching, but this b.s. I keep hearing about its ok
&#62; because its a game is just that, B.S.  If I agree to a competitive, 
&#62; everyone for himself game, its OK.  But if I want to play a nice,
&#62; friendly, _cooperative_ game, why can't I do it without worrying
&#62; about some pimple-faced nerd intentionally trying to ruin it for me?
&#62; After all, it IS a GAME.  Why can't we play &#34;nice&#34; together?
&#62; 
&#62; I guess that all goes to show that I, too, prefer playing in an 
&#62; environment filled with cheaters, to one filled with ruthless
&#62; player killers.  If I wanted that, I would go back to doom or quake 
&#62; where the whole object is to kill each other.
&#62; 
&#62; Now I have a question to pose on top of yours:
&#62; 
&#62; Does anyone think battlenet would/could have lasted even a 
&#62; month without private games?  
&#62; 
&#62; These are the only way to play together with people outside of 
&#62; your house, while still exercising control over who you play with.  
&#62; Without this ability, I think battlenet, and quite possibly Diablo, 
&#62; would have been a radically different &#34;community&#34;.  I wonder
&#62; just what kind of &#34;community&#34; Ultima Online will produce, 
&#62; without
&#62; that ability to ever let your guard down and just enjoy the game
&#62; with friends, without worrying about some stranger coming in to
&#62; hose your game for the &#34;fun&#34; of it.
&#62; 

I really enjoyed your post.... not because you agree or disagree with 
me but because like Aahz, you &#34;thought&#34; about it and expanded 
on it. 

As for your comment on not having &#34;private&#34; Bnet games.... 
i'm in total agreement. Diablo would have turned into a fast frenzied 
&#34;Quake&#34; like game, short lived at best.

I really think ALOT of people continually forget about Diablo being a 
game designed from the ground up *NOT* being an Internet game. Diablo 
was intended to be played as a single player dungeon crawl by Condor 
up in Canada. When Blizz bought out Condor and turned them into 
Blizzard North, the concept of adding Bnet was brought up. Had Bnet 
not existed, nobody would have ever cared if cheats existed or not. 
But, Bnet was added and now we have the dilema of cheating and ethics.

Sure it's unethical to cheat.... but I personally feel it's MORE 
unethical to PK than cheat (well, mild cheating that is). Most 
cheaters are not a problem... they lack experience that the true 
players have and even with the most incredible items in the game they 
continually have problems. It's very ironic to me that the 
&#34;holier than thou&#34; types feel it's more of a sin to use a 
dup'ed item than it is to hunt down an unsuspecting person and 
possibly discourage them forever from playing Diablo (read in Tavern 
right now about the PK's that pked a player 208 times because the 
player did not speak english and did not konw what was going on..... 
it's SAD and pisses me off that these bastards &#34;brag&#34; about 
it).

&#60;venting over&#62;

Anyway UO will be an interesting experience..... nobody knows just 
how it will turn out but I have my doubts. Well thanks for taking the 
time to respond to my post (it wasn't that long). I'm also glad to 
see someone else who is more concerned with just having fun than in 
this &#34;holy&#34; war against *gasp* someone using a dup'd KSOH 
(RUN FOR THE HILLS EVERYONE!!!) hahahha later..
