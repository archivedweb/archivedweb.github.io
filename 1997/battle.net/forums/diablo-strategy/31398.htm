<pre>My opinion is u r not cheating.

But I myself don't use any character backup program. The way I see
it is that every time I make a stupid mistake and get myself
killed, there's a chance that I might permanently lose my stuff
(unretrievable because of monsters, dumba** mistake of exiting
the game, timeouts, or program bugs). I take it as the price I pay
for getting killed, and learn from my mistake.

I have not lost anything, yet, because I was not able to retrieve it
from monsters. But I have lost many things due to other reasons. I
was always able to find a replacement for the lost items soon after.
It's always exciting finding a good magical item that you can use.

&#62; 	I died in lv 15 , surrounded by about 20 immune all blood star . 
&#62; Actually , reason is due to that I can't drink full mana portion 
&#62; while switching weapon . Hence i loss all stuff + a 20 charges A 
&#62; staff . ok, i restart at town , I down the hell(lv 13) and back to 
&#62; town to see if the witch offer me a A staff . After about 15 mins 
&#62; down and up , the witch offer me a 11 charges A staff . Then I back 
&#62; to lv 15 , killed all the witch by that A staff except only one was 
&#62; still alive , . I see my stuff, and stoned that witch , and using my 
&#62; staff kick that ass . I was so glad at that moment ,and try to turn 
&#62; the music on . Hence i pressd the esc key , but my righthand still 
&#62; clicking on the mouse. Wow, the whole screen turned into black , and 
&#62; i quited the game , $&#37;$^&&#37;&&#37;. What the hell , this really 
&#62; fuck me up . Damn it , i restore the backup of my mage at lv 44 . 
&#62; 	will u guys may consider this as cheat ?   </pre>
