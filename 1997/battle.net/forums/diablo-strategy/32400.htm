<pre>Well, I read in this form about creating a new character and putting 
a &#34;II&#34; on the end of the name, so that is what i did, this is 
my new rogue, DeathAngel-II.  I started off in the church as usual 
and almost immediately came across enchanted rags, wow i thought, 
enchanted rags!!!  This was great, i later id'd the rags and they 
were rags of health -1 dmg. from enemies!!!  I was off to a good 
start, i encountered 2 unique monsters on lvl 1 which gave a blue 
mace of light, resist lightning +18&#37; and +20 light radius, and 
also i got strong cap of light +38&#37; armor +20&#37; light radius.  
I was off to a good start.  To make a long story short i also found a 
cape of jaguar +19 hp on lvl 2 and a spiders staff of holy bolt on 
lvl 2 (+mana).  I defeated the butcher by trapping him in a room with 
bars on it, but surprisingly becuase of my low to hit&#37; and 
because of my bad aiming, it took my two bows to kill him, i had my 
first bow and it broke while trying to killhim, i had to take the 
long walk to town and buy another one then i  killed him, he dropped 
a UNIQUE SABRE, which ended up to be the defender, a unique i had not 
seen before, +5 ac, +5 vit, -5 to hit&#37;.  As i was almost done 
with lvl 2 i saw a unique skel, he had a bunch of followers with him 
and after kiling his followers i preceded on him, when i was about 
half done iwth him i was running out of potions in my belt so i 
scampered off to refill, i then started beating on him, he eventually 
died and gave some stupid sabre.  Anyway i wen tot town and was going 
to repair my prime items, the cloak of jaguar and strong cap of light 
when i noticed, THEY WERE MISSING!!!!  I realized that they had broke 
during my fight with the skels, OH NOO!!!!!!  well being so depressed 
i got my backup rags of health on and left he game, then i came onto 
here to tell everyone how i did but i lost practically everything i 
had.
