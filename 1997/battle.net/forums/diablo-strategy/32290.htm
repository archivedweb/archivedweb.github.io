<pre>I was very intrigued by Code Myster's suggestion that you find better 
armor in hell when you have none, so I tried a little experiment last 
night (similar to the one Lok described in a post below).  I have 
been playing a legit level 37 mage with obsidian full plate of 
harmony, dreamflange, stormshield, royal circlet, and so-so jewelry.  
I started a normal game, immediately ditched the armor (and my spare, 
saintly gothic plate of the tiger) in town, and headed down to hell.  
I did four Laz runs, teleporting directly to level 15 and killing 
only the uniques on that level.  The results:

Run #1: jade gothic plate of sorcery (+28&#37;, +19, ac 59) from Laz; 
plate of the tiger (ac 47) from one of his witches; demonspike coat 
from Vizier.

(Needless to say, this got me pretty excited.  Armor seemed to be 
flyin' left and right; this is more than I usually find in ten Laz 
runs.)

Run #2: full plate of the ages from one of Laz's witches.
Run #3: nothing.

(I began to wonder if run #1 was just an unusually good seed.)

Run #4: full plate of giants from one of Laz's witches; awesome 
breast plate of sorcery from an armor rack.  (Has anyone besides me 
noticed that armor racks tend to yield unusually good prefixes and 
suffixes?)

Now, I have been trying to replace that obsidian full plate of mine 
for a  *long* time, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that 
this is at least two to three times more magic armor than I normally 
find.

So, my hypothesis?  The game is Marxist: From each according to his 
means, to each according to his needs.  This would explain why 
everyone seems to get great drops when they are forced to restart 
naked.  If true, it should also apply to other types of equipment, 
right?

I invite everyone to try this and refute or confirm my theory.  
Experiment, please, and post the results!
