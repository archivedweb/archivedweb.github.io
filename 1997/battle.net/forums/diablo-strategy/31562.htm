<pre>hi,

My rogue was recently PK'd for the first time *mumble mumble* I was 
using eaglehorn, you see.  This pk (he was a mage) started casting a 
firewall in between him and me. And although he persisted he wasn't 
using god mode (and this was true as later on a friend had his ear)
He wouldn't die. I was hitting him nearly everytime. He wasn't using 
mana shield either. Is this because eagle horns  damage sux??? I was 
using a amulet of radiance and a ring of the eagle. 

If that is the case. What bow would be the best. I have 45 str and 
can boost it up to 70 when using an amulet of the titans.  What would 
the best bow I should be looking for on the trading post?

Also, what do you do when you are playing as a mage and the creatur 
is immune to fire?? I have lvl 9 fireball but only level 4 lightning. 
and chain lightning eats up my mana (around 200) really quick. I'm 
currently using a lightning staff of fireball and using that it takes 
for ever to kill one. so by the time I've killed two my mana shield 
is down and it's all over. 

Please anyone (particularly high level rogues and mages) help,

Mystery 
level 14 rogue.</pre>
