<pre>OK, St. Mike and Dizzy, I've decided to take your excellent advice.
Enought about cheating already!!!!  Let's talk about something else,
like how to play the dam game!!!  Let's talk tactics, and the best
(your favorite) mix of characters for a multi (3 or 4) group!

  OK, for a high level group (30+) I'm sold on 2/3 rogues and 1/2 
mages.  I played (29 l rogue) with DarkSniper (rogue-level 36, i 
think-not sure, sorry DS) and Aahz (l 45 mage) in nm hell.  Let me
tell you, the combination of MASS stoning and arrows is unbelievable.
I don't think a warrior would fit in well here, because arrows flew
in every direction, almost constantly.  Too much possibility of
friendly fire.  I think this tactic will probably work real well only 
if the mage is high enough to make mass stone cursing practical.
  Low to mid level (1-25 or so), I really like to get a SKILLED 
fighter in there.  It is definitely challenging, and helps develop 
tactics, communication, and patience!
  To elaborate, each group member must know, and act on, his/her role.
The fighter has to be able to charge in there, while not activating 
too many creatures, and protect the ranged attackers from the melee 
beasties.  The ranged attackers must provide cover fire if/when the 
warrior is overwhelmed, take out the distance baddies, and provide 
other magical support (I like healing my companions, myself . . .), 
all the while being patient enough to let the fighter take his 
position before screaming out the arrows/magic.  The same lesson in 
patience goes for the fighter; he must be able to draw fire away from 
the ranged guys ('cause, most likely, he's the one who can take the 
most hits) while not getting so close as to scare them away (dam 
goats!! hate 'em . . .)

  This poses a problem in hell.  When you have a room full of 
bwitches, the only way the fighter can be really effective is to have 
a free range of motion in order to chase down and corner them (while 
avoiding the bloodstars!); the mage/rogue needs a clear field in 
order to fire at will.  These are mutually exclusive needs; but, with 
clear communication before hand, and careful execution during, it can 
be accomplished (ex: warrior:I'll stay to the top half; you clear out 
the bottom   or something like that).

To sum up:  I like a 3 person group (right, Dizzy?? ;-} ) with one of
each class at levels below 30, and 3 or 4 person group with at least 
2 rogues and at least 1 wizard (stone curse a must--thanx for the 
lesson Aahz!)

That's my take.  I'd like to hear others' opinions on group tactics; 
it seems a useful subject in a strategy forum. . . .maybe it's just 
me . . .

fight the good fight,
Boots</pre>
