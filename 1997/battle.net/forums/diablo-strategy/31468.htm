&#62;  In real life (I'm 
&#62; speaking generally now..), there is no godmode or any cheats

So in your REAL WORLD, can you borrow your neighbor's car and dupe 
it?  Or babysit your well mannered/pottytrained nephew, and dupe him? 
 Of course not.  You have to earn the money or go through the 
troubles.  Since you admit to not being legit, I don't see your point.

&#62; This time it is over items.... Which items are legit and which ones 
&#62; aren't?  Is GPOW legit or Godly shield.. or Kings Sword of 
&#62; Slaughter.. Godly Helm of the whale and Obsidion rings of Zodiac???  

These are all legit items.  At least, originally.  However, the ones 
you have are not, since you question its legitimacy.  Although these 
items were probably found by someone at one point, they have been 
duped en masse.  People give these away to other characters because 
it means nothing to them.  Afterall, they can dupe another one.

&#62; And... Why in the hell do people CHEAT?

Why do you cheat?

&#62; I don't mind dying just as 
&#62; long as nobody get's my #1 pkk Character's ear... it's 2 valuable

Nobody wants it.
 
&#62; (some bas****s want it)  I wouldn't mind losing my ear to a 
&#62; noncheater but to a cheater?  An ear is a proof of a kill.  You 
&#62; really didn't kill someone if you used cheats.

So I guess you really didn't kill anyone.

Take a look at the reply you got to your post below.  Although he is 
a moron, he has a point.  You have stopped playing Diablo, and are 
now a PK.  Your justification is that you only hunt down PK's.  
However...
1. It doesn't solve anything.  They only lose an ear.
2. If they don't cheat, they will not care if you kill them since you 
cheat.
3. If they do cheat, you probably can't kill them.  (Probably, this 
is why you hate cheaters)

I wouldn't have responded, but you stated below that you hate PK's, 
but in essence, you are one.  Afterall, imagine a reformed PK playing 
cooperatively in a game with 2 players, and after an hour's work, 
finally reach Laz's chamber, and in you come trying to kill one of 
them.  Who is the PK?  Also, in this post, you state that you hate 
cheaters, but again, you are one.  Afterall, if you dupe, you have 
access to limitless gold.  If you have access to limitless gold, 
what's to stop you from buying the best items Griswold has to offer.  
And if he doesn't have the best items, no problem, you can just keep 
buying from his inventory to refresh his stock and eventually, you 
will get a nice offer.  If you can get the best items anyway, why not 
write a program to give yourself the best item.  And since with the 
best items, the monsters are too easy, why not change your level to 
fight at nightmare games.  And since you can get resistance from 
dupes anyway, why not increase your resistance to 100&#37; by using a 
character editor.  In fact, since you can increase your stats anyway, 
why not raise your stats to 250.  Since with the 250 attributes you 
have no limitations, why not just increase all your spells to 15, or 
even 150.  And since with limitless wealth you can buy huge numbers 
of scrolls, why not just use the trainer to memorize non-book spells 
(i.e. identify, infravision, apocalypse, etc...).  And so on, and so 
on and so on...

I don't care how you get joy from the game, but think before you 
talk.  As Mark Twain once said (paraphrase) &#34;It's better to 
remain silent and have people think you're an idiot, than to open 
your mouth and remove all doubt.&#34;</pre>
