&#62; Enought about cheating already!!!!  Let's talk about something else,
&#62; like how to play the dam game!!!  Let's talk tactics, and the best
&#62; (your favorite) mix of characters for a multi (3 or 4) group!

*Finally* a topic that actually fits the name of the forum!  :)

&#62;   OK, for a high level group (30+) I'm sold on 2/3 rogues and 1/2 
&#62; mages.  I played (29 l rogue) with DarkSniper (rogue-level 36, i 
&#62; think-not sure, sorry DS) and Aahz (l 45 mage) in nm hell.  Let me
&#62; tell you, the combination of MASS stoning and arrows is unbelievable.

I haven't been in many 4 player games yet.  I usually play with a 
mage (I play a rogue), and I can't begin to count the times when an 
extra rogue shooting at the stoned monsters would've helped.  I don't 
mind the mage blasting away with fireballs (as long as he's careful - 
I've only been killed by his fireballs three times, each time I was 
standing right next to him - hint hint :).  I also don't mind him 
using chaing lightning IF we make it clear beforehand so I can keep 
my distance and also try to position myself off to the side (not in 
front! :).

For rogue-rogue games, try crossing your arrow streams.  This works 
pretty well in hallways - it assures that any monsters trying to 
reach you have to cross at least one stream.  It's also nifty in 
doorways to open rooms:

      s   s   s
    s   s   s   s  &#60;--- monsters
      s   s   s 
########    ########
       @    @ &#60;--- rogues

          @ &#60;--- mage

(ok, so my nethack/moria background is showing :)  Both rogues fire 
into the room, crossing streams to set up a kill zone.  The mage is 
optional :), but he can stand there and fireball monsters that are 
stunned by the arrows or get through.  He can also stone if you have 
to beat a hasty retreat.

&#62; I don't think a warrior would fit in well here, because arrows flew
&#62; in every direction, almost constantly.  Too much possibility of
&#62; friendly fire.  

That has me wondering just how useful weird/strange bows are in 
multiplayer.  The warrior's AC is probably much higher than the 
monsters' AC.  I'm not exactly sure how AC and hit&#37; interrelate, 
but it's definitely not linear, so you should be able to adjust your 
hit&#37; to where you only occasionally hit the warrior, but usually 
hit the monsters.  Maybe a bow with a -hit&#37;?

&#62; I think this tactic will probably work real well only 
&#62; if the mage is high enough to make mass stone cursing practical.

If you're a skilled rogue, you should be helping the mage by stoning
monsters as well.  :)  I've helped a mage out of a tough spot several 
times when he's been swarmed.  The monsters kept him stunned and 
unable to teleport until I stoned a couple of them.

&#62;   To elaborate, each group member must know, and act on, his/her role.
&#62; The fighter has to be able to charge in there, while not activating 
&#62; too many creatures, and protect the ranged attackers from the melee 
&#62; beasties.  The ranged attackers must provide cover fire if/when the 
&#62; warrior is overwhelmed, take out the distance baddies, and provide 
&#62; other magical support (I like healing my companions, myself . . .), 
&#62; all the while being patient enough to let the fighter take his 
&#62; position before screaming out the arrows/magic.  

Definitely.  Too often in those stupid &#34;which class is best&#34; 
debates, &#34;best&#34; is defined by which class can clear fastest 
solo.  I'm sorry but any dolt can cut loose with raw power to wipe 
out all the monsters.  Just like the U.S. could get rid of the 
problems in the Middle East once and for all by nuking the entire 
region.  The challenge is to apply the power selectively to achieve 
the desired goal, while minimizing the number of casualties.  That's 
why I really like multiplayer - it forces you to hold back and think 
about what you're doing, and work together with the other players.

&#62; The same lesson in 
&#62; patience goes for the fighter; he must be able to draw fire away from 
&#62; the ranged guys ('cause, most likely, he's the one who can take the 
&#62; most hits) while not getting so close as to scare them away (dam 
&#62; goats!! hate 'em . . .)

That's a good tactic - cover for the others.  The mage I usually play 
with has a hotkey set to say &#34;Wait!  Filling belt!&#34;  Whenever 
I see this, if we're fighting monsters that fire, I try to position 
myself 

A)  perpendicular with him so I can draw their fire away from him,
or
B)  in between so I can absorb their fire before it reaches him

either way he doesn't have to worry about getting hit while shuffling 
his inventory.
