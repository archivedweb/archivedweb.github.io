&#62; I just went through the last couple pages of posts and found many 
&#62; that said you can't buy Godly Full Plate of the Whale because it 
&#62; would cost too much -- thus the game doesn't even offer it. I can't 
&#62; dispute it being offered, because I've never been offered it. BUT, I 
&#62; do know of people who have legit Kings Swords of Haste (or something 
&#62; else equally nice), who say Grizwold will offer you around 67k for 
&#62; it. Now, how in the world could you buy a sword like that (which I'm 
&#62; told Grizwold offers from time to time), if 67k * 4 = 268k? The only 
&#62; reasonable explanation is that there is a ceiling for the cost of 
&#62; items. Personally, I've never seen anything offered over 140k. Does 
&#62; this sound reasonable, or am I talking out my other end?

It could be that their King's Swords of Haste are so expensive 
because they are indestructible, instead of having the normal 
maximum durability (for a bastard sword it's like 50). The game 
would never offer an indestructible KSOH, but when you make it
indestructible you increase its value.

You can make a sword indestructible through two methods:

1. Hacking (this is the most common way)
2. Get the sword's maximum durability to end in the digit 5. This 
can be done by using the warrior's item repair skill, which can lower
max durability. Then use LOTS of hidden shrines, which can increase
the max durability by 10 each time. The item will become 
indestructible when the maximum durability is 255.</pre>
