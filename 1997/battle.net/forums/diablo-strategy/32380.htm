&#62; I know there are those who will not want to read this post or even 
&#62; hear about what I'm about to post. For those in this group, do not 
&#62; scroll down. Leave now. 
&#62; 
&#62; I am about to discuss the most amazing strategy I have seen yet in 
&#62; Diablo. It makes the game so *EASY* that it is possible for a newbie 
&#62; to enter Hell Hell and beat EVERYTHING without armor or even advanced 
&#62; weapons.
&#62; 
&#62; This is unethical to the point of cheating... but it's legal, uses no 
&#62; cheats, no hacked items ... nothing but a simple strategy. It has 
&#62; forever changed my view of Diablo knowing how easy it is to kill 
&#62; EVERYTHING ... it's facinating yet depressing.
&#62; 
&#62; SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!
&#62; 
Well I think you really mean that any cheating 1st level character 
can beat hell hell using this because no 1st level legit character 
will get enough equipment to last any amount of time in hell hell 
without some serious cheats or some serious gifts.
I mean if you are a 1st level rogue and do not cheat you start off at 
around 60 hp which in hell hell means you will die with one hit by 
anything. If you don't get any items from other players you cannot 
possibly gets one ring of darkness so forget about getting 2. Also at 
first level you would never be able to hit anything on Hell Hell so 
you would not be able to kill anything either. 
Even if you get good armor, bow, helmet, and amulet you may push upto 
about 150&#37; MAX (just a guess) to hit and AC 200 (another guess) 
while using 2 rings of darkness. Which is still to low for a 1st 
level character to last any time on Hell Hell. It is my understanding 
that on Hell Hell the monsters are extremely tough. I had a very 
powerful 30+ level legit fighter and I had a hard time on Nightmare 
Hell.
While I do not doubt what you are detailing I do however doubt very 
much that ant legit low level (or probably decent level character) 
has any chance in Hell (excuse the pun) of performing these actions 
and living. </pre>
