&#62;  If you want to participate in this survey, please answer the 
&#62; questions *BEFORE* you read other peoples replies (in order to 
&#62; preserve answers). I want each of your opinions.
&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; This is a simple survey of what people concider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; is or is not, cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

  No, but I limit myself to borrowing rather than accepting
gifts and the quantity is within my normal income range.
I also only do it with people I'm playing with, and
who I'm sure _earned_ the money rather than duped it. 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

  No, but it _may_ spoil the fun, so I've never done it, 
although I can easily imagine circumstances where I
would.  And I would have the lower level char pay
for it.  And just what exactly is a higher level char?
10 levels? 5 levels? 1 level? 2 experience points?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

  No, but I will pay them for it (see above).  Is it cheating to 
have lower level characters buy items for you?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

  No, but it _may_ spoil the fun, so I've never done it, 
although I can easily imagine circumstances where I
would.  And I would have the lower level char pay
for it.  And just what exactly is a higher level char?
10 levels? 5 levels? 1 level? 2 experience points?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

  I don't think so, but I'm not sure what it is, and I don't
think I've ever done it.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?

  No.  Is it cheating to start games with the intent to go to
the dungeons, but then change your mind and quit after
buying something from Adria or Griz?  Is it cheating if you
quit when someone calls and you decide to go out for the
evening and have a life instead of playing computer games?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

  No.  Is it cheating to run a credit check on a potential
customer/supplier?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

  No, but it may be pretty tough on those characters.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?

  Maybe.  It certainly violates the &#34;spirit&#34; of the game as  
envisioned by Blizzard, but so what?  As a gamer since the late
70's,  I have yet to find a game company that was able to 
produce a _perfect_ set of rules, or who was omniscient
enough to forsee all the ways players would twist or enhance
those rules to make it more fun FOR THOSE PLAYERS.  These
guys aren't perfect, none of us are.  Their vision isn't perfect
either, and even if it is for them, we all have different needs,
and what is the perfect gaming environment for them is
obviously not going to be the perfect gaming environment
for everyone.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

  No, but it _may_ spoil the fun, so I don't do it with all my 
characters.  I generally only trade between characters of
equivalent levels, and always have the receiving char pay
for it (at least until money ceases to be a problem).

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

  If it is a friendly game, where everyone has agreed to
cooperate (or joined a game in which cooperation is
asked/expected) then yes, it is cheating to PK.  If it is
a duel, or an agreed everyone-for-himself game, then
no, PKing is not cheating in and of itself.  How do you
Pk someone with Nova? Trigger a trap?  Do they even
have scrolls?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

  Yes, but it harms no one, and does nothing but
save time wasted clicking and waiting  (that's quality
play time?).  Never done it.  I think I know how, but I've
just never bothered.  Is it cheating to teleport from 
room to room in the dungeons just to get from one
place to another quicker?  Why is one somehow
morally abhorrent while the other is perfectly
acceptible?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

  Yes, but so what.  I have not only invested money
but major amounts of time in this game.  I am playing
(and paying) for MY pleasure, not some self-righteous
purist's, and I think Blizzard screwed up by not building
backups into the game.  I understand why they didn't, but
I think they threw out the baby with the bath water on 
this one.

&#62; 
&#62; Anwer honestly! I'll post later with my views on the above later 
&#62; today.
