&#62; &#62; That has me wondering just how useful weird/strange bows are in 
&#62; &#62; multiplayer.  The warrior's AC is probably much higher than the 
&#62; &#62; monsters' AC.  I'm not exactly sure how AC and hit&#37; interrelate, 
&#62; &#62; but it's definitely not linear, so you should be able to adjust your 
&#62; &#62; hit&#37; to where you only occasionally hit the warrior, but usually 
&#62; &#62; hit the monsters.  Maybe a bow with a -hit&#37;?
&#62;
&#62;   This is where the patience comes in.  The warrior takes up 
&#62; position, then the rogue and mage take up position to back him up.  
&#62; 90 degrees from the warrior works well, when possible.

I should explain this more succinctly

C  100&#37; |                       ******************xxxxxxx
h       |                    ***               xxx
a       |                  **                xx
n       |                 *                 x

e   50&#37; |                *                 x
T       |               *                 x
o       |             **                xx
H       |          ***               xxx
i       |**********xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
t    0&#37; +---------|----------|----------|---------|-----
        50&#37;      100&#37;       150&#37;   ^   200&#37;      
250&#37;   ^
                    Rogue's hit&#37;                     

Where * is a monster with AC 120, and x your warrior friend with an 
AC of 230.  This is hypothetical of course since I haven't seen the 
source code, but because obscenely high AC can sometimes be hit, and 
obscenely high hit&#37; can sometimes miss, it probably looks 
something
like this.

My thinking on the weird/strange bow is as follows.  Say you're using 
one and you have a 300&#37; hit&#37;.  If you look at the above 
graph, you're
virtually guaranteed to hit both the monster (*) and your warrior (x).
But if you switch to another bow and lower your hit&#37; to around 
170&#37;, you're still nearly guaranteed to hit the monster, but 
you're almost certain to miss the warrior.  I don't expect the 
difference in the real game is as huge as my graph makes it out to 
be, but this is ASCII and I don't feel like redrawing it.  :)

&#62; &#62; If you're a skilled rogue, you should be helping the mage by stoning
&#62; &#62; monsters as well.  :)  
&#62;    What are you trying to say???  ;-)  Personally, I can only cast 3
&#62; sc's on a full mana globe--is that worth it?  Prob, I guess.

That's an easy question to answer.  If the potential damage from not
stoning costs more than the 42 or so mana the spell costs, then 
stone.  :)

I use mana shield so when I'm up against knights that do like 120 
damage in one swing, the decision to stone or not is a no-brainer.
The only time I don't stone is when they're far enough away that I 
can pick them off before they get too close (or if they're vulnerable 
to fireball :).
