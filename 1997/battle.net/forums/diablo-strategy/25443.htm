&#62;      I really can't believe some of the butchered English that gets 
&#62; posted on this forum.  Note that I am not talking about people who 
&#62; don't speak English as their native language - hats off to them for 
&#62; posting at all in a foreign language.  I'm complaining about the 
&#62; people who should, theoretically at least, know better.  I'm also not 
&#62; talking about typos etc, since we all do that.
&#62; 
&#62;      The other day I posted something suggesting that &#34;your the 
&#62; moron&#34; was rather poor English, when someone replied insisting 
&#62; that &#34;your&#34; was correct.  Hello?  Did this person skip 
&#62; elementary school in its entirety?  For anyone who might be wondering 
&#62; what is wrong with &#34;your the moron&#34;, might I suggest a 
&#62; remedial course in contractions, and a careful study of the 
&#62; difference between &#34;your&#34; and &#34;you're&#34;.
&#62; 
&#62;      This is pretty basic stuff here...  It drives me up the wall 
&#62; when people who should know better do these kind of things 
&#62; (especially journalists).  I remember when Jeffery Dahlmer was 
&#62; caught, our local paper ran the headline &#34;Cannibal Killer 
&#62; Caught&#34; and my first reaction was &#34;which cannibals did he 
&#62; kill and why?&#34;
&#62; 
&#62;      I generally don't point out these types of mistakes unless the 
&#62; person is in the process of flaming me, then I just do it to further 
&#62; enrage them, but it still bothers me.  What the hell are we teaching 
&#62; in school if someone who is competent to use a computer is unable to 
&#62; differentiate between &#34;your&#34; and &#34;you're&#34;?
&#62; 
&#62;     Its a sad comment...
&#62; 
&#62; PS - Yes, I'm sure you can find a typo or two in my posts.  I'm 
&#62; certainly not claiming to be the authority on English grammar, but 
&#62; then I'd never insist that &#34;your the moron&#34; was grammatical.


Tempus,
  I've got to agree with you.  English is English, right.  What 
happened to it?  Poor grammar makes it even more difficult to 
decipher some of the crap that's posted.
