<pre>brett,

     I know, i already icq'd all my thoughts on the post to you, but 
i think they should be layed out here for all to see, as i think it 
provides a welcome solution to the debate.
    First of all, let me state that my conclusion is that all the 
classes are the best class to play, it comes down to a matter of your 
personal preference, and what is needed in the group.
    I'm going to start with the one class that has been mostly left 
out of this discussion, the warrior. We all know the big guys have it 
rough down in the lower sections with the mages and the witches 
running away and using ld attacks on them, and that archers on 
earlier levels can also reek havoc on them when they are low level, 
but thats a part of the game. and those long distance attackers that 
run are easier handled by rogues and mages is not doubt, but thats 
why the game is multi player, the warrior goes in with a mage or 
rogue, and they take care of ld attacks, and the warrior handles the 
close quarters stuff. Who can deny that a warrior surrounded by 
knights actually has a chance of surviving in the thick of the fray 
better than a mage or rogue? so having a warrior along to wade into 
the close quarters guys and start hacking is a good thing, and the 
mage and rogue can sit back and pick off while the warrior slashes. 
Here is a point where a mage is a bad thing, a mage's best spells are 
very limited in close quarters with other players, and they get 
limited to the less offensive spells when the warrior is in the thick 
of things, but that again is a part of the game, when they start 
clearing the ld attacks, they can unleash, but they need to take a 
back seat to the warrior when dealing with close quarters monsters. 
this is a point where the rogue is more potent, they can stand back 
and fire into the lump surrounding the warrior with more assurance 
that they are doing more good then bad.
     ok, that wasn't all about the warrior, but it gave a few very 
good points, the warrior can handle the knights and snakes easier 
then any other class in close quarters, true the other classes can 
pick them off before they become a threat, but that doesn't always 
work, so it's nice to have a warrior along to handle that stuff.
     on to the mage. I do have to admit, the mage is the heavy 
artillery, nothing can clear a room like a mage with his ability to 
do large amounts of damage to multiple targets, but if that mage runs 
into a gaggle of knights, they are in trouble, no matter what the 
brettmeister says, a mage stands a risk of getting hacked to pieces 
when surrounded. A mage is truly at his element dealing with large 
groups of long range attackers, they stay put and take the abuse that 
he flings at them liberally and plows them over. nothing stands long 
in the face of a mage, but if it closes in, it can do alot of damage. 
and yes, contrary to popular belief, a mage can effectively work in a 
team environment. The mage has alot of spells that work great in 
group games, stone curse, heal other, blood star and bone spirit come 
to mind as good multiplayer spells. when the party runs into a group 
of close range creatures, the mage can sit back, throw stone curse 
around to slow the attacks on the warriors, throw heal other to help 
the warrior conserve some healing potions, and cast blood star and 
bone spirit as relatively effective, non-teammate threatening, long 
range attacks. Its true that blood star and bone spirit don't do 
enough damage to be truly great spells, but they don't hurt other 
players any more then a rogue's arrow in that if it isn't targetted 
at them, it isn't going to do damage to them. Now, in this respect, 
yes, you are making the mage into a sort of cleric, but the mage is 
the most difficult to play in multi player, and needs to do alot of 
spell switching to be effective, and the mages heavy hitting spells 
do come into play, when you come up to a room full of witches or 
mages, that is when the mage gets to unleash and haul off with 
fireball and chain lit, wreaking massive amounts of damage all 
around, but you must first have experienced players who know to clear 
a room when the mage is gonna go to work.
     and, i saved the best for last, the rogue. I say the best, but 
that is just my personal opinion, and as you can see, i have fairly 
supported the other classes. The rogues dexterity, and bow use make 
her indispensible in multi or solo. Long range attacks with no worry 
about immunitys or about backlash killing other players, what a 
wonderous thing. the rogue is great to use in multi player. the rogue 
can give sniper like support to the warrior who is engaged heavily in 
battle, and also packs enough magic to send off a few heal others and 
stone curses to help the warrior out, and doesn't have to worry about 
which spell to pick to nail the monsters without hurting her freinds, 
because she has her trusty bow to fling the arrows around. True, the 
rogue doesn't want to get into close quarters with multiple monsters, 
the same as the sorcerer, but the rogue does have enough fire power 
to hit the monsters, and enough magic to retreat from a bad situation 
with stone curse or teleport, and with a high ac, she can be very 
elusive, and has the best chance of getting away from the fight. In 
the long range situations, The rogue is extremely useful, get the 
resistances up to max, and just wade in and start picking. with max 
resistances, the spells aren't doing enough damage to pick you off 
fast, and the mages/witches won't run away from your ranged attacks 
like they will the warriors short range ones, so they just sit there 
and take it as you pick them off slowly.
       well, I believe that I have proven that all three classes are 
relatively equal in ability to play in groups, but these stratedgies 
are mainly designed for warrior/mage or warrior/rogue, change the 
combos and things get different. mages working together or rogues 
working together, or alone for that matter, need to take things 
really slow to avoid getting swamped by the close range monsters, and 
warriors playing alone or in groups are gonna have to do alot of 
chasing. A good mage/rogue combo also consists of the mage unleashing 
the heavy artillery, and the rogue laying cover fire to keep the mage 
clear of a swamp.
      any way you slice it up in my opinion, the charachters are 
quite equally balanced, and each has strengths and weaknesses, and as 
i stated earlier, it comes down to a matter of personal preference, 
do you like to make things go boom, hack and slash, or to pick things 
off with stealth and cunning?
      as i said, my personal preference is the rogue, followed by the 
warrior, and a distant third is the mage, but that is my personal 
preference, and, I believe, doesn't show in my post.

&#62; 
&#62; TO DARKSNIPER:
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, Darksniper, true, a rogue CAN cast spells...BUT...as I and ME 
&#62; ALONE have come to recognize, the rogue is much much worse with magic 
&#62; then the mage (this is from my own experience).  First of all, my 
&#62; mage has..hmm...ATLEAST 4 times as much mana.  Also, my mage has 250 
&#62; hit points.  True, a mage CAN get pinned back before he has a chance 
&#62; to shoot a fireball, but fireballs can be shot out with suck ease, 
&#62; suck carelessness, that often it beats the baddies.  If nothing else, 
&#62; it is JUST as fast as your bows.  BTW...how many chain lightnings can 
&#62; u get off as a rogue, for I can only get like 4 pushes of the button 
&#62; off!  Whereas my mage can get, well, atleast 16 pushes (4 times).  
&#62; 
&#62; About the not comparing stats because I am level 40..I don't really 
&#62; think it makes too much of a difference, because I maxed my stats out 
&#62; around level 36...'cept vit (needed 2 more at lvl 36).
&#62; 
&#62; Anyways, keep your petty excuses of why the rogue is better coming :)</pre>
