<pre> Ok...I may seem a little obsessed here, but I can't let it die, so 
here we go. 
 
 Godly Full Plate CAN be purchased.

 Kalibos (the first) wears Godly Full Plate of the Ages (yeah, I 
know, it's probably duped...I didn't know at the time I traded for it 
and am working on fixing that...).  I went to Gris to see how much it 
sells for-he offered 42511 gold, which translates into a buying price 
of 170044 gold.  Now, seeing that one can only carry 170k without 
filling the last six slots, this armor would be unbuyable.  However, 
it is over by only 44 gold, which seems like it would be easy to 
whack off the end without a problem (meaning gris is being generous). 
 
 Kalibos went to a few games looking for plate.  I found a suit of 
Full Plate of the Ages at Griswold in one, and he was asking 33100 
gold for it.  
 I then started a game with Aelia, a level 32 rogue.  I found a suit 
of magical full plate in normal hell.  I tried to sell it before it 
was ID'd (damn good thing I kept it, it turned out to be Saintly 
Plate of the Stars, +129, +10 all!), and he was going to give me 1625 
gold, which means that Magical Full Plate of nothing would sell for 
6500 gold.  
 Here comes the assumptions I made-  

Godly Full Plate of the Ages sells for 170044
Full Plate sells for 6500
Full Plate of the Ages sells for 33100
The Ages suffix on Full Plate adds 26600 to the price

ergo, Godly Full Plate of nothing would sell for 143444 gold, which 
is well into the realm of affordable.

Please reply if you have contradictory evidence
