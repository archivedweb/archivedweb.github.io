<pre>Each monster has a &#34;base&#34; experience that they would give a 
level 0 character.  Each monster has another number that is 
multiplied by your level to determine the experience you get from it. 
 That is why as you gain levels you can get less experience from 
enemies.  But you cannot get negative experience from an enemy.   
Obviously the monsters in nightmare and hell dificulties have  a 
higher exp &#34;base&#34;.

The most experience you can receive from a monster is 8000.

But I have noticed something else....My level 30 rogue received about 
5000 exp from a nm/hell soul burner, while my lv 40 warrior received 
about 7800.

The experience is given to each character who gives damage to the 
enemy.  There is no reason to foolishly run into a room if you are 
&#34;close to your level up&#34; or just greedy for experience.  This 
factor makes great sense for ranged-attackers to level up quickly.  
The experience you get is the full-amount you would get if you killed 
the monster yourself.

Stone cursing DOES NOT GIVE EXPERIENCE.  I say for all those mages 
who stone cursed a horde and want experience too, teleport in and 
take a hack each creature.  

The best place to get experience is nightmare/hell.  Even though it 
is slower than hell/cats, you can find worthwhile items.  Hell/hell 
is for those players looking for a &#34;challenge&#34;.
