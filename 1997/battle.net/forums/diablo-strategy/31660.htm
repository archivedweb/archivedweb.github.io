<pre>&#62; I started a Hell mode game, and started down into hell. A short while 
&#62; later I hear some plate mail fall out. I run over and check it, Plate 
&#62; of Structure. I figured until I found something better to sell, I 
&#62; would keep it in my inventory. About 3 min later on the same level, I 
&#62; hear another set of plate mail fall. I check it, again Plate of 
&#62; structure! I picked them both up and compared. They were EXACTLY the 
&#62; same! Even Dur, stats ect were exactly alike. I dropped both (they 
&#62; stayed) then continued on.

I've had this happen several times.  It seems that the random item 
generator gets 'stuck' sometimes, or likes things of a certain 
prefix/suffix so much that you get stuck with two of them.  I bet for 
the armor you found, the amount that the durability was worn out was 
the same.

I used to (in version 1.02 or 1.03) sometimes see Gris selling the 
exact same items as well.  I think this might have been called a 
'bug' by blizzard and fixed.  But it does still happen in the dungeon.
