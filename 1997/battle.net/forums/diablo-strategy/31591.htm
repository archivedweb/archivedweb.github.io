<pre>I want to clarify a few things here.

        First of all, it's 5 in the morning, I'm tired, but so 
annoyed at a trend I see developing here that I have to speak out! 
Cheating in any of it's forms is not acceptable to me, and that is 
why I only play in my guild.

        Cheating is defined, in my book, as doing anything that is 
not an INTENTIONAL part of the game. This means abviously that all 
hacks and trainers are cheating, as well as duping, because although 
it can be done within the game without the use of an external 
program, it wasn't placed there intentionally.

        Two things I don't see as cheating that I have seen listed 
here as cheating are, backing charachters up, and trading. First of 
all, I have seen this said a number of times, and I agree, Blizzard 
did not intend for system crashes and hd crashes to be a part of the 
game. I haven't actually used a backup program successfully yet (not 
for lack of trying) so i'm innocent whether it is cheating or not, 
but I do not think it is cheating. Second of all, I play in a legit 
league, with other legit players, then trading is not cheating, it is 
a way of life. If i find a dreamflange with my rogue, and my buddy 
the mage finds a windforce, you can believe we'll trade! But then, I 
have no fear that the item I am accepting is legit, because I know 
the people I trade with, and play with them frequently.

       Yes, I realize I am seeing black and white here, but that is 
the way I see the issue. You either cheat or you do not cheat, there 
is no middle ground, And I personally do not play with charachters 
that are cheated in any way.

       Now I realize that Darksniper is going to disagree with me on 
this one, but I also believe that recieving items from players well 
over your charachters level is another form of cheating, and is 
almost as bad as the rampant duping out there. In my guild we follow 
a 3 level trading rule, because otherwise the characther at the other 
end of the trade may be getting an item that is totally out of 
possibility for a charachter of his level to obtain legitimately. 
When the items a charachter is using far outclass the charachter, 
then the player is playing the item, not the charachter, and that is 
not the way the game was meant to be played.

      All you cheaters out there who are thinking, hey, it's my 50 
bucks, I'll play the way I want to play, YES, it is your 50 bucks, 
and I am not going to tell you you can't use your cheat programs, but 
don't use them with me. I believe that diablo is a game that just 
can't get boring, so I don't accept that excuse, the other one I 
despise is that the person can't win without them. That is bull, they 
just need a few more hours of practice, and they'll be able to handle 
the situation with little or no problem, and beyond that, Diablo is 
meant to be a challenge! if there was no challenge, there would be no 
fun! To me, these are the same kind of people who said,&#34; I'll 
never use physics in my real life, if they're going to force me to 
take it, then why shouldn't I cheat?&#34; only in this case it is 
worse, because no one is forcing you to play diablo. And to the final 
class of cheater out there, the cheater who cheats just to annoy 
people, I have little to say about this group of people except that 
they are a$$h@le's who deserve to be drug out into the street and 
shot for ruining the game that I spent my hard earned money on. I 
bought this game, and I should be free to enjoy it, and this class of 
cheater ruins my fun!@#^&@

        Let me summarize by saying that I will never be reconciled 
with the cheaters of the diablo world, and that if I could get rid of 
all the hack and cheat programs out there, I would!

        

time for a quick plug, If you agree with me, then the guild I am in 
may be for you, check us out, <a href="http://www.aodh.com/">http://www.aodh.com/</a> . We're always 
looking for a few good legit players.
