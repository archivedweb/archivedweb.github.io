&#62; Yesterday is the luckiest day since I've played Diablo. I've found 3 
&#62; unique items in a solo normal/hell, they're a royal circlet, a 
&#62; windforce and a naj's light plate. Sure, my lv30 rouge equiped them 
&#62; all immediately. After that I could make a good trip to kill Diablo 
&#62; in nightmare/hell. Today I played hell difficulty and planned to get 
&#62; a third dot for my rouge. Unfortunately, my rouge was killed by those 
&#62; f...... advocates in lv15. I immediately press esc and was about to 
&#62; choose &#34;restart in town&#34;, but, somehow, I selected &#34;new 
&#62; game&#34;! When I realized, it's too late and I could do nothing. 
&#62; That's how I lost all my stuff: a royal circlet, a naj's light plate, 
&#62; a wind force, an obsidian ring of heaven, an obsidian amulet of 
&#62; giant, and a ring of heaven. I'm exhasted to think that I have to 
&#62; spend a loooong time to search for such good items again. And now my 
&#62; rouge has only some not identified junks! What should I do? Any 
&#62; suggestions, or at least some words to cheer me up?
&#62; 
&#62; Thanks,
&#62;

      Dam I realy feel bad for you. If I had my char backed up I''d 
be thinking of restoring. I dont have the utility so I couldn't but 
I'd sure be thinking about it. I have been searching for winforce for 
a long while now with no luck so just finding it is a good thing. 
Naj's lite plate isn't all that great at your level (for a rogue). 
I'd buy the best items I could from Griz and take it slow in normal 
hell for  a while if I were you. Next time remember to cast an escape 
portal and RETREAT!!!!!!!!!  I feel so bad for you that I would give 
you my legit Naj's lite plate if it would make you feel any better. I 
have a wizzard I no longer play with that has it equiped. Repost if 
you want it.
