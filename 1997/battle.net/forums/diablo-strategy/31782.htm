&#62; well, this is starting to turn into a 24 hour debate between DS and 
&#62; co. vs. Code. 

pls dont say they r on my side. im not the leader of anything. yes i 
have a clan but not everyone is in it. so dont put everyone as being 
on my side.

&#62; 
&#62; DS, u need to stop trying to tell the world not to cheat. let them go 
&#62; as they please. did u read Lorax's post on the continuum? it was the 
&#62; most truthful and logical explanation to cheating and legitamacy. 

sorry, but i ll continue to tell people legit is the way to go. read 
my reply to lorax's post and u ll understand. when i started, a lot 
of kind legit people told me all about cheaters. and now i m just 
returning the favor and helping newbies. now there is nothing really 
i can do to stop them. i cant put a gun to their head and say stop 
cheating. what i ve been doing is telling them whats bad about 
cheating.

&#62; 
&#62; If a newbie wishes to cheat,  then who gives a crap! let him cheat. 
&#62; hes the one wasting $50 on a good game because he will get bored of 
&#62; diablo in a couple of weeks. and then maybe after hes gets bored, 
&#62; he'll realize that diablo will be fun again if he doesnt cheat.

but dont u think the game would be better if he or she had never 
cheated? think about it, if i once own an obs ring of zod, a gpow... 
and now i have all these crap, yes i m legit but it sux. well this 
does not apply to everyone so dont quote me on this. but why start 
when u know its gonna ruin the game?

 he 
&#62; will then hopefully turn away from cheating for good. a gain for u!
&#62; 
&#62; Another thing, why dont u at least respect Code for admiting he 
&#62; cheats?

nope. read his post down there. and u ll know more about code and me. 
i used to respect him, but not after the post he made down there. 
btw, i stoped respecting him for his words not because he cheated.

 Have u ever looked at the view of cheating from Code's point 
&#62; of view? teleporting gets u across town faster, big deal (i dont 
&#62; really consider this cheating because it does not enhance the 
&#62; charater itself, it wont help him succeed in the game).

how can u not consider this a cheat? if this isn't a cheat i dont 
know what a cheat is. the use of teleporting in town means u save 
time on getting to wirt or gris or the witch. now its not a little 
time, it a lot of time there, and it is a big deal. think about it, 
blizzard made  them far apart for a reason. so that u need time to go 
to each one of them. now if u say time shouldnt be a factor, then 
what happens if i use gods mode to increase level? it saves time. or 
duping money to buy an item? it saves time.

many other 
&#62; examles like that. What drove Code to cheat, have u ever wondered 
&#62; that? why dont u ask him, then u might understand why he cheats?

he cheated because he wanted to save time by using teleport. and what 
about the gpow that he brought over from the single player game? is 
there a reason for that?

&#62; 
&#62; Now, dont get me wrong, im not taking sides. i dont like the fact 
&#62; that Code does cheat, but at least he admits it. DS is a non cheater, 
&#62; i like that too. DS, u got your guild nice and large by now,

its not that large i can tell u.

 and i 
&#62; commend u on that. it full of legit players, very good. keep it up! 
&#62; but dont start trying to change people. let them be they way they 
&#62; want to be. u will never change the entire diablo world to legit.

of course i wont. but after i helped a newbie to become legit, and he 
or she appreciates it, i can say, damn i did something good today. i 
cant change the whole bnet, but at least i tried my best and saved 
one players money.

&#62; 
&#62; Now, i left my e-mail up there for u to e-mail me if u have comments, 
&#62; not to flame me. but, i dont go a &#60;bleep&#62; if u do. 
&#62; 
&#62;  i meant not to insult u, but to simply comment on u (a simple 
&#62; critique). Find your place in the continuum and stay there (i love 
&#62; that post Lorax!).

i dont see any insult in ur post. is mearly a different point of 
view. now, do i have such a bad rep? why does everyone thinks that i 
ll flame them after they disagree with me? hell no. i flame people i 
dont like and cheaters.

&#62; 
&#62;  just for the record, i only am not legit on one of my charaters, the 
&#62; rest r fully legit. Nobody's post convinced me to start fully legit 
&#62; charaters, i convinced myself (hint, hint DS). 

good for u, but for the record i also changed a lot of cheaters in 
the beginner channel. i help them out and take some time to explain 
to the newcomers that legit will make ur game better. now again, i 
dont force them, i let them choose.



DarkSniper

p.s. dont take this personally, but if u want to comment on me next 
time, read my reply to that post as well. than i would be easier for 
me to explain myself to u. thx!</pre>
