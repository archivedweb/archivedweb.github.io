&#62; &#62; Here are my opinions on cheating, I appreciate feedback on whether or 
&#62; &#62; not you people agree, or disagree with my thoughts, so here goes:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1.)  Using any program that alters your character IS cheating (ex:  
&#62; &#62; raising exp, gold, stats, spell levels, or adding items)
&#62; 
&#62; agree ( i think this is the only this i agree with u.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2.)  Backing up/Restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating, and 
&#62; &#62; I am not going to use the old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse.  In 
&#62; &#62; single player Diablo, if you get your ass whipped by some demons, all 
&#62; &#62; you have to do is restore from your last save, well, there is NO 
&#62; &#62; reason that multiplayer should be any different, especially with the 
&#62; &#62; added risk of pkillers, and the like.
&#62; 
&#62; hell no. blizzard made multi player saves automaticly for a reason. 
&#62; and if u lose it to a pk or to monsters, then thats too bad. u cant 
&#62; get it back, if u do, then u r cheating. backing up for system crash 
&#62; is ok.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3.)  Transferring characters to/from single player and multiplayer is 
&#62; &#62; NOT cheating.  If the character has not been altered by external 
&#62; &#62; programs, or hacked in some way, then this transfer is perfectly 
&#62; &#62; legitimate, after all, why should someone spend weeks, building up a 
&#62; &#62; single player character, just to find out that if they want to play 
&#62; &#62; multiplayer, then they will have to start all over from level 1!
&#62; 
&#62; of course it is. there r tons of items u ll only find in single and 
&#62; not in multi. therefore it is definitly cheating. there is no legit 
&#62; gfpow in multi game but it is possible in singles. there r a lot of 
&#62; uniques u can only find in singles. now if u bring all that in to 
&#62; multi, ur character would be a cheat. 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 4.)  In multiplayer games, high-level players, giving things to lower 
&#62; &#62; level characters is alright, IF they are normally obtainable by that 
&#62; &#62; lower level player, such as a level 20 rouge, giving a level 5 
&#62; &#62; warrior a few healing potions, but it should not be takken too far!  
&#62; &#62; Such as giving a plate of armor that the lower level character would 
&#62; &#62; not have access to for levels to come.  I am sick and tired of seeing 
&#62; &#62; extremely low level characters such as levels 1-12 having Godly 
&#62; &#62; plates of the Whale, and Obsidian rings of the Zodiac, and Dragon's 
&#62; &#62; amulets of the zodiac, and King's swords of haste, these things are 
&#62; &#62; EXTREMELY rare and should not be found untill really high levels, I 
&#62; &#62; get on B-net all the time, and I always see this, level 1-12 people 
&#62; &#62; having better equipment than me (level 16 Warrior), and you know 
&#62; &#62; someone just gave it to them.
&#62; 
&#62; ur gpow and other items r all hacked or duped anyways, so accepting 
&#62; it would be non legit. it is not cheating for a high level to give 
&#62; good stuff to a low level. it is not the best to do, but it is not 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 5.)  Dupping IS cheating.  If people did not dupe, then the problem 
&#62; &#62; in #4 would not exist, if King's swords of haste were as rare as they 
&#62; &#62; SHOULD be, NOBODY would be giving them away.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; doh
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 6.)  Also, using a program such as a Trainer, that can grant immunity 
&#62; &#62; to other players attacks is NOT cheating (unless dueling of coarse) 
&#62; &#62; because of the vast number of dumbshit PKers that are out there, one 
&#62; 
&#62; what? r u ok? or r u just a newbie? how is that not a cheat? pk is 
&#62; part of the game, and if u play in a public game, then u should watch 
&#62; ur back. if u dont wanna be killed, join a clan or play in private 
&#62; rooms. using gods mode is definitly a cheat in ANY circumstances.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; HAS to protect oneself.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I appreciate you time and efforts of reading this, and possible 
&#62; &#62; posting of a response.  I am in no way shape or form showing 
&#62; &#62; disrespect to anyone, or out to offend anyone, so I hope I have not 
&#62; &#62; done so.
&#62; 
&#62; nope u didnt offend me and i hope i didnt offend u as well. but i 
&#62; cant gurantee the other replies (if u get any) would be the same.
