<blockquote>
<pre>Very interesting survey and discussion in all the posts (I didn't 
read 
them before posting but I did read them afterwards).  And thanks 
for summarizing the results.

And now, a couple of comments on your own answers . . . 


&#62; #2). &#34;accept Items&#34;
&#62; This is not cheating as long as the item is legit. It may ruin the 
&#62; players fun though.
&#62; 
&#62; #3). &#34;higher level chars buy items&#34;
&#62; This is a grey area. You cannot access something so you are having 
&#62; others access it for you. To this I would have to say, No, not 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #4). &#34;elixers?&#34;
&#62; This is again like #3, a grey area. I cringe to give elixers to 
&#62; people below level 26 as blizz did not intend for them to get them at 
&#62; that level... I lean towards a YES here.

I agree with you on 2 and 3, but while I agree that giving elixers to
low level players may be a bad idea, it is not cheating.  How is it
different from 2 or 3 except in the nature of the item being given?
And borrowing your portal argument below, if Blizzard did not want
low level characters to benefit from elixirs, it simply could have 
made them ineffective (this appears to be an artifact of the 
development of the game as a single player game, where a player
would not be able to get elixirs from any other source than
Adria, who would not sell them until level 26).  

Please explain the difference between 2, 3, and 4, and how 4 fits
within your definition of cheating but 2 and 3 do not.


&#62; 
&#62; #5). &#34;clear levels&#34;
&#62; Not cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #6). &#34;shopping&#34;
&#62; Absolutely is cheating. I think this is bending the rules of Diablo 
&#62; to restart hundreds of games in order to &#34;ramdomly&#34; get an 
&#62; item you wish. What is the difference between this and restarting 
&#62; games until you get one with &#34;easier&#34; creatures to get your 
&#62; exp? It is cheating (and I'm guiltly of it)

I agree with you on 5, but not on 6.  To answer your hypothetical, 
there is no difference between restarting games to get easier 
creatures and restarting to get different items.  Neither is cheating 
(as I reasoned in my reply to your survey, starting a new game is a
part of the game design, and your intent in restarting is irrelevant).
Again, please explain how this fits within your definition of 
cheating. 
In particular, please answer the hypothetical questions I asked in
my reply, such as when can you restart without it being cheating? 
Do you have to clear all 16 levels?  Is is cheating to start a game
to do a Laz run (i.e., ignoring all but levels 13-15)?  Is is cheating
for a low level character to complete the lower levels of the 
dungeons (i.e., church and cats) without completing or attempting
to complete the more difficult levels? 

&#62; 
&#62; #7). &#34;use Deye&#34;
&#62; It is a cheat as it is an external program used to access something 
&#62; not availible in the spec of the game. However, I use it from time to 
&#62; time.
&#62; 
&#62; #8). &#34;lower players to portal&#34;
&#62; Not cheating. Blizz could have restricted players of too low a level 
&#62; from entering the portal.
&#62; 
&#62; #9). &#34;only purpose is to hold extra items?&#34;
&#62; I feel VERY strongly about this... IT IS CHEATING. I look at it like 
&#62; this, you are given a unique inventory space you have to fit items 
&#62; into within the game. You have to manage your inventory space to 
&#62; determine what items you intend to carry, what you have to give up 
&#62; etc. If blizz wanted you to have a zillion items, they would have 
&#62; given you inventory &#34;pages&#34; to fill up. Nope, blizz gave a 
&#62; static inventory space. Using other chars to expand this space is 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #10). &#34;transfer items&#34;
&#62; Not cheating because if you find an item and it's legit, you should 
&#62; be able to put it on another char that you use as long as that char 
&#62; is *NOT* just a char to hold the item.

I agree with you on 10 but not on 9.  Again, what is done is exactly 
same in both cases, and I consider both to not be cheating.  It 
appears that intent plays some role in your definition of cheating.
Please explain how you approach this question.

Once again, thanks for a stimulating post.
