&#62; I was very surprised of the counts calling backup not cheating. It is 
&#62; an external program. Some claim its a conveinance over manual file 
&#62; copying. The thing which drives me to call this a cheat is the 
&#62; temptation to use a backup restore is always there as long as there 
&#62; is a backup. I would venture that many people using this only for 
&#62; 'system crash backups' use it also for pkill backups and for other 
&#62; intractable situations which they equate to system crashes. *CHEATING 
&#62; IN RESPONSE OT CHEATING IS CHEATING*. If you play a roguelike game 
&#62; like ADOM, backing up your save files is clearly cheating, as the 
&#62; game intentionally deletes your file during play. Diablo is not ADOM 
&#62; but it does have a roguelike heritage.

How do you figure? I see nothing particularly rogue-like. You can't 
permanently die, the character stats are simplified d&d, not anymore 
rogue-like than a hundred other games.

&#62; I have yet to have a system 
&#62; crash kill/erase any of my characters, and I have a lot of hours in. 
&#62; It seems to me if you have frequent system crashing problems that 
&#62; warrant the use of backups, the proper course of action is to resolve 
&#62; the system crashing problem. I had a RAM mismatch problem which was 
&#62; crashing the hell out of me with invalid page faults, which I 
&#62; resolved by removing the incompatable RAM banks.
&#62; 

But now with bnet, the Internet is part of the system. It crashes a 
lot.
Not something you can fix yourself, either.

...

&#62; The only objective view of cheating is that any 3rd party program is 
&#62; cheating. Abuse of bugs is a gray area, but in general I would lump 
&#62; abuse of bugs in with cheating since bugs were not intended to be in 
&#62; the game. Anything else is legit play.

Sounds pretty subjective to me.

&#62; 
&#62; Nice discussion Code Myster, Zamp and others.

I use DiabloBackup to backup my chars prior to playing any bnet game. 
bnet is *way* too unstable. I've lost lots of stuff to lag which I 
replace from my backup. I'd be happy to *not* have to do this, but 
until Blizzard designs bulletproof comms,*I'm* backing up.

Cheating? Sure, because Blizzard designed lag into the game. ;)
