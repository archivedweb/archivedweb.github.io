<pre>I have played Diablo for a long, long time now.  I have put many 
hours into the game, and I must say that I still am not tired of it.  
I want to address a couple of things I see on battle.net that bother 
me though.  First of all, I would like to make a plea to those of you 
that feel the need to express personal issues, like racism or sexual 
preference, on battle.net.  The only thing you are really doing is 
showing your own ignorance...there are only three types of people in 
Diablo:  sorcerors. warriors, and rogues.  Please do everyone a favor 
and keep your personal issues out of the game.  Also, keep in mind 
that battle.net does not censor itself, so see that you censor 
yourself before you decide to type things you know are not 
appropriate for public channels.  Secondly, there is a lot of 
controversy about hacking and cheating.  I'm not going to make a 
judgement on whether it's right or wrong to hack...I will simply say 
this:  what keeps me interested in this game and what separates it 
from others of its kind is the incredible variety.  There are three 
different classes, and a practically infinite number of variations in 
gameplay.  I view hacking as another dimension to the game, and like 
any other element, you can choose to participate or totally isolate 
yourself from it.  There are still players who don't hack and play 
the game in its pure form, and there are guilds that don't hack or 
dupe at all.  Realize that you will encounter those that hack, dupe, 
pkill, and rob if you are going to join public games or enter games 
with those you don't know.  As for me, I have several multiplayer 
characters.  Some are hacked, some are not.   I have been in pure 
guilds, cheating guilds, good guilds, and evil guilds.  There are 
players I have adventured with since we were newbies together, and 
almost every time I am on I find someone new to travel with.  It's 
this variety that keeps me playing, and combined with the intricacies 
of the game, I don't know if I'll ever get tired of playing Diablo.
Feel free to e-mail me if you want to express any opinions or if you 
just want to talk about the game...I will respond (if your message is 
at all interesting and valid)  :)

Peace,
B.J. Young
