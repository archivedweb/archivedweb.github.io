&#62; No offense to Lanhdanan, especially cause he just wrote this post to 
&#62; say thanks to others...
&#62; 
&#62; But what does he mean when he says:
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Darksniper: I wasn't even going to transfer my character until you 
&#62; &#62; said that you didn't consider it cheating. 
&#62; 
&#62; Is Lanhdanan talking about transfering a single-player character to 
&#62; multiplayer?  If so, I don't see how that it wouldn't be cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; If using a backup program to restore a multiplayer character after a 
&#62; MK is considered cheating, then restoring a single-player game after 
&#62; a MK (which all single-players legitimately do) becomes cheating when 
&#62; that player is transferred over to multiplay.  
&#62; 
&#62; Strictly speaking, the transferred single-player character just 
&#62; hasn't gained his/her points, levels and equipment in the same risky 
&#62; and difficult conditions that are faced by the multiplayer character.
&#62; 
&#62; If I have misunderstood or misinterpreted what Lanhdanan was talking 
&#62; about, then I apologize profusely: sorry for misunderstanding and 
&#62; getting involved in something I really don't know anything about.
&#62; 
&#62; However, if Lanhdanan is talking about a transfer from single- to 
&#62; multiplay, then I'd be interesting in talking more about why such a 
&#62; transfer would or would not be considered &#34;cheating&#34;.


  Here's the whole story.......

      I was playing diablo ( as usual ) the day of the gathering and 
as
 you all know time flies when having fun. I took a break from playing 
 and checked out the forum ( my fav.) and I seen D.S. 's post .
  It was 8:05 pm my time ( 7:05 pm yours ) and I still needed to 
install diablo into the system I was using. When that was done I 
thought I had lots of time ( 7:30 your time ). But when I went to 
play my multi char wasn't there ! Suck !! So I farted around till 
8:45 your time and still no luck. So I just went on b-net for help 
and voila you now know the rest of the story :)

   Sorry for the confusion.
    Landanan
