&#62; I would like to find someone interested in a challenge I have thought

&#62; 
&#62; I believe would be easy for me and my Rogue char, to clear Hell Hell 
&#62; by myself, WITHOUT armor! Hmmm maybe easy wasn't the correct choice 
&#62; of words.... but I think Armor really can be irrelevant in a Hell 
&#62; Hell quest.
&#62; 
&#62; I would restrict myself to: Bow, Amulet and 2 rings (potions and 
&#62; scrolls to of course). No extra cheats, items etc would be used.
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to attempt this with someone to see &#34;if&#34; it's 
&#62; possible or at least, how far someone can get. Sound interesting? 
&#62; Pure raw experience is nearly all you can count on. I will experiment 
&#62; with this a little tonight. 
&#62; 
&#62; At minimum I would like at least someone to tag along to 
&#62; &#34;verify&#34; how I do (I would agree at any time for the 
&#62; &#34;referee&#34; to say &#34;check&#34; or something and I would 
&#62; allow myself to get killed to verify no cheats or godmode).
&#62; 
&#62; I got thinking about this last night and for a challenge, would love 
&#62; to try it. I think Diablo would be hard and be time consuming as you 
&#62; can't hide from his apoc spell. Hmmmmm interesting!
&#62;

I think it sounds like a blast.  My level 39 mage has gotten to be 
rather boring as there isn't a major challenge or threat in any mode. 
 The +800 mana shield, level 17 fireball and stonecurse (for immune 
alls) makes the game rather easy.  Yes, I still die, but there is no 
threat of losing my equipment.  I go down naked and get it back.  In 
fact my mage has no back up equipment.  I'm definitely interested in 
attempting this with you.  I don't have any cheat programs and am not 
interested in getting them.  A rogue and a mage are a deadly 
combination.  For the all immunes, mage stones and rogue takes them 
out.  Anything not immune to fire is a sitting duck for the mage.  I 
have two friends that I often play with, but neither of them have the 
guts to go into hell/hell.  I have cleared hell/hell alone quite a 
few times.  Looking forward to doing it naked with a naked babe like 
the rogue.  Hopefully I will be able to keep my concentration on the 
Big D's monsters.  Should be a very mana intensive adventure.</pre>
