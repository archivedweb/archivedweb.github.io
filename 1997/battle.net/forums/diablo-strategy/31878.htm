<pre>I enjoyed starting a new Mage and playing to the Cats with a new 
group Diablo players.

We were on level 3 last night, me and two level 7 warriors and could 
not kill the King.  I did not have Holy Bolt(even went down a level 
to look for one)  and the witch was not coughing any.  But I swear, 
we would hack on his butt for an eternity until we ran out of health 
and mana, go back up, refuel, and come back down and do it again.  
This must have happend at least 4 to 6 times.  Still he would not die.

I was wondering if we leave the level to refuel, does the King's 
health get reset as well?  There are times that I can hit him with 
Holy Bolt, maybe 20 times and its over.  But hack him with a sword 
and you will be there for a long time.   

The two warriors finally gave up and call it a night.  I could not 
leave until that sack o bones was dead.   I ended up finding a mana 
shield scroll and sat in a corner with a majical charged bolt staff 
and FINALLY killed him.  He coughed up a jagged saber which I will 
give to one of the warriors tonight, when we continue our quest.  

If you made it this far, you are truly addicted to Diablo, and, like 
me, you anxiously await a sequel or expansion pack, similar to 
WarCraft2's where only the strong can survive.  

Good Hunting,
