<blockquote>
<pre>Since I have additional comments and questions for you both, based on 
the cheating survey results, I decided to start a new thread. (BTW, 
CM, did you notice that your survey was re-posted in Ogden's with 
several replies? You may want to update your results.)

CM, I admire the fact that you were willing to change your answer to
#10, both because of the fact that you are willing to change your mind
and because you are being consistent with your prior analysis.  

I agree with you, Lok, the fundamental question is how you define 
cheating.  You and I seem to have the same definition.  Compare the 
definition in your discussion:

   It appears that everyone has their own view on cheating. Many 
   people do not have a consistant view on cheating. Anyone can 
   create a whole big long laundry list of 'easy' tactics which 
   some might frown upon and call cheating. By defining cheating 
   in this subjective manner, you are heading for an inconsistant 
   view on cheating.

   The only objective view of cheating is that any 3rd party 
   program is cheating. Abuse of bugs is a gray area, but in 
   general I would lump abuse of bugs in with cheating since bugs 
   were not intended to be in the game. Anything else is legit play.

with my definition of cheating given in my reply to CM (and earlier 
posts) (although I do not think the use of internal anomalies or bugs 
not intended to be in the game is a gray area; I consider it to be
cheating).  And I think, CM, that this is probably fairly close to 
your definition as well.

I do not include the phrase &#34;to gain an (unfair) advantage&#34; 
in my
definition of cheating because this incorporates intent in the 
definition, which I prefer not to do.  First, I want to keep the 
definition as objective as possible, and leave the subjective value
judgments for later (e.g., is the cheating harmful, justified, etc.?).
Second, incorporating intent/advantage into the definition seems to 
encourage inconsistency.  I believe that the identical pattern
of behavior should be considered a cheat regardless of what the 
intent was.  Third, is raises the question of what can be considered 
an 
advantage?  Is is an unfair advantage to duel when one person has a 
much faster computer or connection than another?  Perhaps, but it is
not cheating.

Now, let's get to specific cases:

&#34;Shopping&#34;  -  CM, your points are well taken in that 
&#34;shopping&#34; may reduce the challenge of the game, but I think 
that this incorporates 
the &#34;intent/advantage&#34; element that I leave out of my 
definition. There are many things that give someone an advantage, 
fair or unfair,
but as long as it is part of the game design and does not take 
advantage of a bug, it should not be considered cheating.  I believe
Lok discussed the difference between actions that are cheats and 
actions that reduce the challenge of the game (e.g., accepting items
from a higher level character) in a previous post.

I noticed that you brought up the idea of playing the game.  To me,
someone creates or plays the &#34;game&#34; when they create the game 
and 
appear in town.  To me, wandering through town and selling or buying
items is &#34;playing&#34; the game.  Defining it otherwise leads to 
tough
questions about when playing the game actually begins.  For example, 
CM, do you consider it cheating for someone to portal up and down 
repeatedly from the dungeon to cause Adria to get a new supply of
elixirs, books and staves?  Does it matter if that person does nothing
on the dungeon side except cast a new town portal and reenter it, or
do they have to kill something?  (BTW, some people seem to define the 
&#34;game&#34; more broadly than either of us to include the entirety 
of b.net and sometimes even this forum. This came up in the PK 
debates a few weeks ago.)

I also noticed that you distinguished between the Laz runs and 
shopping by the fact that Blizzard created a shortcut to get to Hell. 
First, this doesn't answer my question with regard to continuing on to
Level 16, since the same shortcut that leads to Laz leads to Level 
16. The difficulty in deciding where cheating begins and ends in this 
question is why I define cheating the way I do.  Second, isn't this 
somewhat inconsistent with our analysis of a lower level character 
porting to Hell?  Arguably, Blizzard didn't want that
character to use the Hell shortcut until he/she reached Level 13 
through the preceding 12 levels.  And third, Blizzard gave us the 
ability to start a new game at any time.  If it had wanted us to 
&#34;play&#34; the game before restarting, they simply could have 
removed that option until a dungeon had been entered, etc. (i.e., 
whenever the &#34;game&#34; had been &#34;played&#34; sufficiently).

Lok, I like your analysis of balancing the &#34;shopping&#34; aspect 
with the difficulty of the &#34;walks&#34; to Wirt and Adria.  While 
I still feel it would not be cheating even if all the &#34;shops&#34; 
were close together, this indicates to me that Blizzard took 
&#34;shopping&#34; into consideration as something people would do 
within the game.

&#34;Elixirs&#34;  - CM, you noted that you were leaning towards 
calling this a cheat because Blizzard had indicated that they did not 
want lower level characters to use them by limiting their ability to 
purchase them.  But isn't this also inconsistent with our analysis of 
a lower level character to Hell?  As discussed above, Blizzard seems 
to have indicated that lower level characters should not have a 
shortcut to Hell unless they went through the preceding levels.  
Blizzard could have stopped lower level characters from using the 
portal method to enter Hell, and similarly could have made elixirs 
ineffective for characters below Level 26.  

This also appears inconsistent with our analysis of &#34;middle-
man&#34; buying.  Blizzard seems to have indicated that lower level 
characters should not have the option of buying high level items by 
limiting their direct buying options.  But we agree that &#34;middle-
man&#34; buying is not a cheat.


&#34;MKing&#34; - Since we're discussing Blizzard's intentions, I 
have a new question to toss in the mix.  Blizzard appears to have 
desired to limit the &#34;rewards&#34; of PKing to some gold and an 
ear.  In beta, the victim also lost their equipped items, but this 
feature was removed for the commercial release.  MKing, of course, is 
the use of monsters and spells to cause the victim to lose their 
equipped items, and appears to be contrary to Blizzard's intent to 
limit the rewards of PKing.  Is this a game anomaly/bug that should 
be considered cheating?


Looking forward to your thoughts. . .

P.S.  CM, you have now twice mentioned a new bug that allows the use 
of certain spells in town.  What spells can be cast?  Does it require 
the use of any external programs?  What should I watch out for? Can 
it lead to a new era of TownKill?  (If, like me, you would hate to 
see a new cheat of this sort get widely known and/or abused, please 
feel free to email me at the above address.)</pre>
