&#62; &#62; &#62; Ok people.....  here's another one for you.   I'm a level 29 Warrior 
&#62; &#62; &#62; and am trying to get my spells up.  My Flame Wave is level 8 uses 20 
&#62; &#62; &#62; mana and does 174-228 damage.  I found an Arch-angels staff that I 
&#62; &#62; &#62; equipped (+2 to all spell levels) and saw that there was no change 
&#62; &#62; &#62; except in level (up to 10).  Is there a 'maximum level' for each type 
&#62; &#62; &#62; of character and spell??
&#62; &#62; &#62; 

I have discovered the same thing that you have about a pseudo-maximum 
level (even though it's common knowledge that the max is 15).  This 
pseudo-max level is that point where there is no apparent decrease in 
mana requirement, or damage inflicted (not insulting you, just making 
sure we're on the same page).  What I have discovered is that the 
damage (I'll use my favorite spell Chain Lightning as an example) was 
4-60, and after leveling up, it was 4-62 (can't remember the exact 
damage figures, but you get the point).  See if this works for you.  
I use a rogue, it may be different for a warrior, since warriors 
aren't as magically talented as the other two classes.

&#62; &#62; &#62; Does anyone know of a web page that goes into this type of detail?  
&#62; &#62; &#62; It is extremely annoying to pay like 12000 to buy a book that doesn't 
&#62; &#62; &#62; do anything except raise the level up one.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; What the heck are you using an AA staff for?  You are a *WARRIOR*, 
&#62; &#62; not a sorcerer.  Warriors suck and will always suck at magic.  If you 
&#62; &#62; want to use magic, use a sorcerer as a character.  There are a couple 
&#62; &#62; of spells that can be useful to a warrior (stone curse for one), but 
&#62; &#62; most of your spells will not be strong enough to do diddly to any 
&#62; &#62; monsters in the lower levels.  However, to answer your questions.  
&#62; &#62; Maximum spell level without using special equipment is 15.  Using 
&#62; &#62; equipment you can get your spells up to 20.  However, this is 
&#62; &#62; impossible for a warrior to do.  You can never get high enough in 
&#62; &#62; your magic attribute to read all the books.  And yes, a book will 
&#62; &#62; just raise the spell level by one.  
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok.......  I didn't explain myself quite well....   I found a staff 
&#62; of AA and equiped it before selling it to just see what my spells 
&#62; would be like if I read an additional 2 books for each.  Trust me, no 
&#62; warrior would be caught dead actually using a staff of AA.  My main 
&#62; question still stands...  what is the benefit of reading a book if 
&#62; the spells stats don't change.  Does it cast quicker?</pre>
