&#62; That's my take.  I'd like to hear others' opinions on group tactics; 
&#62; it seems a useful subject in a strategy forum. . . .maybe it's just 
&#62; me . . .

&#62; fight the good fight,

It is interesting that the class that probaly does best in a group of 
four is also the class that you could most easily do without in a two 
class group, the Rogue. The four rogues have the all skills to some 
degree.  The  two and two Wrriors and Sorcerors  have and unequalled 
ability to Stone and Kiill at an incredibly rapid rate. As for what 
it is best to have two of in a four class group I would go with the 
Warrior because he has the least negative impact on his party 
members, and two ranged attackers should be suffucient. If Golems did 
not fight among themselves my answer might be different because then 
we would be really talking about a party of eight and Sorcerors have 
much meaner Golems.

This is somewhat do the the rogue being a generalist while the 
Warrior and Sorceror are both specialists. Also the rogue wants to 
pick away at small groups while the Sorceror prefers blasting large 
groups to benefit from collateral damage.

As a two character combination I think the Warrior-Sorceror is the 
strongest, and most underappreciated.  The sorceror can fire away 
then hide behind the warrior and start stoning, while the warrior 
slices and dices.  The Rogue-Warrior operates on wa weaker version of 
the same principle dealing with dribbles rather than swarms.  The 
Rogue-Sorceror have operatioanal differences to work with Stone and 
Shoot will not be as fast as Blast-Chop-Stone-Chop. While the Warrior 
probably has the least raw power he also makes the best ally.
