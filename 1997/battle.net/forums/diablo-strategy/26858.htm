&#62; Greetings.
&#62; 
&#62; I am pleased my posting got some attention, since I was of the belief 
&#62; with all those cheaters out there, nobody would ever take me serious.

   First congrats on thinking up something really interesting, even 
if I am still dubious about whether you actually did this or not.  I 
wouldn't be so smug about &#34;cheaters&#34; though, since what you 
did by using hand-me-downs qualifies as cheating in most peoples 
books.

(snip)



&#62; So I prepared that challenge and bought as much infravision scrolls 
&#62; as he was able to carry. When I entered hell difficulty via a modem 
&#62; game with my level 18 warrior (who still had 10 points to distribute 
&#62; left but already vitality of 100), I had on a reserve plate, 8 
&#62; potions in the belt, 2 town portal scrolls and the rest was filled by 
&#62; infravision ones (about 30). My game creator left and I entered hell. 

     I'm sorry...  Where did you find 30 infravision scrolls?  The 
things are kinda rare...  Assuming you did the old, restart a million 
times until you can buy what you want from the witch trick, that's 
kinda cheating too...

(snip)

&#62; In level 16 it proved to be harder, for as on the one hand my stock 
&#62; of infravisions had been halfed, and I had forgotten to purchase a 
&#62; telekinesis book on the other. I went up to level 1 and 5 (got almost 
&#62; killed in 5, had to drink all potions, then escape) and searched for 
&#62; a staff of telekinesis or a book, but after about a quarter of an 
&#62; hour I reentered hell since I had no luck. So I had to make it the 
&#62; normal way. I now realized that if I was killed, I wouldn't stand a 
&#62; chance to get back my equipment. When I again made one false step, a 
&#62; blood knight got aware of me and started hitting, I needed to use 5-6 
&#62; potions (one after every hit), to kill him. Fortunately, I had more 
&#62; space for potions now, since I had used many of my infras.

     See now, this makes me a little suspicious, because if you had 
ever actually been to hell, you would have realized that you don't 
lose your equipment when you die on level 16...   Hmmmmmmm.

 
&#62; I proceeded and killed only if necessary, then opened the gate to 
&#62; diablo. I attracted the surrounding knights and ran away, then I went 
&#62; back to them and they didn't notice. It was fun. I killed about three 
&#62; Advocates blocking the way to diablo. Then I started swinging at him, 
&#62; and the poor guy neither knew what hit him nor inflicted even 1 hp of 
&#62; damage to me. After some time he died, and I had reached my goal.

     This doesn't explain how you could have gotten to the skull 
lever in the spiral room...  I sincerely doubt you could have snuck 
by all of those knights in that tiny corridor, and you certainly 
couldn't have killed all of them if you had trouble earlier with just 
one knight.

     Still, a pretty interesting idea...</pre>
