<pre>My favorites as a level 39 warrior:

Weapon/Warrior:  I have &#34;two&#34; favorites at this point.  I 
like using the Grandfather when I am just looking for pure damage, 
however, I find myself using the King's Sword of Speed that I found.  
I am sure the the KSOH would be even better, so I have to say that 
for the warrior, a non-unique is the way to go.

Armor/Warrior:  I have never used any unique armor for the warrior.  
In my opinion, AC is the only way to go here.  I use Awesome Full 
Plate.  I have yet to find any Godly plate, but am hoping...

Shield/Warrior:  I prefer to use Stormshield.  I like the AC and the 
fastest hit recovery.

Other/Warrior:  I go for the resistances here.  I am currently using 
a obs. amulet of the stars, emerald ring of the titans, and can't 
remember the other at this point...

&#62; Alrighty, I was just curious as to ALL the people who think that most 
&#62; uniques are USELESS.  NOW, don't get me wrong, there are a few that 
&#62; are undoubtedly the best weapons/armor..i.e.. Dreamflange is the best 
&#62; mage weapon, windforce/eaglehorn are two OF (not the two best) the 
&#62; best bows.  Now, being an experienced (don't even test me) Laz 
&#62; Runner, I have found ALMOST every unique in the game.  Noticeably, 
&#62; off hand, the biggest I have yet to find is Eaglehorn.
&#62; 
&#62; Q.  What uniques do you think are the best for each character and are 
&#62; there (In your opinion) any &#34;non uniques&#34; better than those 
&#62; uniques?
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, I guess this is the direction I would like this post to go in:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  State (what you believe) is the best item for THE CHARACTER THAT 
&#62; YOU ARE MOST EXPERIENCED IN for every weapon slot (read my answer for 
&#62; guidance) (i.e..dreamflange/mage, blah blah..etc. etc.)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; My answers:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Mage/Weapon:  I am a believer in the powers of a dreamflange.  
&#62; The greatest weapon(IMHO) for a mage...forget the PlentifulAAA staff 
&#62; (handy in tough situations though), dreamflange rules!  (BTW, what is 
&#62; the highest charged Apoc staff you've found?  Mine is 26 ad it was 
&#62; plentiful NOT bountiful err..one of em..now I forgot..grrr!)
&#62; 
&#62;     Mage/Armor:  Ac is unimportant to me, as it has had little effect 
&#62; in my mage's game so far.  I prefer Naj's &#34;Light&#34; Plate 
&#62; because of the spell increase (looking for another, because my other 
&#62; one broke...only found 2 of these little beauties so far).  If I 
&#62; couldn't have Naj's, I would want an Obsidean (mail, plate..doesn't 
&#62; matter) of Wizardry (of course I got rid of mine when I found 
&#62; Naj's..grrr..again)
&#62; 
&#62;    Mage/Shield (if nec.):  For a shield, I am looking for something 
&#62; to increase my &#34;needed&#34; stats, like resistance, because I 
&#62; have no need for AC, Stormshield is of little use.  I have and prefer 
&#62; an Emerald (or Obsidean, just happened to get one notch better) 
&#62; Shield of (anything)
&#62; 
&#62;    Mage/Helm:  I have thinking cap, which I think will be good once I 
&#62; have the patience to goto a &#34;hidden&#34; shrine and &#34;up&#34; 
&#62; the durabilty.  Otherwise, I have and would prefer Royal Circlet 
&#62; because (not only) does it have 40ac (of little importance) but it 
&#62; adds 60 mana (I think..uhh..15mag and 30 mana?).
&#62; 
&#62;    Mage/rings/amulets:  Ahh, the mighty rings and amulets.  These 
&#62; little (but powerful) item may look like normal items, but can boost 
&#62; your Mag or str etc. (amazingly!) up by quite alot (:)).  I prefer 
&#62; Obs. Am of Wizardry, A Ring of the Zodiac, and an Obsidean ring.  If 
&#62; you don't need more resistance adders as rings/or amulets, I would 
&#62; prefer (anything) of Widardry.
&#62; 
&#62; Blah!
&#62; 
&#62; Anyways, bordom unleashes my imagination, hope to here from you 
&#62; &#34;skilled&#34; characters, Blah!
&#62; 
&#62; Blah!
&#62;
