&#62;    You poor bastard.  Why did you let all that stuff lay there?!?!  
&#62; That's a dragon's hoarde of ultra-rare treasure!  You should have 
&#62; read my post (I think it's on index 4 or 5 now...July 10 entitled 
&#62; ***TIRED OF LOSING YOUR STUFF?**** or something like that).  You 
&#62; could have had it all back......SIGH.  What a shame.  I have played 
&#62; for several months and haven't come up with items like that.  Oh 
&#62; well, maybe you will be lucky again.  Good luck in recovery mon ami.

Saint,

    I did, in fact read your previous post about getting your stuff 
back.
And I have used similar tactics to get stuff back. But sometimes you
can die and loose all your stuff right near the stairway that leads
up to the previous level. So if you're not on one of the levels that 
has
3 stairs (i.e. levels 5, 9, and 13) then you can be really screwed!
    If you have a horde of guys waiting by the stairway in order to
gang bang you, you are in deep trouble. If you are in way over your
head, then you won't even have time to cast a teleport or phase or
something to get out of the way before they slaughter you. I think 
this
is what happened to Boots. I know Boots, and he is no dummy. If he
had any reasonable chance of getting his stuff back, he would have
managed to do it. This kind of thing happened to me and
my roommate once. But we refused to give up, and kept one computer
running for 4 days!!! in order to build up our characters to be tough
enough to get our stuff back. Unfortunately, by that time, we already
had to have some new, good equipment in order to liberate the old 
stuff.
So it was, in the big picture, hardly worth it.
   So, my point is; yeah it sucks to loose all your best stuff, but 
sometimes
you just have to say &#34;oh, well&#34; and start getting a set of 
new stuff. There
are always more cool items to be found.
