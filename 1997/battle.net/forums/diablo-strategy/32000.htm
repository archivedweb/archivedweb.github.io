<pre>Here's me happily thinking that maybe cheats to legits on b.net is 
fairly even numbers.  Then I open a Battle.net game with a new 
character of mine, simply called 'Level 8's and under'.  A total of 
six people joined my game throughout the time, and five of them were 
outright cheaters!  To make matters worse, two of these were insane 
dumbass PKs. 

 I think one of the cheaters was a guy who was like I used to be... 
given items by someone and thinking they were ok.  This guy had two 
Dreamflanges, one was a helmet and the other was a ring!  Very sad.  
I tried to make him understand what was going on, but it didn't work. 
 It was a very rude shock to me, anyway.  5/6 cheat.  I really hope 
that this is just bad luck and in no way representing the REAL 
proportions.  Cheating in single player is not really bad, but doing 
it in multiplayer is very unethical.

I think that it's sad that there are so many of them.  I bet if they 
learned to play properly, they'd have heaps more fun anyway.
