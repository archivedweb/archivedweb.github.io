<pre>I'm only a level 24 warrior but I managed to raise certain spells to 
a very high level thanks(?) to some shrines and +magic equipment.
The best ranged attack depends on the level of the warrior, the area 
you are playing in and of the monster(s) you are facing.
For instance:
Low level church: try using Charged Bolt and walk along with them, 
they provide a hell of a cover and you don't have to aim much. Even 
better they don't cost that much mana but will take out quite a lot 
of enemies. The area is wide enought o CB to have full effect.
 But you probably won't run into trouble until Catacombs or Caves. 
You have to take the resistance of every monster into account of 
course. A normal lightning bolt seems to work just fine for me in 
most cases. Acid spitters are indead annoying so if it's a pack I'll 
use Firewall. You should try standing directly behind the wall of 
fire so you block the monster from moving out of the flames. Very 
handy in Hell.
If the monsters can't reach you then I'd strongly suggest using a 
bow, doesn't matter what kind. I usually find one on every level I go 
to so that's no problem. As a Rogue once said: no monster is arrow 
resistant ;)
Then there is one last ranged attack I forgot to mention. The Golem!
Note that I didn't mention Chain Lightning or Fireball. They are both 
very nice but CL is a real mana drainer and FB is too slow.
I guess Firewall is numero uno. Anyway, if you got problems in a 
certain level or with certain monsters you can always mail me and 
I'll try to help out ;)
