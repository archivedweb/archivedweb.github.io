<pre>This post is just a question for all of you who know about the case 
of the person who got their 3rd dot with a level 18 warrior, legit.

He supposedly wore a ring of darkness, Gotterdamerung, and used 
infravision scrolls.  I have this comment.

My level 39 mage found NIGHTSCAPE which is an AC 15 cape which gives -
40&#37; light radius.  I used Nightscape with Gotterdamerung which 
gave me -80&#37; light radius total.  I also used a Kings sword of 
Haste (since dreamflange gives +20&#37; light radius).  Also used 
were rings of the heavens, amulet of the zodiac, and saintly sheild 
of the tiger.

The square I was standing on was completely lit up, and the 8 squares 
around me were 1/2 lit up, and everything else was pitch black 
(except for the infravision effects).  What happened is that I got my 
ass kicked.  The monsters saw me from several squares away (at least 
5 squares away in a direct line) and would attack me.  I want to know 
why.

Do the monsters 'see' you more easily if you have a high magic stat?  
Assuming that the warrior who told his tale about his 3rd dot was NOT 
lying, the monsters should not have been able to see me except for 
when they are 1, maybe 2 squares away.  There is NO WAY the warrior 
could have navigated through Hell/Hell without dying in a heartbeat 
if the monsters could see him as well as they were seeing my level 39 
mage.  So this brings up the following questions:

1.  Was the warrior who accomplished this feat wearing MORE than -
80&#37; light radius?  Was he at -100&#37;? I can't remember his 
exact items.  I know he used Gotterdamerung and a ring of darkness, 
at a minimum.

2.  Do the monsters 'see' you better based upon your level and/or 
magic statistic?

3.  Was the person who made the original post lying?  (If you didn't 
follow the original thread, be assured that most, if not all of his 
claims were wrung out to dry in this forum).  He was able to refute 
every arguement which would have 'defeated' his claim.

Anyone who can answer any of these 3 questions, please post.

Just curious,

Loki,
Legit level 40 mage (finally made it to 40!)</pre>
