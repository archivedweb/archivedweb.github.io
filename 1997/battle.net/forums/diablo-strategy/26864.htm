<pre>Alright, all you gullible fools, I'm going to tell you why this guy 
is a liar and a cheat.
Here are the facts.
1.) He says he is wearing Gotterdamnerung
2.) Gotterdamnerung requires 50 strength.
3.) His base strength is 30.
4) He says his strength is at 56 with items on.
5.) The only items he is wearing that add to strength are a ring of 
strength which gives +1 to +5 to strength, and a split skull shield 
which gives +2 to strength, which gives him a maximum addition of +7 
to strength, giving him a maximum of 37 strength.

Therefore,
1.) He is lying about his total strength.
2.) He is lying about wearing Gotterdamnerung (please also note that 
the Scav. Car. requires 40 strength, and he is also lying about this.)

Finally, 
Since he is lying about these two things, he is most likely lying 
about everything.

The only other possibility is that he is telling the truth, and he 
was actually wearing a ring of giants, not a ring of strength.  But I 
seriously doubt this since his claim is so ridiculous, and he cheated 
by having items he could never have obtained legitimately with that 
level of character anyway.

&#62; &#62; Greetings.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I am pleased my posting got some attention, since I was of the belief 
&#62; &#62; with all those cheaters out there, nobody would ever take me serious.
&#62; 
&#62;    First congrats on thinking up something really interesting, even 
&#62; if I am still dubious about whether you actually did this or not.  I 
&#62; wouldn't be so smug about &#34;cheaters&#34; though, since what you 
&#62; did by using hand-me-downs qualifies as cheating in most peoples 
&#62; books.
&#62; 
&#62; (snip)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; So I prepared that challenge and bought as much infravision scrolls 
&#62; &#62; as he was able to carry. When I entered hell difficulty via a modem 
&#62; &#62; game with my level 18 warrior (who still had 10 points to distribute 
&#62; &#62; left but already vitality of 100), I had on a reserve plate, 8 
&#62; &#62; potions in the belt, 2 town portal scrolls and the rest was filled by 
&#62; &#62; infravision ones (about 30). My game creator left and I entered hell. 
&#62; 
&#62;      I'm sorry...  Where did you find 30 infravision scrolls?  The 
&#62; things are kinda rare...  Assuming you did the old, restart a million 
&#62; times until you can buy what you want from the witch trick, that's 
&#62; kinda cheating too...
&#62; 
&#62; (snip)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; In level 16 it proved to be harder, for as on the one hand my stock 
&#62; &#62; of infravisions had been halfed, and I had forgotten to purchase a 
&#62; &#62; telekinesis book on the other. I went up to level 1 and 5 (got almost 
&#62; &#62; killed in 5, had to drink all potions, then escape) and searched for 
&#62; &#62; a staff of telekinesis or a book, but after about a quarter of an 
&#62; &#62; hour I reentered hell since I had no luck. So I had to make it the 
&#62; &#62; normal way. I now realized that if I was killed, I wouldn't stand a 
&#62; &#62; chance to get back my equipment. When I again made one false step, a 
&#62; &#62; blood knight got aware of me and started hitting, I needed to use 5-6 
&#62; &#62; potions (one after every hit), to kill him. Fortunately, I had more 
&#62; &#62; space for potions now, since I had used many of my infras.
&#62; 
&#62;      See now, this makes me a little suspicious, because if you had 
&#62; ever actually been to hell, you would have realized that you don't 
&#62; lose your equipment when you die on level 16...   Hmmmmmmm.
&#62; 
&#62;  
&#62; &#62; I proceeded and killed only if necessary, then opened the gate to 
&#62; &#62; diablo. I attracted the surrounding knights and ran away, then I went 
&#62; &#62; back to them and they didn't notice. It was fun. I killed about three 
&#62; &#62; Advocates blocking the way to diablo. Then I started swinging at him, 
&#62; &#62; and the poor guy neither knew what hit him nor inflicted even 1 hp of 
&#62; &#62; damage to me. After some time he died, and I had reached my goal.
&#62; 
&#62;      This doesn't explain how you could have gotten to the skull 
&#62; lever in the spiral room...  I sincerely doubt you could have snuck 
&#62; by all of those knights in that tiny corridor, and you certainly 
&#62; couldn't have killed all of them if you had trouble earlier with just 
&#62; one knight.
&#62; 
&#62;      Still, a pretty interesting idea...
&#62; 
&#62; </pre>
