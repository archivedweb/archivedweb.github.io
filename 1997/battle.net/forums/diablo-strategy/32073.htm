<pre>The pricing structure is kind of screwy at times and things that 
are worthless sometimes get high prices and things that are really 
good don't always cost as much as they ought to. For example, my 
rouge 
bought a godly great helm of the whale from Wirt and it wasn't that 
much considering what a find it is - I don't even think it was above 
100,000 gp. For the record I personally have never seen anything more 
expensive than you can buy (i.e. more than the gold you can carry - 
which is 200,000 gps.) Some of this discrepency seems to be due to 
misjudgements by the game designers - like blood star spells being on 
page 4 and costing 27.5k. I flipped through the official strategy 
book 
in the mall and it said there this spell was one of the most powerful 
since monsters weren't immune to magic. I decided there and then that 
the people who made the game weren't neccessarily the best at playing 
it. It could be that splint and gothic were thought to be more 
accessible to rouges and sorcs (splint has the best ac for them w/out 
boosts and maybe gothic was thought to be the highest most people 
would be able to boost to??) and therefore they are more valuable?? 
It could also just be a glitch.
