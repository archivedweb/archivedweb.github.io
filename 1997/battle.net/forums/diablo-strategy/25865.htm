1.  Yes, single player mode is limited, the higher difficulty levels 
should have been carried over to single player. 

2.  My solution to that is I play multiplayer by myself, which is 
more challenging than single player in more than one way.

3.  Yes there's LOTS of cheating and player killing on B.net, which I 
think is TRULY sad.  The couple of solutions I can think of is join a 
legit, cooperative guild and only get into passworded games, or find 
someone to play via modem with.

4.  As for B.net being unstable, I don't use it but all games have 
some element of instability and crashing nowadays.  I think Diablo is 
not as bad as some games in the past have been.

5.  And as for the user interface, I love it, it's simple and works 
for this game as far as my opinion goes. 

Don't be too discouraging, I think it's obvious that this is a 
seriously addictive game.  It's what I can't wait to get home from 
work for.

&#62; &#62; I agree with NateTheGreat, Diablo kicks all other game's ass and you

&#62; &#62; convinced all of my friends to buy it and I hope you will too...  
&#62; &#62; Work hard at those music lessons so you can get the game.  BTW, what 
&#62; &#62; do you take, piano, sax,....?

&#62; Ok, I bougth Diablo in January and... I still play it. IMHO, Diablo 
&#62; is as revolutionary as Doom was 4 years ago. Maybe more.
&#62; 
&#62; However! There are a lot of bad point which must be said.
&#62; 
&#62; - On single mode, Diablo sucks.
&#62; - Newbies are targeted by many peoples with differents intentions.
&#62; - The &#34;cheats&#34;! :(
&#62; - B'net is definitly not stable.
&#62; - The user interface is nice, but... very limited.
&#62; 
&#62; At least those are the point which ennoy me. I repeat I continue to 
&#62; play Diablo despite them, but they exist.
