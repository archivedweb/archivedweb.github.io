&#62; hi,
&#62; 
&#62; My rogue was recently PK'd for the first time *mumble mumble* I was 
&#62; using eaglehorn, you see.  This pk (he was a mage) started casting a 
&#62; firewall in between him and me. And although he persisted he wasn't 
&#62; using god mode (and this was true as later on a friend had his ear)
&#62; He wouldn't die. I was hitting him nearly everytime. He wasn't using 
&#62; mana shield either. Is this because eagle horns  damage sux??? I was 
&#62; using a amulet of radiance and a ring of the eagle. 

 There is a bug that sometimes prevents a player from seeing another 
player's mana-shield, I don't know if it was fixed in V1.4. Was his 
hp taking damage? A sorceror is usually a better dueler than a rogue, 
exit games from pks just to annoy them.
&#62; If that is the case. What bow would be the best. I have 45 str and 
&#62; can boost it up to 70 when using an amulet of the titans.  What would 
&#62; the best bow I should be looking for on the trading post?

 Eaglehornn is good(duh) some rogues prefer it to windforce. I  
thought most of the ppl in the trading post are cheaters? U might get 
a dupe, so pls be careful. 

&#62; Also, what do you do when you are playing as a mage and the creatur 
&#62; is immune to fire?? I have lvl 9 fireball but only level 4 lightning. 
&#62; and chain lightning eats up my mana (around 200) really quick. I'm 
&#62; currently using a lightning staff of fireball and using that it takes 
&#62; for ever to kill one. so by the time I've killed two my mana shield 
&#62; is down and it's all over. 

 Use lightning at lower levels or chain-lightning at higher levels, 
if the cost is too high visit Adria often for books. Bring lots of 
potions, sorcerors drink lots of them. 
&#62; Please anyone (particularly high level rogues and mages) help,
&#62; 
&#62; Mystery 
&#62; level 14 rogue.
&#62; 

 Help is here, just don't annoy me if u meet me on b.net.
 Ingrats are the worst, u are the first person I've help in this 
forum in weeks. :)
