Geez, just when you think you know someone :)



to a certain extent accepting items from a 
&#62; higher level character is not good, but its definitly not cheating. i 
&#62; give items to low level characters, but i dont give them ring of zod 
&#62; or windforce or whatever. i give them ring of precision ring of bow 
&#62; of giants... now i dont see that as anything wrong.

Well, to a certain extent, the thing that i see most wrong about this 
practice is that this means that players will have items they 
normally couldn't get access to at their level, which, in my opinion, 
ruins the game, because the player has much better items then they 
could get on their own, thereby making the game too easy for them.


 plus sometimes i 
&#62; make them work for it. i gave alvais a ring of zod, he is level 32. 
&#62; and i m making him helping out new comers to the clan to get this 
&#62; ring. now i think thats very acceptable.
&#62; 
in that case, it is acceptable, because alvais could very easily have 
found a zod ring by level 32, by 34 i was wearing a zod ring and 
amulet, and had traded another zod ring for a merciless bow of 
thunder and the zod ring i was wearing.



&#62; what happens if u r level 20 and u find a df, and this level 35 finds 
&#62; a wf, can u 2 trade in ur clan? since these 2 items r reasonably 
&#62; close in value.
&#62; 
I admit that the items are close in value, and that the trade would 
be fair regardless of the levels of the players, but in my guild, yes 
it would be illegal, the three level rule applies to all trades, 
except where the members are playing together and the item is found 
in that game, and in that case it still follows the 5 level co-op 
rule of my guild.



&#62; well other then this that needs to clarify i agree 100&#37; with 
&#62; every word u have in ur post.

&#62; 
&#62; p.s. the title got ur attention huh ;) 
yep, you got me with that one :)
