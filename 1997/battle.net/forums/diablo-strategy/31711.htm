&#62; Code Myster,
&#62; 
&#62; First of all, I can't believe the volume of replies here!  Wow, it 
&#62; sure was hard to refrain from reading them before responding.  But I 
&#62; did as you suggested, so here's my (unaffected) opinion.
&#62; 
&#62; I have responded to each one by cutting and pasting it here, and 
&#62; telling whether or not I think it's cheating, and then telling 
&#62; whether or not I do (or have done) it.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; accept Gold from another player?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     I have done it, but only with my high level character.
&#62;     At a certain point, there's no difficulty in finding a 
&#62;     lot of gold.  Then, it's just an inconvenience to have
&#62;     to go back to the dungeon when you are only 1000 or so 
&#62;     short of buying something.
&#62; 
&#62; accept Items from a higher char?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     I have only accepted items from a friend with whom I
&#62;     play modem games.  We are always within one level of 
&#62;     each other, however.  I have never (and won't) accept
&#62;     items from any character that is a lot higher.
&#62; 
&#62; have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Same as above.
&#62; 
&#62; have higher level chars give lower level chars elixers?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Similarly, only from that one friend.  Again, we are 
&#62;     always within one level of each other.  In this case,
&#62;     would both buy elixers as they came available, and we 
&#62;     would share them.
&#62; 
&#62; clear levels for lower players?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Have not.
&#62; 
&#62; Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, Adria or Griz for 
&#62; items?
&#62;   Not cheating. 
&#62;     Have, but only occasionally.  Never for hours on end.
&#62; 
&#62; use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
&#62;   Cheating.  
&#62;     Do it all the time.
&#62; 
&#62; allow lower players to portal into areas they could not regularly 
&#62; access?
&#62;   Not cheating.  
&#62;     Have.
&#62; 
&#62; create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra items?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Have in the past, but have found that there's really 
&#62;     no point in it.
&#62; 
&#62; transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Have in the past, but not with any of my current 
&#62;     characters.
&#62; 
&#62; Pk with the Nova spell?
&#62;   (A legit nova spell?)  Not cheating.
&#62;     Have never pk'ed.
&#62; 
&#62; Portal Kill someone?
&#62;   I'm not familiar with this one.  Anyone care to explain it?
&#62; 
&#62; Teleport in town?
&#62;   Cheating.
&#62;     Have done it in the past, but I no longer use the 
&#62;     trainer for anything.  (I have personally seen that 
&#62;     it can do some weird things.)
&#62; 
&#62; backup chars against system crashes?
&#62;   Not cheating.
&#62;     Do it all the time. 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Whew!  That was a lot of replying.  I hope you read it.  :-)
&#62; It's kind of interesting that the two things that I say are cheating, 
&#62; I have done.  Maybe I'm a cheater!  Oh, no!  j/k
&#62; 
&#62; In my opinion, almost none of the things you mentioned are cheating.  
&#62; BUT, that does not mean that they are legit.  (You guys MUST be 
&#62; getting tired of my middle-of-the-road attitude.)  :-)  You know my 
&#62; feelings.  If it feels right to you, you're having fun, and not 
&#62; hurting anyone else, go for it.

i had the exact reply that u did. well except the deye part, i guess 
i didnt think hard enough before putting an answer to that. i agree, 
it is a cheat but i use it. btw portal kill is when u set a portal 
and tell someone to come down and then kill that guy. i dont see how 
this can be cheating.

anyways, just to let u know, we do have something in common or at 
least we agree on something =) i read the reply and i decided not to 
say anything, i think its best to leave it the way it is. we just 
cant agree on the cheating vs legit topic. but as u said, we dont 
have to agree on everything. as i repect u and  i certainly do hope u 
ll respect me in return.
