Dizman,
I really don't think there is any way to tell if an identified item 
is an original or a dupe.  But, there are some &#34;common sense&#34; 
rules you
can follow (I'm sure you've probably figured these out, but this may
save some newbies from having to &#34;start over&#34; if they want 
100&#37; legit characters)

  A rule of Diablo that is also a rule of life:  if it looks too good
to be true (legit), it probably is.  Case in point:  someone offers 
to give you an obsidian ring of the zodiac.  It COULD theoretically 
be legit.  In that case, it's extremely unlikely they would have 
another comparable item; if that's true, why would they just GIVE it 
away??

  Related:  as you know, &#34;X of the ages&#34; means it's 
indestructable; some uniques are indestructable, and so is all 
jewelry.  If armor/weapons/staves/etc. do not have the suffix &#34;of 
the ages&#34; and the description says it's indestructable, it's a 
hack, and likely a dupe as well.

  Powerful items just lying arond (king's sword of blood???) are 
probably dupes--who in their right mind would &#34;forget&#34; to 
pick up a KSOB???

  To be save, I myself will ONLY take stuff that's either 
unidentified, or I saw drop on the floor, a trusted companion picked 
up and ID'ed, and offered to me ('cause I needed it more).

  Whimpy items are, I'd guess, probably not duped; why would anyone 
bother?

That's my take.  Some I KNOW are true (the indestructable one, for 
example); the otheres are mainly from reading these posts and just 
thinkin' about it.  If anyone knows a way to tell for sure if a given 
item is a hack/dupe, please, I'd like to know, too!!  (and, if any of 
this is dead wrong, let everyone know!!)
