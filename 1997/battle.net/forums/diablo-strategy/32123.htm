&#62; OK, St. Mike and Dizzy, I've decided to take your excellent advice.
&#62; Enought about cheating already!!!!  Let's talk about something else,
&#62; like how to play the dam game!!!  Let's talk tactics, and the best
&#62; (your favorite) mix of characters for a multi (3 or 4) group!
&#62; 
&#62;   OK, for a high level group (30+) I'm sold on 2/3 rogues and 1/2 
&#62; mages.  I played (29 l rogue) with DarkSniper (rogue-level 36, i 
&#62; think-not sure, sorry DS) and Aahz (l 45 mage) in nm hell.  Let me
&#62; tell you, the combination of MASS stoning and arrows is unbelievable.
&#62; I don't think a warrior would fit in well here, because arrows flew
&#62; in every direction, almost constantly.  Too much possibility of
&#62; friendly fire.  I think this tactic will probably work real well only 
&#62; if the mage is high enough to make mass stone cursing practical.
&#62;   Low to mid level (1-25 or so), I really like to get a SKILLED 
&#62; fighter in there.  It is definitely challenging, and helps develop 
&#62; tactics, communication, and patience!
&#62;   To elaborate, each group member must know, and act on, his/her role.
&#62; The fighter has to be able to charge in there, while not activating 
&#62; too many creatures, and protect the ranged attackers from the melee 
&#62; beasties.  The ranged attackers must provide cover fire if/when the 
&#62; warrior is overwhelmed, take out the distance baddies, and provide 
&#62; other magical support (I like healing my companions, myself . . .), 
&#62; all the while being patient enough to let the fighter take his 
&#62; position before screaming out the arrows/magic.  The same lesson in 
&#62; patience goes for the fighter; he must be able to draw fire away from 
&#62; the ranged guys ('cause, most likely, he's the one who can take the 
&#62; most hits) while not getting so close as to scare them away (dam 
&#62; goats!! hate 'em . . .)
&#62; 
&#62;   This poses a problem in hell.  When you have a room full of 
&#62; bwitches, the only way the fighter can be really effective is to have 
&#62; a free range of motion in order to chase down and corner them (while 
&#62; avoiding the bloodstars!); the mage/rogue needs a clear field in 
&#62; order to fire at will.  These are mutually exclusive needs; but, with 
&#62; clear communication before hand, and careful execution during, it can 
&#62; be accomplished (ex: warrior:I'll stay to the top half; you clear out 
&#62; the bottom   or something like that).
&#62; 
&#62; To sum up:  I like a 3 person group (right, Dizzy?? ;-} ) with one of
&#62; each class at levels below 30, and 3 or 4 person group with at least 
&#62; 2 rogues and at least 1 wizard (stone curse a must--thanx for the 
&#62; lesson Aahz!)
&#62; 
&#62; That's my take.  I'd like to hear others' opinions on group tactics; 
&#62; it seems a useful subject in a strategy forum. . . .maybe it's just 
&#62; me . . .
&#62; 
&#62; fight the good fight,
&#62; Boots

ok, here's my take on the issue, first of all, more then one mage in 
a team is overkill, especially with rogues along who have enough 
magic to be effective in that department. The mage is there to clear 
out the ranged attackers, and to cast stone and heal other to help 
the others out, and to play diversion when everyone dies so the 
others can get their stuff. :)
The point of the rogue in a multi co-op through hell is very similar 
to the mage, take out ranged attacks, provide cover fire for the 
warriors and mages, and throw a spell or two around to help the mage 
with his work load of throwing stones and heal others around. The 
rogue has a distinct advantage in taking out long range attacks in 
that nothing is immune to arrows, and arrows are alot less dangerous 
then 1000 pt fireballs and chain lightnings for the other players. 
And a rogue can get and throw those 1000 pt fireballs, just like the 
mage if they work at it, and rogue's chain lit's don't seem to be as 
effected as mages chainlit by gaps, so a rogues chain is more 
effective (assuming same level chain). I believe optimum performance 
includes 2 rogues, but 4 rogues in unison works well too. :)
The warrior, the poor underrated warrior. I am serious when I say 
underrated, the warrior can wade in and take on knights without 
flinching, and keep the demons off of their allies, so that the 
rogues and mages can get off the long distance attacks and take out 
the distance attackers. True, the warrior can easily get hit with 
friendly fire, but hey, he's a tank, he can take it. i recommend 1 or 
2 warriors in a group.
      So I guess I would say that the best touring party, in my 
opinion is either 1 mage 1 warrior 2 rogues, or 2 warriors and 2 
rogues, assuming the rogues have their magic potential worked up.
I further believe that the class that could best handle a group of 4 
of them playing together would be the rogue. Mages would get in each 
others way, and warriors would be spending their time chasing down 
long range attackers, and waking other monsters up, warriors are 
great to group with, but with no effective long range attack, 4 
warriors would be hurting for a bow or some speedy spells to come 
help them out.
      I guess this post is long enough, :)
