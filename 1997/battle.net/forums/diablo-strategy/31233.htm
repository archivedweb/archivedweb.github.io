<pre> You mean Fire_made_Flesh does not do much, next time type properly 
for important things.

 When FMF started his clan, he did most on his own(whats that Twig? 
Sorry I'm deaf in one ear). He did a lot for this clan, and he still 
does. It will be an unfair accusation to say he does not do much. 
Where did you get that idea from anyway?
 I have respect for Fire_made_Flesh(more than you hee hee), he has 
made mistakes many times, but then so has I. He got the guild running 
much by itself, if that isn't a sign of leadership I don't know what 
is. In fact, some of the members insisted on taking the 
responsibilities, they wanted to do something for the clan, they do 
not want to have a free ride, FMF needs help, they volunteered. Some 
of the clan members still want to take some things of FMF's hand, but 
FMF refused and now he's still kept busy maintaining the clan. He is 
like a boss, a manager, you have the wrong impression of him.
 Perhaps you should know that FMF is one of the most knowlegable (on 
Diablo) person I know of. For instance, do you know that you you can 
get all 3 dots just from killing  Diablo in hell diff, there is no 
need for normal and nightmare. I and he knew this months ago, and his 
knowledge of the game is one reason I joined his clan. There are a 
lot more tricks for this game of course, some I think only I know. :)
 
 Angels Of Hell, not a spiffy name, do you have screenings? I don't 
know much about your clan either. 
 Having another clan just spreads the legits out more, why create? 
Join! Hah! not to you Darksniper, u already got one. I should have 
responded to your post about &#34;What is a good clan to join?&#34;

 I'm getting bored of Diablo, UO UO wherest thou?
 PS: have you been to Diablo Information</pre>
