Hi Eric_A_Warrior,

Well, Valor (Level 5) some people have trouble finding the 3 
bloodstones to put on the pedestal.  the first one is right there and 
when you put it on it opens a room nearby that was not there before.  
More Horned Demons to fight, place the 2nd stone on the pedestal and 
another room you could not get into opens nearby, more horned demons, 
place the last stone, another room opens up, MORE horned demons then 
you get some pretty good armor.  Just try not to let those horned 
demons ram you, keep moving around.

The other quest sounds like chamber of bone.  There are stairs to a 
mini-level (on 6th floor) where you I think fight more Horned demons 
and Unseen monsters.  If you have not seen (hehehe) these monsters 
yet, you usually won't until they are right next to you attacking 
you.  Just don't let yourself get surrounded by them, they are not 
hard to kill in smaller numbers.  There are I think 2 levers to pull 
and then you get into a room with TONS of skeletons and I think 
Unseens.  A good tactic here is do not jump right in the room, stand 
just outside the doorway and take them on a couple at a time.  (or as 
a mage, I prefer casting a firewall or two just inside the door - 
that's fun!)
The end result of this quest is some magic items in a couple of 
secret rooms opened by the levers and when you read the book at the 
end of the room, you get the guardian spell.

Hope I helped, have fun.

&#62; &#62; I think you are speaking of the Magic Rock Quest?  If this is the 
&#62; &#62; quest in question, initiated by Griswold (a caravan passed through 
&#62; &#62; town, etc.), the rock is somewhere on Level 5 of the dungeon, on a 
&#62; &#62; pedestal.  When you return it to Griswold he will give you something.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Just as a note, Single Player mode games randomly generate the quests 
&#62; &#62; you receive.  Every time you start a new Single player game you could 
&#62; &#62; get a quest you did not get before.  So this is not necessarily the 
&#62; &#62; &#34;3rd quest&#34;, just the third one you received.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Have fun and good luck!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Ineed help!
&#62; &#62; &#62; If any1 knows where the holystone in the single player game is
&#62; &#62; &#62; please tell me.
&#62; &#62; &#62; I think the holy stone is the 3rd quest.
&#62; &#62; &#62; Thanx!
&#62; Thanx for thge info, but i figured it out. I am now a 11 lvl warior
&#62; ( single-player ) and my character is completly legit. I am so
&#62; proud of myself! I am now doing the quests of VALOR and some other
&#62; one called BONECRUNCHER or something.
&#62; If u have any hints, info, or strategys ( or just something to say )
&#62; please do!</pre>
