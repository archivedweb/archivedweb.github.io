<pre>Alrighty, I was just curious as to ALL the people who think that most 
uniques are USELESS.  NOW, don't get me wrong, there are a few that 
are undoubtedly the best weapons/armor..i.e.. Dreamflange is the best 
mage weapon, windforce/eaglehorn are two OF (not the two best) the 
best bows.  Now, being an experienced (don't even test me) Laz 
Runner, I have found ALMOST every unique in the game.  Noticeably, 
off hand, the biggest I have yet to find is Eaglehorn.

Q.  What uniques do you think are the best for each character and are 
there (In your opinion) any &#34;non uniques&#34; better than those 
uniques?

Ok, I guess this is the direction I would like this post to go in:

1.  State (what you believe) is the best item for THE CHARACTER THAT 
YOU ARE MOST EXPERIENCED IN for every weapon slot (read my answer for 
guidance) (i.e..dreamflange/mage, blah blah..etc. etc.)


My answers:

1.  Mage/Weapon:  I am a believer in the powers of a dreamflange.  
The greatest weapon(IMHO) for a mage...forget the PlentifulAAA staff 
(handy in tough situations though), dreamflange rules!  (BTW, what is 
the highest charged Apoc staff you've found?  Mine is 26 ad it was 
plentiful NOT bountiful err..one of em..now I forgot..grrr!)

    Mage/Armor:  Ac is unimportant to me, as it has had little effect 
in my mage's game so far.  I prefer Naj's &#34;Light&#34; Plate 
because of the spell increase (looking for another, because my other 
one broke...only found 2 of these little beauties so far).  If I 
couldn't have Naj's, I would want an Obsidean (mail, plate..doesn't 
matter) of Wizardry (of course I got rid of mine when I found 
Naj's..grrr..again)

   Mage/Shield (if nec.):  For a shield, I am looking for something 
to increase my &#34;needed&#34; stats, like resistance, because I 
have no need for AC, Stormshield is of little use.  I have and prefer 
an Emerald (or Obsidean, just happened to get one notch better) 
Shield of (anything)

   Mage/Helm:  I have thinking cap, which I think will be good once I 
have the patience to goto a &#34;hidden&#34; shrine and &#34;up&#34; 
the durabilty.  Otherwise, I have and would prefer Royal Circlet 
because (not only) does it have 40ac (of little importance) but it 
adds 60 mana (I think..uhh..15mag and 30 mana?).

   Mage/rings/amulets:  Ahh, the mighty rings and amulets.  These 
little (but powerful) item may look like normal items, but can boost 
your Mag or str etc. (amazingly!) up by quite alot (:)).  I prefer 
Obs. Am of Wizardry, A Ring of the Zodiac, and an Obsidean ring.  If 
you don't need more resistance adders as rings/or amulets, I would 
prefer (anything) of Widardry.

Blah!

Anyways, bordom unleashes my imagination, hope to here from you 
&#34;skilled&#34; characters, Blah!
