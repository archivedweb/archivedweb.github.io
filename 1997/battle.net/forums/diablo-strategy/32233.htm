<pre>&#60;...this horse is so dead, it looks like it died in the middle
of a crowd of a hundred Ultima Online beta testers
all desperate for meat...&#62;

This is a response to Zamp's post below:

<a href="http://www.battle.net/forums/diablo-strategy/32093.htm">http://www.battle.net/forums/diablo-strategy/32093.htm</a>

*WARNING, WARNING: Read on at your own risk*

Especially since it looks like I have to eat a little humble
pie here. After quite a bit of thought, I have to agree with
Zamp's statement that there is:

&#34;no difference between copying the specific data files by 
 DOS or by Kevin's program and copying these files as part
of a larger group (up to and including the entire hard disk)&#34;

Now, I have to say that I still _feel_ there is a difference between
backing up my Diablo files while doing my weekly tape back up
(Ok -- I admit it -- my annual tape back up), and backing them up
using DiabloBackup.exe --- but it's not sustainable by any
rational argument I can see.

That being so, as Zamp and a number of others pointed out,
it is inconsistent to maintain that using DiabloBackup.exe to
backup/restore corrupted Diablo files is &#34;cheating&#34; but using
a full system backup to do the same thing, among others,
 is not.  And while I appreciated Lok's agreement on &#34;backup as
cheating&#34; and admire his consistency in not restoring
characters after a hard drive crash, in no way shape or form
could that be called &#34;cheating&#34;.

What does this do for the whole question of what is and isn't
&#34;cheating&#34; --- well once you say some external programs are
not &#34;cheats&#34; I don't see any way to  draw a line, other than
how you want to play the game, and it becomes pretty meaningless
(cheers from the side!).  Is Deye cheating? It's a third party 
program,
does stuff  Bliz's Diablo program doesn't do, is that 
&#34;cheating&#34;? hmm...I dunno. It's not &#34;cheating&#34; to 
restore my character
after a crash --- what if I just lost my MBOH to lag (I wish!)? Bliz 
didn't
intend me to loose stuff to lag, and it hardly affects the game
play at all,  so it wouldn't be &#34;cheating&#34; to restore.
I just got MK'ed -- Bliz didn't mean that to happen either...

Finally, I agree with Lok on another thing: the main reason not to 
backup
is nothing to do whether it's &#34;legit&#34; or not --- the game's 
just a heck of a lot
more exciting when you have no safety net (even if you never fall 
off).
