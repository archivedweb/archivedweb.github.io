<pre>&#60;SNIP&#62;
&#62; Summary: Blizzards Diablo has broken new ground. It has brought up 
&#62; new questions that are VERY hard to answer. Game Ethics are now at 
&#62; the heart of alot of most game discussions and game designs now.
&#62; 
&#62; Games such as UO are going to be constantly monitored to force 
&#62; players to play the game as intended allowing less &#34;freedom&#34; 
&#62; to the individual players.
&#62; 
&#62; As for the current state of Diablo, Cheating has made everyone 
&#62; &#34;equal&#34;. There is no need to kill others unless you are 
&#62; either PK or PK hunter. 
&#62; 
&#62; Now, people stay out of public games for 2 reasons. #1 is that they 
&#62; wish to avoid PK's. #2 is that they wish to avoid &#34;cheaters&#34;. 
&#62; Had Diablo existed &#34;cheat free&#34;, everyone would still be 
&#62; avoiding public games because of a more serious threat, the threat of 
&#62; getting MK'ed and losing everything they own.
&#62; 
&#62; Which Diablo would be better? I do not know... if I had to answer, I 
&#62; would take Diablo in it's current state than this senario I have 
&#62; presented. I have played with alot of cheaters, most have been very 
&#62; fun to play with. I have also played with PK's.... not a single one 
&#62; of them has been at all &#34;fun&#34;. 
&#62; 
&#62; You will have to answer this question for yourself.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;             -=/ Code Myster /=-

&#34;Cheaters&#34; tend to be boring to play with, and are often 
bored themselves.  
While this obviously has its exceptions, it is usually true.  It just 
comes with 
the territory of having everything too easy.  While sometimes 
annoying 
when they use their boosted items/powers to kill all the monsters or 
otherwise take the challenge of the game away, they are relatively 
harmless, and an unwanted encounter with one is easily remedied by
gracefully backing out of the game, if asking them to stop doesn't 
work.

Cheaters have managed to spoil open trading on bnet, but that is 
mostly a
technical problem.  It could be solved in the future with the 
generation
of unique ID's (as used in Windows 95/NT object registry) and server
registration of ownership.

PKillers, thieves, spammers, foul-mouths, and loosers who whisper
annoying or offensive messages to everyone with a feminine name can
all be lumped together as juvenile jerks who take advantage of the
faceless anonymity of the internet to engage in social behavior which
would be unacceptable anywhere outside of a correctional 
institution.  They are twisted perverts who get their jollies preying 
on 
innocent people, yet they are too cowardly to do it in person, 
prefering
the safety of hiding behind their computer.  Anyone behaving like they
do in public would be a social outcast, if not imprisoned or
institutionalized.  

You constantly hear them say &#34;it's only a game&#34; or &#34;its 
just for fun&#34;, as if
that somehow excuses rudeness.  Most parents punish their children if 
they play with others like these jerks do.  Yet the fact that there 
is no
way to &#34;enforce&#34; polite social behavior, and no chance of 
retaliation or
negative consequences for their actions, emboldens them to continue
their anti-social behavior.  

I shudder to think what may happen in the future when the thrill of 
this 
&#34;harmless&#34; preying on the innocent wears off.  What's next 
when 
nobody is around to abuse on bnet, or the thrill gets too weak to 
stimulate anymore?  What is the next level of attack, another game?  
Eventually all the games will pale.  Then what, go for real money?  
How about real people?  Its a long road from killing some 9 year old 
trying out battlenet for the first time to assaulting a real human, 
but 
the willingness to do the one (and the pleasure derived from it) 
indicates 
that the only thing preventing the other may be the cowardliness of 
the 
perpetrator.

Sorry about the preaching, but this b.s. I keep hearing about its ok
because its a game is just that, B.S.  If I agree to a competitive, 
everyone for himself game, its OK.  But if I want to play a nice,
friendly, _cooperative_ game, why can't I do it without worrying
about some pimple-faced nerd intentionally trying to ruin it for me?
After all, it IS a GAME.  Why can't we play &#34;nice&#34; together?

I guess that all goes to show that I, too, prefer playing in an 
environment filled with cheaters, to one filled with ruthless
player killers.  If I wanted that, I would go back to doom or quake 
where the whole object is to kill each other.

Now I have a question to pose on top of yours:

Does anyone think battlenet would/could have lasted even a 
month without private games?  

These are the only way to play together with people outside of 
your house, while still exercising control over who you play with.  
Without this ability, I think battlenet, and quite possibly Diablo, 
would have been a radically different &#34;community&#34;.  I wonder
just what kind of &#34;community&#34; Ultima Online will produce, 
without
that ability to ever let your guard down and just enjoy the game
with friends, without worrying about some stranger coming in to
hose your game for the &#34;fun&#34; of it.</pre>
