<pre> Maybe I'm just seeing the glass as half empty here, but I think this 
whole Godly does not exist speil everyone has been spouting here is a 
bunch of crap.  
 First of all, whoever said that Godly plate (with no other info-just 
Godly plate of any sort) does not exist for real is either severly 
lacking in playing time to make such a statement or a liar.  I have 
been offered Godly Breast plate from Wirt on a couple of occasions, 
and once it was of the Whale (I was thinking of buying it just as a 
trophy, but didn't have the cash-it was like 110-120k).  
 As for it only existing in Single player, I find that ridiculous.  
If anything, it should be offered only in MULTI player.  Anyone who's 
played single player knows that if you had godly plate, even Field 
plate, you'd be almost invincible to anything in single.  Since it 
does exist there though (so I've heard...not that lucky when I played 
through), it is obviously going to be easier to get (I found awesome 
gothic on an armor stand at level 22 with my s.p. sorcerer), so it 
makes sense that it's been seen there, but that doesn't mean that it 
doesn't exist in multi as well.
 A friend of mine whom I play with on modem occasionally, and who 
actually introduced me to Diablo when he showed me the pre-release 
demo back in November, and who accquired the game around the same 
time I did (early January), told me that he FOUND Godly full plate in 
a barrel in hell.  I know what you're thinking, in a barrel?!?!? Yeah 
right!  
 This individual is a very reliable source, and this incident 
supposedly occured at a time before it was possible for some ghost to 
drop the item from thin air.  I personally am slightly skeptical, but 
do tend to believe that this did happen.
 Holy items are another controversy here, it seems.  In my Diablo 
career, and it's been a long one, I have seen about 20 items with the 
holy prefix, and most of them have been crapola.  Two days ago 
(Tuesday) one of my wizards was able to buy a Holy Gothic Shield of 
the Ages, AC 18, +167&#37; from Wirt for about 60k (he also got 
offered Awesome Full Plate from gris-AC 74 +143&#37; His AC is now 
290!).  I also bought a friend a Holy Crown I saw a while back.  
Anyway, it seems to me that Holy items are actually more rare than 
Godly ones, but this may just be a fluke.
