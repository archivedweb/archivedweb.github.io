<pre>I've played a few warriors to high levels and the one sure time that 
I always use a bow is when I find acid hounds with a unique.  Trying 
to kill fifteen of these guys with a sword is ridiculus, but with a 
bow, you can hit them, but they can't hit you.  This is only until 
the warrior gets to about level 25.  After that, he can just walk in 
and kill them and perhaps use about two full heal potions.

Also, lightning against gargoyles and knights (Chain L. if you got it)
Fireball against witches if you got it, otherwise, about two well 
placed firewalls.

However, using anything but a sword for most other monsters is just 
too slow.  For example, if you're in caves and a bunch of monsters 
are behind the lava stream, find an opening and fight with your 
sword.  The opening should only allow one monster to cross at a time, 
and occasionally, if the monsters are lined up, use a lightning.  Of 
course, this is only for non-ranged monsters.

&#62;  I am a level 24 (legit - of course) warrior and I have had the best
