&#62; OK -- in many ways the discussion of what is and is not
&#62; &#34;cheating&#34; can get pretty silly, and you easily wind up
&#62; dissussing ridiculous niggling details which are of no
&#62; interest to anyone. All those not interested need read no
&#62; further...
&#62; 
&#62; But you cannot play Diablo
&#62; for 6 months without contemplating what does and does not
&#62; constitute &#34;cheating&#34; and what does and does not constitute
&#62; &#34;unethical&#34; or &#34;unacceptable&#34; play (they are not the 
&#62; same thing:
&#62; nowhere have I said that people who backup are unethical).
&#62; The sheer volume of replies to Code's post indicates that
&#62; many other people have thought a lot about this too.
&#62; 
&#62; As should be clear from my post above, I believe that if you
&#62; want to draw a line between what is &#34;legit&#34; and what is
&#62; &#34;cheating&#34; then you have to say that use of a third party
&#62; _Diablo_ progam is &#34;cheating&#34;.  Many may be &#34;acceptable
&#62; cheats&#34; but then you're on very subjective ground as to
&#62; which programs are ok and which aren't ok. People can and
&#62; do have many opinions about that.
&#62;  
&#62; Please note that I said &#34;Diablo backup program&#34;. You will have
&#62; to look elsewhere for a lunatic who says that making a full
&#62; backup of your hard drive is a Diablo &#34;cheat&#34; (I do back up
&#62; my hard drive, btw). Now, I think you're saying that there's
&#62; no difference between using a Diabo backup program and doing
&#62; a standard system backup, so neither involves &#34;cheating&#34;.
&#62; All I can say is I feel that there is a difference. Anyone
&#62; still reading this can take a look at Kevin Lambert's site
&#62; (which has the best backup utility) and decide what they think:
&#62; 
&#62; <a href="http://www.users.lith.com/~kevin/diablo/index.html">http://www.users.lith.com/~kevin/diablo/index.html</a>
&#62; 
&#62; I think the question of whether or not it is &#34;cheating&#34; to
&#62; backup your Diablo character hits a nerve because it's
&#62; actually very significant  (not because it's too trivial to discuss)
&#62;  -- it does make a big difference if your carefully nurtured
&#62; lvl 39 character is tucked safely away somewhere.

So what difference does it make if your character is backed up by a 
_Diablo_ 3rd party program or a standard system backup?  The result 
is still the same....you have a backed up file of your character. You 
say you feel there is a difference, please explain what that 
difference is.</pre>
