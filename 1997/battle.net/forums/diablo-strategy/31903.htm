<pre>Again, sorry it has taken so long to get this reply posted. I send 
Zamp private Email this morning telling him I wanted to really think 
out a reply to his great post. Also, I wanted to again thank those 
who have been in this VERY intelligent discussion. It has been a real 
&#34;thinker&#34; for me.

Ok, think where alot of our problems come from is a question between 
Ethics and Cheating. Cheating can (with few exceptions I can't think 
of right now but must exist) be defined as: use of ANY 3rd party 
program not supplied by Blizzard. Ethics though is harder to define 
as we have all grown up with different beliefs.

I do think, that most of us would agree that something can become so 
&#34;unethical&#34; that it BECOMES cheating. The DUP bug jumps right 
out at me here. With that said, let me answer what I can of Zamps 
post (you bring up some hard points my friend.... hard indeed).

&#62; Since I have additional comments and questions for you both, based on 
&#62; the cheating survey results, I decided to start a new thread. (BTW, 
&#62; CM, did you notice that your survey was re-posted in Ogden's with 
&#62; several replies? You may want to update your results.)
&#62; 
&#62; CM, I admire the fact that you were willing to change your answer to
&#62; #10, both because of the fact that you are willing to change your mind
&#62; and because you are being consistent with your prior analysis.  

Thank you. It was my error to have originally defined it that way 
(unfortunatly, it's now 1 more way I can be concidered a 
&#34;cheater&#34; :)

 
&#62; I agree with you, Lok, the fundamental question is how you define 
&#62; cheating.  You and I seem to have the same definition.  Compare the 
&#62; definition in your discussion:
&#62; 
&#62;    It appears that everyone has their own view on cheating. Many 
&#62;    people do not have a consistant view on cheating. Anyone can 
&#62;    create a whole big long laundry list of 'easy' tactics which 
&#62;    some might frown upon and call cheating. By defining cheating 
&#62;    in this subjective manner, you are heading for an inconsistant 
&#62;    view on cheating.
&#62; 
&#62;    The only objective view of cheating is that any 3rd party 
&#62;    program is cheating. Abuse of bugs is a gray area, but in 
&#62;    general I would lump abuse of bugs in with cheating since bugs 
&#62;    were not intended to be in the game. Anything else is legit play.
&#62; 
&#62; with my definition of cheating given in my reply to CM (and earlier 
&#62; posts) (although I do not think the use of internal anomalies or bugs 
&#62; not intended to be in the game is a gray area; I consider it to be
&#62; cheating).  And I think, CM, that this is probably fairly close to 
&#62; your definition as well.

Yes. As a Game Programmer, I see things others don not.... such as AI 
patterns, &#34;trigger points&#34; etc which makes it hard to avoid 
taking advantage of. In War2, I really saw some AI loopholes early on 
and it has been hard to not exploit them.

 
&#62; I do not include the phrase &#34;to gain an (unfair) advantage&#34; 
&#62; in my
&#62; definition of cheating because this incorporates intent in the 
&#62; definition, which I prefer not to do.  First, I want to keep the 
&#62; definition as objective as possible, and leave the subjective value
&#62; judgments for later (e.g., is the cheating harmful, justified, etc.?).
&#62; Second, incorporating intent/advantage into the definition seems to 
&#62; encourage inconsistency.  I believe that the identical pattern
&#62; of behavior should be considered a cheat regardless of what the 
&#62; intent was.  Third, is raises the question of what can be considered 
&#62; an 
&#62; advantage?  Is is an unfair advantage to duel when one person has a 
&#62; much faster computer or connection than another?  Perhaps, but it is
&#62; not cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, let's get to specific cases:
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Shopping&#34;  -  CM, your points are well taken in that 
&#62; &#34;shopping&#34; may reduce the challenge of the game, but I think 
&#62; that this incorporates 
&#62; the &#34;intent/advantage&#34; element that I leave out of my 
&#62; definition. There are many things that give someone an advantage, 
&#62; fair or unfair,
&#62; but as long as it is part of the game design and does not take 
&#62; advantage of a bug, it should not be considered cheating.  I believe
&#62; Lok discussed the difference between actions that are cheats and 
&#62; actions that reduce the challenge of the game (e.g., accepting items
&#62; from a higher level character) in a previous post.

Hmmmm I typed up a whole huge paragraph here explaining my 
position.... but the argument seemed to fall apart at the end so I 
nuked it. Shopping is not prohibited nor regulated in the game. It's 
not really a bug either. I think this is a case where I feel: 
&#34;it's unethical to the point of cheating&#34; because you are not 
really &#34;playing&#34;, which takes me to your next statement.

 
&#62; I noticed that you brought up the idea of playing the game.  To me,
&#62; someone creates or plays the &#34;game&#34; when they create the game 
&#62; and 
&#62; appear in town.  To me, wandering through town and selling or buying
&#62; items is &#34;playing&#34; the game.  Defining it otherwise leads to 
&#62; tough
&#62; questions about when playing the game actually begins.  For example, 
&#62; CM, do you consider it cheating for someone to portal up and down 
&#62; repeatedly from the dungeon to cause Adria to get a new supply of
&#62; elixirs, books and staves?  Does it matter if that person does nothing
&#62; on the dungeon side except cast a new town portal and reenter it, or
&#62; do they have to kill something?  (BTW, some people seem to define the 
&#62; &#34;game&#34; more broadly than either of us to include the entirety 
&#62; of b.net and sometimes even this forum. This came up in the PK 
&#62; debates a few weeks ago.)

This becomes a huge problem I really do not want to define.... or 
even know if it can be defined. Again I feel this is similar to 
continually restarting Solitaire games until you &#34;like&#34; the 
starting configuration. I feel the challenge in a game is to start 
it, and play it as it's presented. As for what is &#34;gameplay&#34;, 
Diablo is loosely defined as an RPG, sure you need to repair weapons, 
get new ones, etc, but the core of the game is fighting creatures. If 
you are only &#34;shopping&#34;, you are not truely &#34;playing&#34; 
(&#34;intent&#34; can be a clarifier here). It comes down to 
&#34;my&#34; opinion again and sometimes it's hard to explain. I can 
easily see why someone can justify shopping as game play though.


&#62; 
&#62; I also noticed that you distinguished between the Laz runs and 
&#62; shopping by the fact that Blizzard created a shortcut to get to Hell. 
&#62; First, this doesn't answer my question with regard to continuing on to
&#62; Level 16, since the same shortcut that leads to Laz leads to Level 
&#62; 16. The difficulty in deciding where cheating begins and ends in this 
&#62; question is why I define cheating the way I do.  Second, isn't this 
&#62; somewhat inconsistent with our analysis of a lower level character 
&#62; porting to Hell?  Arguably, Blizzard didn't want that
&#62; character to use the Hell shortcut until he/she reached Level 13 
&#62; through the preceding 12 levels.  And third, Blizzard gave us the 
&#62; ability to start a new game at any time.  If it had wanted us to 
&#62; &#34;play&#34; the game before restarting, they simply could have 
&#62; removed that option until a dungeon had been entered, etc. (i.e., 
&#62; whenever the &#34;game&#34; had been &#34;played&#34; sufficiently).

Good point. I can only say to this that while making a laz run to 
gain items, you have to fight and kill creatures. In shopping, there 
is no challenge, only patience. I guess thats why I hate 
&#34;shopping&#34;, no challenge, no risk. Blizzard could have added 
a &#34;re-randomize&#34; button for shoppers to just stand there and 
hit instead of haveing to hit the other &#34;re-randomize&#34; button 
called &#34;Restart&#34; *kidding*!

As for portaling low level people down, it is interesting that lower 
level chars are &#34;banned&#34; from entering the harder areas of 
the game, when in fact, they can join a Hell mode game via a modem 
without problems. Example: a Level 4 player cannot enter Normal Hell 
via the shortcut however, he can call his level 31 friend who has a 
Hell mode game going and join. I dare say Hell church is worse than 
Normal Hell. Ironic eh?

 
&#62; Lok, I like your analysis of balancing the &#34;shopping&#34; aspect 
&#62; with the difficulty of the &#34;walks&#34; to Wirt and Adria.  While 
&#62; I still feel it would not be cheating even if all the &#34;shops&#34; 
&#62; were close together, this indicates to me that Blizzard took 
&#62; &#34;shopping&#34; into consideration as something people would do 
&#62; within the game.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Elixirs&#34;  - CM, you noted that you were leaning towards 
&#62; calling this a cheat because Blizzard had indicated that they did not 
&#62; want lower level characters to use them by limiting their ability to 
&#62; purchase them.  But isn't this also inconsistent with our analysis of 
&#62; a lower level character to Hell?  As discussed above, Blizzard seems 
&#62; to have indicated that lower level characters should not have a 
&#62; shortcut to Hell unless they went through the preceding levels.  
&#62; Blizzard could have stopped lower level characters from using the 
&#62; portal method to enter Hell, and similarly could have made elixirs 
&#62; ineffective for characters below Level 26.  

Yes, but as I pointed out above, the whole &#34;lower char&#34; issue 
is ironic anyway. I don't know quite how to interpert it.
 
&#62; This also appears inconsistent with our analysis of &#34;middle-
&#62; man&#34; buying.  Blizzard seems to have indicated that lower level 
&#62; characters should not have the option of buying high level items by 
&#62; limiting their direct buying options.  But we agree that &#34;middle-
&#62; man&#34; buying is not a cheat.

*sigh* Yes it is inconsistent. One possible explaination (this 
comming from a game programmer again), being rushed for time, 
sometimes features in a game get over looked or even removed. The 
fact that there are hidden &#34;quests&#34; on the Diablo CD tells me 
that this was the case for at least a few Diablo features. I'm not 
trying to avoid the issue here, just add another insight. Maybe added 
restrictions were planned yet due to lack of time, yet skipped or 
forgotten (or again, they may have just had a few &#34;loop 
holes&#34; in their original design, which I think is more likely).
 
&#62; &#34;MKing&#34; - Since we're discussing Blizzard's intentions, I 
&#62; have a new question to toss in the mix.  Blizzard appears to have 
&#62; desired to limit the &#34;rewards&#34; of PKing to some gold and an 
&#62; ear.  In beta, the victim also lost their equipped items, but this 
&#62; feature was removed for the commercial release.  MKing, of course, is 
&#62; the use of monsters and spells to cause the victim to lose their 
&#62; equipped items, and appears to be contrary to Blizzard's intent to 
&#62; limit the rewards of PKing.  Is this a game anomaly/bug that should 
&#62; be considered cheating?

This is a very grey area now. First off, let me say I am very much 
anti-PK (but I acknowledge they have as much right to play as I do). 
As you stated, above, blizzard has made the attempt to curb this type 
of play. I personally feel it is not cheating as it is a stragetic 
way to play. I do feel it is HIGHLY unethical.... 1 step below portal 
killing someone. (Side note: Pk'ing someone, THEN gathering creatures 
and rezing the poor fella is ok to me as the player can Restart in 
Town. &#34;Helping&#34; someone die in the midst of creatures like 
what happened to DarkSniper when we played (was an accident while 
being COMPLETELY over run by Hell Spawn and Doom Guards) is a little 
more unethical because there really is nothing the guy can do.

Overall, I feel it is more strategy than true &#34;bug&#34;. (if you 
missed it, I posted a while back an theoretical post called 
&#34;Diablo, Alternative Reality&#34; that talks a little about this).

&#62; Looking forward to your thoughts. . . 
&#62; 
&#62; Zamp 
&#62; Snakegod
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  CM, you have now twice mentioned a new bug that allows the use 
&#62; of certain spells in town.  What spells can be cast?  Does it require 
&#62; the use of any external programs?  What should I watch out for? Can 
&#62; it lead to a new era of TownKill?  (If, like me, you would hate to 
&#62; see a new cheat of this sort get widely known and/or abused, please 
&#62; feel free to email me at the above address.)


I will not divulge this bug to anyone (which is VERY ironic because I 
run a Diablo Cheat page....) because it's really no more than an 
novelty. I have not tested all spells yet except for teleport and and 
Item Repair. It did not generate a &#34;XXXplayerXXX has cast an 
illegal spell&#34; that I know of (I was at witch when the guy who 
showed it to me was firing FireBolts in town showing someone else 
it). As far as I know, there are less than 12 people who know about 
it and they are keeping a secret. No, the spells do not hurt others 
so there is no danger. Like I said, it's a novelty at best. (it's 
damn hard to do though.... much like duping but the timing is 
incredibly hard to get down). I only did it a few times to see if it 
would work... haven't done it since.

Anyway I hope this post answers your questions. You pose some hard 
cases that are hard to answer. I do not know if there is an all 
encompassing &#34;answer&#34; that we can define. I think Diablo is 
an excellent game with a few logic loopholes designed into it that 
ask questions that cannot be accurately answered.
