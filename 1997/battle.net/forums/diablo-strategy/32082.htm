SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

I know there are those who will not want to read this post or even 
hear about what I'm about to post. For those in this group, do not 
scroll down. Leave now. 

I am about to discuss the most amazing strategy I have seen yet in 
Diablo. It makes the game so *EASY* that it is possible for a newbie 
to enter Hell Hell and beat EVERYTHING without armor or even advanced 
weapons.

This is unethical to the point of cheating... but it's legal, uses no 
cheats, no hacked items ... nothing but a simple strategy. It has 
forever changed my view of Diablo knowing how easy it is to kill 
EVERYTHING ... it's facinating yet depressing.

Ok, so you want to know what it is eh? I have seen at least 2 other 
posts on this concept in this forum over the past month or two. I'm 
not claiming I came with it either, but I did run enough experiments 
last night to add insight into the base idea.

All this came about because I tried to beat Diablo last night in Hell 
Hell with my Rogue. Nothing out of the norm about that, however I 
wanted to do it NAKED!!! That's right, NO ARMOR!!!! No Plate, Mail, 
Leather or anything. A naked Sorcerer can do quite well but how would 
a naked Rogue fair? I was SHOCKED by the outcome.

The basic premis I used was this: Creatures get &#34;activated&#34; 
by the &#34;light&#34; casted out by your player. The larger the 
light radius casted by your player, the more creatures you can 
activate as you move. By using Rings of Darkness, I wanted to make my 
light radius as small as possible and hence allowing me to get closer 
to creatures without activating them.  

With two rings of Darkness in my inventory, I dumped all my armor and 
spare items in town, loaded up on mana and headed to hell. When I got 
down, I put on the rings and WOW did it get *DARK*! It was really 
errie. I used one of a million Infra scrolls I had and started off 
slowly. The level contained Doom Guards and Lava Maw's. I had 
intended on getting close to a creature, stoning them and shooting 
them with my bow.

What happened you asked? I got my A** Kicked!!!! I was overcome in a 
blink of an eye and found myself back in town. I started back down, 
moved slowly and used 8 belt potions in Chain Lighting effectivly 
killing everything. I got both Darkness Rings and continued even more 
slowly. As creatures poured out at me, I chained them. It was a Mana 
intensive level but I got through it without dying again. It was 
weird though... the creatures seemed to be activated beyond my 
&#34;light radius&#34; (I found out why later).

After trip to town to repair Windy and get mana, I continued down to 
level 14. I again moved extremely slowly not wanting a repeat of 
level 13. It was wierd, I could walk up EXTREMELY close to creatures 
now! I stoned the Hell Spawn and shot them easy as pie. There were 
Guards there not immune to fire... it was AMAZING, as they were not 
moving, 1 fireball would kill 3 at a time! Not only that, it did not 
&#34;wake up&#34; the creatures standing next to the ones who died! 
It was SO easy! I did not die once on this level. I had to return to 
town to repair Windy again as well as get more mana.

As nothing moved when I got close, I was able to &#34;practice&#34; 
my Stone Curse and Arrow aiming. I have heard TONZ of people give 
their ideas on where to &#34;aim&#34; to increase your chances of 
hitting a creature... you know what?? They are all WRONG! I can now 
stone ANY single char out of a huge group each and every time. It was 
staggering to me to know in all this time, I had been aiming 
incorrectly. 

I learned something else staggering to me, as I used Windforce, a bow 
with Knockback, sometimes stray arrows would activate hellspawn off 
of the screen. Their AI tells them to come directly to me, regardless 
if they can see me or not. They would approach until they reached my 
&#34;light radius&#34; and would crouch down to fire. 1 shot from 
them would &#34;confuse&#34; them and they would wander back and 
forth across the light radius threshold. I found I could activate 
lots of hell spawn and only shoot them when they crouched down to 
fire. Hit them once and it would take them 4-5 sec to crouch back 
down, and give me time to kill others. It was easy! Also, I noticed 
that if I teleported only a few &#34;squares&#34; away, enough that 
my light radius did not hit them, they would instantly &#34;loose 
me&#34; even though I was still near them. I never had to retreat 
far, only a few squares!

I continued to level 15, even more confident now of my new found 
&#34;skills&#34;
Level 15 was a CAKEWALK with 1 exception. I was standing in a room 
that bordered another room filled with creatures. I was far enough 
away that even with my normal light radius, I would not have 
activated them.

I tinkered with my ring configuration trying to come up with a better 
mix of stuff. I ended up sticking with my original configuration and 
continued into the next room. NEARLY EVERYTHING WAS ACTIVATED WHEN I 
ENTERED THE ROOM! I jumped into a portal and went to town for more 
mana and to think about why all of a sudden the creatures were 
activated beyond the light radius as in the first level of hell. 
Suddenly I realized the answer. You *HAVE* to be wearing the darkness 
rings when you ENTER the level! I repaired Windy, got more mana and 
started back down the portal ready for a quick retreat if I was 
wrong. I wasn't. All the creatures were just standing there again 
(btw: light from the portal did not seem to effect them). I quickly 
cleared them out and went for laz. I was able to walk in the middle 
of his area, kill everything but him without a shot at me. After 
taking care of him, I headed to 16.

I took another trip to town for mana and repairs then started 
clearing 16. It was EASY! They never fired a shot! It was sometime 
around here that it dawned on me to take a screen cap (damn, sorry 
everyone, standing in laz's room would have been cool). Anyway here 
are some screen caps. You can click on them right now to view (direct 
pictures, not my page):


#1) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen03.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen03.gif</a>
This is me entering the upper left room in 16. (don't look at my cute 
butt!)

#2) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen04.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen04.gif</a>
Farther in same room.

#3) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen05.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen05.gif</a>
entering D's sq. I got careless and activated the two Knights (btw: 
notice the wierd refresh on the mana as I was hit in the middle of 
the screen cap).

#4) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen06.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen06.gif</a>
Knights killed, nobody else see's me.

#5) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen07.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen07.gif</a>
Everyone dead but Diablo. I teleported only this far away. He can't 
see me. The other light is from where Gorash died.


Anyway it was an eye opener for me. It was SO easy it is pitiful. The 
only drawback with this method is that #1) you need around 2-4 infra 
scrolls per level and #2) heaps of mana (which you need ANYWAY in a 
hell hell run).

If a level 1 player was carefull with stray arrows, he could easily 
clear hell hell alone with no armor. It's facinating yet sorta 
depressing. Throw away your armor folks, you don't need it. You only 
need 2 rings of Darkness which only cost 1 gold piece a piece.
