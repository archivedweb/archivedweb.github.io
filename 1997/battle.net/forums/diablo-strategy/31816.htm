<pre>It seems to me that, lately, people on this forum and
on battle.net have been spending an awful lot of
time trying to deciced who is cheating, what is &#34;legit&#34;,
etc.

And you gotta love those newbie posts that ask &#34;Is
this cheating?&#34;. Are these people looking for others
to justify their quasi-moral actions?

I think most people want to be considered &#34;legit&#34;.
But now the question is raised about what exactly
does  &#34;legit&#34; mean.

It seems like there has been a lot of effort to find out
what the public, in general, believes about cheating.
Like that survey done by that Code guy on this forum.
But what did he really accomplish with that survey?
OK, we know what some people think, and what
the average of their results is, but you are NEVER
going to get everybody on battle.net to agree about
what is cheating and what is legit. Unless Blizzard
came in and laid down the law, saying &#34;This is
cheating, and this is not... and if you are cheating,
we don't want you on battle.net&#34;. But I seriously doubt
that will ever happen.

My point is: I think we should stop wasting so much
time arguing about this issue. We need to decide
for ourselves what we think is cheating, and find
other people who agree with us, and play with
them. That is the whole point of clans, I know, but
we don't need to be part of a clan to play like this.
So in answer to the newbie question &#34;Is this cheating?&#34;,
it is, if you think it is. If you feel bad about doing it
then some part of you does believe it is cheating.

So once you have your cheating philosphy, join some
battle.net games and if someone asks &#34;are you legit?&#34;
or &#34;are you a cheater&#34;, say something like (for example)
&#34;I dupe items, but I don't change my characters' stats.
Got a problem with this?&#34;, and if they do, find another
game.

This all is just my input on the whole subject of
cheating and legitimacy. I expect to get flamed for
this, so flame away, I can take it :-)
