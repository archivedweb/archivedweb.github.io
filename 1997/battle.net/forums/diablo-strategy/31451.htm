I agree with you.  In my opionion, there could just be a Are You Sure 
safeguard put in that you have to reply Y to.  I've seen it in many 
games and could prevent these unfortunate errors.

&#62; I think you're still legit because you got screwed by some Blizzard 
&#62; programer's STUPID menu design, not because you couldn't legitimately 
&#62; get your stuff back.  I don't know what idiot put &#34;Start a New 
&#62; Game&#34; above (and logically, before) &#34;Restart in Town&#34;, 
&#62; but I'd like to Stone Curse him and use his head for archery 
&#62; practice.  OK, maybe that's a bit extreme...then again, maybe not.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; Also, who designed that screen that says &#34;Create a New Game&#34;? 
&#62;  What else are you gonna do at that point?  Why not just go straight 
&#62; to the next menu screen where you choose the difficulty level?  The 
&#62; two separate screens should be combined into one.
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway, I'm sure you get my main point--you didn't lose your stuff 
&#62; because of anything within the game itself, only something external 
&#62; to the game.  However, this is a good example of why when you lose 
&#62; your stuff, you should be very, very careful, and not do goofy things 
&#62; like trying to turn on the music.
&#62; 
&#62; IMHO, you're still legit, though others may disagree.
&#62; 
&#62; And restarting can be a fun challenge, but I understand if you're not 
&#62; into playing another 60 Laz runs just to find that Dreamflange 
&#62; again...</pre>
