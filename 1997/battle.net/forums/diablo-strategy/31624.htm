<pre>I agree, for the most part, with your working definition of cheating 
as something is that not an intentional part of the game.  This 
definition is broad enough to include outside/external hacks and 
cheats as well as internal bugs or anomalies, such as duping.  BTW, 
buying things from Wirt for 2/3 of the asking price (back before that 
bug got fixed) also constitutes cheating under this definition (since 
it apparently was not an intentional part of the game).

I understand your desire to see things in black-and-white, but your 
vision got a little &#34;gray&#34; when getting down to cases.  (I 
believe, by the way, that there is a gray area where whether 
something is cheating or not is arguable.)

You mention two examples: backing up and trading.  Backing up is 
using an external program to save multiplayer character data, and is 
not built into the game.  As such, any use of a backup program could 
be considered cheating.  I agree with you, however, that the use to 
which the program is put determines whether it is cheating.  I 
believe that Blizzard didn't put in a character save function because 
of their concern about duplicating items and people avoiding adverse 
events (i.e., losing items) during game play.  Blizzard, in fact, 
seems to be very helpful when people seek to transfer their 
characters to new computers.  Thus, I think that using the backup 
program to restore characters in case of hardware crashes, etc., is 
not cheating.

Trading also cannot be considered cheating, since tradining is 
obviously something Blizzard built into the game and intended to be 
an interactive function of the game.  As long as the items traded are 
legitimate and not duped, it isn't cheating (no matter the relative 
levels of the characters or power of the items).  When you include 
trading beyond 3 levels (which is an arbitrary limit or choice made 
by your clan, and not a game limitation or function) as cheating, you 
go astray.  It may make the game easier for the lower level 
character, but that is their choice, and one provided within the 
game.  The only game limitation on use is the stat requirement (and 
thus, extremely low level characters will be precluded from using 
certain items).  If Blizzard had wanted to restrict the use of 
certain items to certain levels, they would have done so (where have 
I heard this argument before).

If it helps, think of the high level item as a special gift or 
heirloom that the young warrior/mage/rogue learns to use over time 
(if the owner of the powerful item wants to give it up, that's their 
choice).  After all, young Arthur pulled Excalibur from the stone as 
a young man.

&#62; I want to clarify a few things here.
&#62; 
&#62;         First of all, it's 5 in the morning, I'm tired, but so 
&#62; annoyed at a trend I see developing here that I have to speak out! 
&#62; Cheating in any of it's forms is not acceptable to me, and that is 
&#62; why I only play in my guild.
&#62; 
&#62;         Cheating is defined, in my book, as doing anything that is 
&#62; not an INTENTIONAL part of the game. This means abviously that all 
&#62; hacks and trainers are cheating, as well as duping, because although 
&#62; it can be done within the game without the use of an external 
&#62; program, it wasn't placed there intentionally.
&#62; 
&#62;         Two things I don't see as cheating that I have seen listed 
&#62; here as cheating are, backing charachters up, and trading. First of 
&#62; all, I have seen this said a number of times, and I agree, Blizzard 
&#62; did not intend for system crashes and hd crashes to be a part of the 
&#62; game. I haven't actually used a backup program successfully yet (not 
&#62; for lack of trying) so i'm innocent whether it is cheating or not, 
&#62; but I do not think it is cheating. Second of all, I play in a legit 
&#62; league, with other legit players, then trading is not cheating, it is 
&#62; a way of life. If i find a dreamflange with my rogue, and my buddy 
&#62; the mage finds a windforce, you can believe we'll trade! But then, I 
&#62; have no fear that the item I am accepting is legit, because I know 
&#62; the people I trade with, and play with them frequently.
&#62; 
&#62;        Yes, I realize I am seeing black and white here, but that is 
&#62; the way I see the issue. You either cheat or you do not cheat, there 
&#62; is no middle ground, And I personally do not play with charachters 
&#62; that are cheated in any way.
&#62; 
&#62;        Now I realize that Darksniper is going to disagree with me on 
&#62; this one, but I also believe that recieving items from players well 
&#62; over your charachters level is another form of cheating, and is 
&#62; almost as bad as the rampant duping out there. In my guild we follow 
&#62; a 3 level trading rule, because otherwise the characther at the other 
&#62; end of the trade may be getting an item that is totally out of 
&#62; possibility for a charachter of his level to obtain legitimately. 
&#62; When the items a charachter is using far outclass the charachter, 
&#62; then the player is playing the item, not the charachter, and that is 
&#62; not the way the game was meant to be played.
&#62; 
&#62;       All you cheaters out there who are thinking, hey, it's my 50 
&#62; bucks, I'll play the way I want to play, YES, it is your 50 bucks, 
&#62; and I am not going to tell you you can't use your cheat programs, but 
&#62; don't use them with me. I believe that diablo is a game that just 
&#62; can't get boring, so I don't accept that excuse, the other one I 
&#62; despise is that the person can't win without them. That is bull, they 
&#62; just need a few more hours of practice, and they'll be able to handle 
&#62; the situation with little or no problem, and beyond that, Diablo is 
&#62; meant to be a challenge! if there was no challenge, there would be no 
&#62; fun! To me, these are the same kind of people who said,&#34; I'll 
&#62; never use physics in my real life, if they're going to force me to 
&#62; take it, then why shouldn't I cheat?&#34; only in this case it is 
&#62; worse, because no one is forcing you to play diablo. And to the final 
&#62; class of cheater out there, the cheater who cheats just to annoy 
&#62; people, I have little to say about this group of people except that 
&#62; they are a$$h@le's who deserve to be drug out into the street and 
&#62; shot for ruining the game that I spent my hard earned money on. I 
&#62; bought this game, and I should be free to enjoy it, and this class of 
&#62; cheater ruins my fun!@#^&@
&#62; 
&#62;         Let me summarize by saying that I will never be reconciled 
&#62; with the cheaters of the diablo world, and that if I could get rid of 
&#62; all the hack and cheat programs out there, I would!
&#62; 
&#62;         
&#62; 
&#62; time for a quick plug, If you agree with me, then the guild I am in 
&#62; may be for you, check us out, <a href="http://www.aodh.com/">http://www.aodh.com/</a> . We're always 
&#62; looking for a few good legit players.
