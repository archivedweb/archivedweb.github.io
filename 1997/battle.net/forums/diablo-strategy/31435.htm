<pre>ok correct me if i m wrong, the main point to ur post is &#34; MK or 
Cheating&#34;. the stealing thing is not valid cos people still do it 
now.

well, i dont see anything wrong with pk nor mk. (i dont do it but i 
see nothing wrong with it.) my philosophy is that, if i can killed by 
a legit pk, i ll just say i was not smart enough or i was not strong 
enough. mk can be avoided a lot of times if u r an experienced 
player. thats what the restart in town button is for. once u die, do 
not hesitate. and if u do, thats ur problem. 

i see pk this way, in real life (since this is a rpg) people back 
stab u all the time. u cant do anything about it. let say this guy is 
trying to rip u off for this item u just bought, u cant just 
duplicate it. if someone rob ur house, u lose ur stuff, as simple as 
that.

u also forgot a few things. without cheats there will be less pks. 
over half of the pk i know, pks cos they r bored of the game. and 
why? cos they cheated. its true some pks just like to kill players 
but u can always avoid them in private games. and if u do go to a 
public game, u ll have to take that chance. i think that chance adds 
to the suspense of the game, after all, u have to look behind ur back 
all the time.

as for heavens item being everywhere... thats great! that makes 
zodiac rings more wanted and rare. without cheats, the trading will 
be great! go to the trading post channel now, and see what they trade 
there. df rings, demonspike coat rings... all hacks. but imagine 
without cheats. all legit items. and people will appreciate the items 
given to them more, cos its the original thing, not just a duped 
version.

one more point. duels. imagine dueling without cheats. without level 
25 fireballs. without gods mode characters. woooo, that sound great.

ok one more... channel problems. look at all the level 40+ or even 
50+ characters r in a channel. this makes me sick! seeing my hard 
worked level 38 rogue there and all these level 40 cheaters in the 
room. and if u r a legit level 40+ character, i feel sorry for u, cos 
i dont think too many players will believe that u r legit, and i m 
getting there soon.

 do u ever hear what the topics r in public channels? they r pure 
stupid topics unrelated to diablo. i m not saying we should only chat 
about diablo in a channel but some topics just make me wanna... 
whatever. u might ask, so what does this have to do with cheating? 
well, if people r still interested in the game, then they would talk 
more about diablo instead of these topics u hear when u dial 1 900 
numbers. well they would still exist but not as much. cos those 
players just like to chat. they dont play games.

damn, another one just poped up. clans. without cheats clan will be 
even better. imagine a war between a nonpk clan(sort of ironic)  VS a 
pk clan? damn that would be fun. but now? i dont even know how to 
kill a cheater. we have to aviod them by using private games and 
channels. now that really sux!

my conclusion is, i dont see anything good about cheating. btw, since 
everyone seems to have a different definition for cheating, this is 
mine. &#34; not playing the game the way it was suppose to be played 
by blizzard.&#34;
