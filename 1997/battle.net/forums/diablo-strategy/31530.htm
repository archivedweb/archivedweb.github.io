&#62; This is what happened just about 15 min. ago:
&#62; 
&#62; I joined a game created by a mage named Darksnider (yes, D, not P)
&#62; It was called Legit no cheaters no pk no lag (or something like that).
&#62; 
It seems that the least mature and most blatantly annoying pk's hang 
out in the channels where newbies frequent and I believe that's the 
reason so many people refuse to play public games.

&#62; Actually he said more stuff like that, everything really clever. But 
&#62; since my character &#34;Zeozulu&#34; was MADE to encounter such 
&#62; lifeforms, I actually am happy that I met him. This might be a reason 
&#62; so many players hate PKs.
&#62; I really have nothing against an artistically done P-Kill, but this 
&#62; one surely was a disgrace for all PKs on battle.net.
&#62; 
&#62; Hmm... who else here has met such poor_fellows? Are they very common? 
&#62; I hope not... naah... humanity can't be THAT sick... or, can it?
&#62; 
My take on the situation, as a PK (and, sometimes a PKK) is it all 
comes down to your attitude and take on things. The are some poor 
dweebs out there that get some sort of sick charge in their addled 
simian brains out of spoiling fun for other people. The are typically 
PK's with duped weapons and armor and ridulously hacked stats, some 
even turn god mode on... As a reasonably intelligent lifeform, I 
cannot fathom any reason other than being a mean little $#&#37;@! 
that &#34;playing&#34; in this manner could be justified with. 

Some cheating may be acceptable to some people, but entering into 
public competition with others who have no desire to cheat, kill or 
be killed (esp by cheaters) is the epitome of honorless behavior.
There are PKs out there that, like me, are bound by honor. I only 
kill 
within 2-3 levels of my own, at extremes, and I *NEVER* cheat. No 
dupes, hacks, mods, everything I have and am is earned. Usually I 
only PK people I have a personal reason to, and If I have no such 
reason, I immediately res them after taking the ear, and leave the  
gold.

Ways to protect against the honorless : 1) Buy expensive items - You 
will lose much gold in the resale, but likely it is less than you 
would lose if you were carring it and PK'ed.... tha honor bound only 
want the ear anyway. 2)Upon being killed IMMEDIATELY restart from 
town, or better yet, exit the game to avoid being ressed and re-
killed over and over losing more gold each time. 3) If there is a 
player who is a SERIOUS twit, to a /whois if the twink appears in a 
room, and spread the persons name to PKK and let newbies know not to 
play with him. You can link a changed name to a battle.net account 
number to keep  up with the person's identity changes. 4)Get involved 
in a guild, or stick to private games... either one will be a 
surefire way to keep Cheating PKs from mesing up your hard-earned 
character.
