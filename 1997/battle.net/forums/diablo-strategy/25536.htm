<pre>&#62; Someone actually killed Diablo 30+ times just to find out his
&#62; hit points in normal, nightmare, and hell modes.  

Hey, that was me!  :)

&#62; I forgot the
&#62; site, but I think Fire Made Flesh posted it.  

My site my site!!!!  come view it at:
<a href="http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo.html">http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo.html</a>

&#62; Anyway, normal,
&#62; he has 1666 hit pts, nightmare 5000+ and hell 6000+.  If he's
&#62; immune to a certain type of spell, then there is no hope with
&#62; that spell to do even a slight damage.  Resistance means that
&#62; the spell can do only 25&#37; damage of what it states.  Try to 
&#62; kill him with holy bolt, it'll will stun him, eventhough it doesn't
&#62; do as much damage as fireball.  Also, he's immune to bone spirit,
&#62; and flame wave doesn't seem to do the damage as it professes.

The reason flame wave doesn't always do the damage it says is because 
it has &#34;gaps&#34; as does fire wall.  You can walk through both a 
fire wall and a flame wave without taking damage, so don't assume 
that throwing one down the hall causes him to be hit.  Also, a minor 
bug I've noticed, if you hit monsters too fast, it seems that not all 
of the hits do damage.  But, like you said, holy bolts work best, 
since they both stun him, and also they do not hit teammates who 
might otherwise get hit with friendly fire.

2 or 3 mages all hitting him with holy bolts should keep him stunned 
enough that you could kill him without going through more than 2 mana 
potions in hell/hell

Also, I've kind of invented/adopted a new playing style.  I saw 
someone post a while ago saying they were seeing how far they could 
get with a character without dying.  It's along those lines.  So far, 
I'm up to level 28, have 1 dot, and have had damn lucky item seeds.  
(found a thinking cap and two hidden shrines early on)  If you're 
wondering, I kind of made a rules page, it's up for viewing at
