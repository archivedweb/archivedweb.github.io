<pre>&#62; &#34;cheating&#34; or
&#62; &#34;legit.&#34;  The only thing that should change that is a 

I think the various clans in existence that I've browsed do a semi-
good job of defining those terms.  Personally, I don't want to join a 
clan, because most &#34;legit&#34; clans I have seen discourage game-
play with non-members, which is totally unnecessary.  At the same 
time, you can only be truly certain of the definitions for the above 
if you stick to one clan.

In my own mind, cheating is any act that is committed outside of the 
original capabilities of the game, or anything that was otherwise not 
intended to be in the game.  For example, the ability to arbitrarily 
modify your character stats, or &#34;dupe&#34; of items, or 
&#34;God&#34;[1] mode, or backing up characters[2].

Outside of that, anything else goes.  If you would like to play a 
game where as a low-level character, you adventure with a group of 
high-levels, so that you can get cool items, so be it.  If you like 
to kill other players, that's within the realm of the game world as 
well.  You see, I can easily imagine these two scenarios in any one 
of the role-playing/fantasy worlds that are played on paper, or read 
in books.  Diablo is an RPG of sorts, isn't it?  An example might 
illustrate better:

I'm a great fan of the original Dragonlance Chronicles.  In the 
story, I can quite readily imagine a seasoned warrior like Flint, 
taking on the charge of being a battle tutor for the knight, Sturm 
when Sturm was just starting out.  Flint might even give him the 
occasional magic item, just because it was so dangerous where they 
were going.  But Flint would also recognize that to give Sturm too 
much would &#34;spoil&#34; him, and prevent him from becoming a truly 
great warrior.  Later on, Kitiara, one of the original band of 
adventurers betrayed everyone and went to serve the Dark Queen.  As a 
consequence, she eventually engages Sturm on the battle field, and 
emerges victorious--she killed Sturm.

So in conclusion, my preference is to play Diablo as if it were 
really an RPG.  I define a role or &#34;philosophy&#34; for my 
character (which usually mirrors my real views) and I play that role. 
 I can accept characters doing things that are &#34;believable&#34; 
in the game world.  I realize that this approach is not for everyone 
though. For example, I was killed by two different PKers yesterday.  
What I found with both was that they were either anti-social, of very 
low intelligence, very immature, or all three.  You can tell this by 
trying to talk to them (even after you die!)  It's really quite 
amusing, in a sad way.  So, for these people, I can definitely not 
see them enjoying a good _role-playing_game_ or playing with any 
amount of sense of &#34;fair-play&#34; or intelligence for that 
matter.

Anyway, Diablo is a really cool and enjoyable game when it's played 
correctly.  That's my 2 &#34;pages&#34; worth! =)

[1] I think God-mode is fine, if you're new to the game, and are 
playing in single-player mode, or in a solo game.  But to those who 
do... playing the game the way it was meant to be played is much more 
enjoyable, I would think.
[2] I am using backups in case of a system crash, but I've played 
many hours already and no crashes yet, so I probably won't be using 
it in the future.</pre>
