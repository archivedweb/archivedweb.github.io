<blockquote>
<pre>Sounds well worth trying...but here are few sceptical remarks.

(1) Some people tried the following experiment a while back:
generate a random sequence of integers, give them one by one
to a subject, ask them to predict the next integer, and find
the pattern. Supposedly, some subjects came up with a hypothesis,
found that it worked, and would not belive the experimenter
when finally told they were being given random numbers. (I have
to admit when I tried it out on someone, they told me that the
numbers were random...) Anyway, the point is that Diablo is random
and it's easy to read patterns into a random sequence of events,
depending on what does or does not happen to show up.

(2) I've seen any number of theories on how to use shrines
For example, how hidden shrines always hit an item with
durability of 40 more than the others --- and reports that
people used this rule 10 times in a row. It doesn't seem random,
but when I try it, it doesn't work for me --- I still don't
know how to ensure that the shrine won't hit my thinking cap.
Why do enchanted shrines always seem to hit my stone curse spell
or my chain lightning spell? (grr....) It sure doesn't seem
random to me. Someone said they'd found it hit a spell that you'd
used a lot (is it really keeping track of how many times
I've used chain-lighning or inferno? -- I doubt it) or it was more
likely to hit a spell that was hotkeyed (sounds like a plausible
explanation -- I do always have stone curse and CL hotkeyed).
OK -- last enchanted shrine I found, I changed my hot
keys (to inferno, heal other, phase, and charged bolt), fired
off a million inferno spells, touched the shrine...and my
chain lighting dropped from lvl 9 to lvl 8. (the previous
two shrines had hit stone curse) Hmm...maybe I should have fired
off even more infernos?...I WAS chain-lighning my way through
hell/cats just before I found that shrine..a sorceror told me
that enchanted shrines had hit his charged bolt 10 times in a row
...why can't it hit MY charged bolt??...is the
shrine reading my mind?...does it KNOW I hate charged bolt
and love chain lighting?...

(3) I've seen people report that different classes find different
items, or that rogues find &#34;better&#34; items than sorcerors. 
Well,
my rogue has a hard time finding anything decent, and my sorceror
(who's lower lvl than my rogue) has found tons of good stuff.

(4) Bliz's standard answer to what determines the quality of items
found in the dungeon, is that it depends mainly on the level and
slightly on the difficulty, and the quality of what's sold depends
on the character level. They have never so much as hinted that
character class, character equipment, or some other variable is
relevant. (I don't know if they have explicitly denied it though
-- and even if something about your character is used in generating
a random seed, it's hard to see how that could lead to any
systematic correlation). Of course, what Bliz says in Tech
Support about how the game works and what people experience in
practice sometimes makes you wonder if they're talking about
a different game.
