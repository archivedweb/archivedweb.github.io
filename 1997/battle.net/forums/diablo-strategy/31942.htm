<pre>  Hi there! I have been reading other peoples posts about funny 
occurences and many are very amusing.I was thinking that if anyone 
had a funny thing happen to them or a funny story to tell or even 
something made up but could happen dealing with the game just post it 
as a response under my post. I will start us off with....hmmm....ok 
how about a PKs Hot Keys List. I'm guessing one might go kind of like 
the this.

F1: MU HU HA HA!! I will kill you all!!!!
F2:Gosh! I am soooo sorry! It was like you just jumped in front of my 
sword!
F3:Wow! My sword still is sharp....I was getting to think it was a 
little dull. Thanks for letting me test it on you.
F4:My Lord!!! I think by Bow is posessed! I swear I didnt shoot you 
when your back was turned dozens of times on purpose!
F5:Whoa! where did your leg go! Oh yeah...I did that. Well call me 
butterfingers!
F6:Why did I kill you?? I tell you why! Because I felt like it!! HA 
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

If anyone else wats to add on to this feel free or if there is any 
other funny things you know about write them as a response to this 
post. I will see if I can remember any other funny things or think 
some up. Bye Bye.</pre>
