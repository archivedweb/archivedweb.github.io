<blockquote>
<pre>   OK, I missed the last couple of days on the forum while getting my 
car repaired, so I didn't have much chance to be in on the big 
debates. So, with apologies to Kramer and Lorax, I'd like to toss in 
my 2$'s worth. (Inflation, y'know?)

  This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now, and 
I've gotta get it out. Lots of people seem to think only in terms of 
Good/Bad, Legit/Cheat, Co-op/PK. Each duality is considered the same 
(ie Good=Legit=Co-op; Bad=Cheat=PK), but I think we really need to 
think along two axis instead of one. I once played a great deal of 
AD&D, and Diablo has a lot of similarities to the old tabletop 
classic. So, what I'm considering here is a WHOLE NEW idea: using the 
AD&D alignment system to kill two birds with one stone: (1) quickly 
divide people up into those you do(n't) want to play with, and (2) 
make cheating part of the roleplaying experience available to Diablo 
players. First off, Legit/Cheat isn't about good and evil, it's about 
following the rules. Thus, Lawful and Chaotic are the new terms of 
the day. Co-op/PK can be described as good and evil, though. Either 
you work with people, or you prey upon them. Even this isn't iron-
clad, however; remember duelling, self-defense, and avenging honor 
are &#34;good&#34; reasons for player killing.

Some examples, which may be construed as &#34;picking on&#34; if you 
wish, although such is not my intent.

   Lawful Good: DarkSniper, obviously. Also, however remember that 
less verbose posters also qualify as LG, just because you don't 
preach a sermon, doesn't mean you can't keep the faith.
   Lawful Neutral: I've yet to see this creature. Stays away from 
cheats, but has no compunctions against wasting a fellow player, 
especially if they are annoying in some manner. May attack from 
suprise, but probably won't.
   Lawful Evil: The image projected by the Priests of Chaos guild. 
They don't cheat, but they'll use every trick in the book to kill 
other players. I can respect that. (Not that I'd knowingly play in a 
game with one.)
   Neutral Good: These are the newbie-helpers. They dupe things, or 
hand out unneeded items to new players. Or, perhaps, like myself, 
maintain back-ups in case of crashing.
   True Neutral: Haven't seen this person yet either. Probably just 
not interested in anything beyond single player, though.
   Neutral Evil: These are the people who like killing other players, 
and are just to that stage where it would be a little easier if they 
could dupe off that ring they found, or use Deye to pick easy 
targets. They stack the deck, but don't use marked cards . . . . yet.
   Chaotic Good: Code Myster. He uses the cheats, he admits to it, 
and isn't ashamed of it. But, he doesn't hurt other players, so good 
for him.
   Chaotic Neutral: This guy doesn't play Diablo, he plays SNES games 
with a game genie. He wants every advantage possible, and doesn't 
care to bother with other players either way.
   Chaotic Evil: The scum of battlenet. Godmode PKers. TownKillers. 
These are the people who use Raymond's Trainer to cripple your 
character, then copy all your items, then let you get monster killed 
in Laz's chamber. STAY AWAY!

   Some of you probably think this post is a little silly, and I 
agree, it is a little silly. But then, having a huge, hostile fight 
over a computer game is a little silly as well. Thanks for reading 
this far.
