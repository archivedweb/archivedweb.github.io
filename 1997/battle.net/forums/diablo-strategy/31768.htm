<pre>I hear you, man!!  I keep running into this problem also.  &#34;Fools 
rush in where angels fear to tred.&#34;  It seems as though, for most 
warriors, their only strategy is to run in and hack at everything.  
Actually, I don't mind that so much, but I hate it when they keep 
crossing my arrow stream, especially when they complain afterward.

I now tell them that I am trying to be aware of their position on the 
screen, and they need to be aware of me and where I'm firing.  If 
they don't want to get hit, then they cannot just charge blindly 
across the screen.  The best way seems to be to divide up the room--
he takes the left, you take the right.  And, when you can, you pick 
off distance-fighting monsters for him.  Alternatively, he keeps an 
eye on you and rushes in when you get swarmed.  That's about the best 
solution I've found so far--the trouble is, you have to go through it 
every time you play with a new person  :P

As for your question: 
&#62;if the dummy steps into my line of active 
&#62; fire should I just keep firing till he moves or drops?

I'd say it depends, but if someone comes between me and a unique 
monster, and I've clearly been firing at it and I think they're just 
trying to steal my kill, I'll keep firing till they move or drop.  It 
bugs me when they run between you and your target, expecting you to 
stop, while they collect whatever goody the unique drops (after 
you've already weakened it for them).

Anyway, that's my $0.02--the warrior and the rogue should be 
'natural' partners, as one can compensate for the weaknesses of the 
other, but it doesn't always seem to work out that way.</pre>
