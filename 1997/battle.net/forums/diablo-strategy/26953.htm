<pre>I just noticed that all the legits are making a big scene about 
cheaters that kill you. Well, don't think that all of us are PK's and 
TK's (the only reason I use TK is so i can teleport around town 
rather than walk, heh heh heh...). I am a cheater with this character 
(NOT WITH MY IPX CHARACTERS!!! THESE ARE LEGITS YOU CAN LOOK 
SOMETIME!), but I have never taken an ear unless it was someone who 
gave me a hard time, or wanted an honest duel (Which I gave them, 
mind you--no god mode or godly mana-what's the point of dueling if 
you are in no danger at all?). I spend most of my time on BNET 
chatting, or assisting other players who are having trouble. Don't 
make a scene about me cheating- Yes, I know it's a bad habit, but 
people, there have to be a few good natured cheaters out there-and 
I'd rather be one of them. Don't respond to this post by saying 
&#34;Cheaters Suck&#34;, because if any PK'ing cheater reads it, 
he/she will most likely kill you and ressurect you in a firewall. Not 
pretty or fun, so please-I don't want anyone to get hurt, alright? If 
you want, you can challenge me to a duel and I WILL use one of my 
legit characters--though you have to remember, me and my IPX buddies 
only game once or twice a week, so they are severely 
underexperienced. Thank you for taking the time to read this.</pre>
