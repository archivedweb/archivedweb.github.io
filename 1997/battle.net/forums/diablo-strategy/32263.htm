<pre>Based on my experience and recent posts, you gain experience for each 
monster you or your &#34;agent&#34; (i.e., golem, guardian) damages.  
I do not think you gain experience for stone cursing a monster 
(although I have not conducted any experiments to confirm that).

You also get an equal share of that monster's relative XP value with 
everyone else who damaged that monster, regardless of the relative 
amounts of damage/hits.  The actual XP each person gains, however, is 
not necessarily going to be the same.  I believe this is because the 
monster's relative XP value to each person may be different because 
of the cumulative kill effect.  As you know, as you kill more 
monsters, you get fewer XP per kill, eventually receiving none.  In 
other words, the monster's relative XP value (relative to YOU) 
decreases with the number of kills.  

For example, my theory is that if two people both damage and help 
kill a given monster, each will receive 50&#37; of what they would 
have received in XP had they killed it by themselves.  Thus, if the 
Player 1 would have received 8000 XP, and Player 2 would have 
received 8600 XP, then in the above situation Player 1 would receive 
4000 XP and Player 2 would receive 4300 XP.

I believe Strech6 (a fellow Snake!) recently posted in the Tech 
Support forum about an experiment along the above lines.  He and a 
friend both damaged a monster.  His friend hit one or two times, 
while Strech6 did most of the damage.  Strech6 received only 4000 XP, 
while his friend received 4300 XP (I'm not sure about the exact 
numbers, but his friend did received more XP). This is consistent 
with my analysis. 

That's my theory, but I haven't tested it.  I would welcome any 
observations by others.

&#62; I have a question for all you Diablo experts out there concerning
&#62; the delegation of experience in multi-player games.
&#62; 
&#62; When multiple people are attacking monsters, how is experience
&#62; allocated?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I've been trying to figure this out.  It seemed to me at first that
&#62; if 2 players were on the same screen as a monster and the monster
&#62; died, then both gained EXP...however after some experimenting only
&#62; sometimes did that occur...
&#62; 
&#62; So I have a new theory that seems to hold, and that is:
&#62; 
&#62;   You gain experience from a monsters death if you have somehow
&#62; contributed to damaging that creature...so if you hit it for 1 damage,
&#62; you get experience when it dies. No matter if you kill it or not.
&#62; 
&#62;   Is this correct?
&#62; 
&#62;   Also, if that is to a point correct, what about spells like golem
&#62; and guardian or stone curse?  Golem and guardian are sort of indirect
&#62; ways to damage a creature so would that count toward gaining EXP from
&#62; a monsters death? And what about stone curse? If you stone something,
&#62; do you get exp when it dies? If so, then that would lead me to believe
&#62; that you gain EXP if you hit a creature with ANYTHING, rather than
&#62; actually doing damage to it...
