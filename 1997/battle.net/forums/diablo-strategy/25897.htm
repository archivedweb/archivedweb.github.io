<pre>Heh-heh!  I can sympathize with the at work eMAIL.  I am also one of 
the cursed who must actually work for a living.  Luckily, I can get 
away with some monster bashing during off hours and lunch.  I have 
yet to get a decent machine for home and I don't have 2-3k to cough 
up at the moment.  I keep getting these things in the mail asking, ur 
demanding, money.  Bills I think they're called :-)

Anyway, it's nice to see another who posts intelligent responses.  We 
seem to be somewhat of a rare breed.  Keep up the good work Melissa!

Drop me a line sometime and maybe we can hook up for a game or two.  
But I'll warn you, if I see a unique mace get dropped it'll be every 
mage for him/her self!  &#60;kidding&#62;

&#62; Thanks for the compliment Nordell.  I try only to post when I have 
&#62; something intelligent to contribute.  As for my E-mail, I guess I 
&#62; don't post it cause it's my e-mail on my job, but I'm not trying to 
&#62; stay anonymous.  I usually look quite frequently here to see if 
&#62; anyone commented on one of my posts.
&#62; 
&#62; And regarding still searching for the Dreamflange - hopefully that's 
&#62; not why they call it the Dreamflange - hopefully it's not just a 
&#62; dream!  (To us legit clean players at least.)

&#62; &#62; &#62; 1.  Yes, single player mode is limited, the higher difficulty levels 
&#62; &#62; &#62; should have been carried over to single player. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 2.  My solution to that is I play multiplayer by myself, which is 
&#62; &#62; &#62; more challenging than single player in more than one way.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 3.  Yes there's LOTS of cheating and player killing on B.net, which I 
&#62; &#62; &#62; think is TRULY sad.  The couple of solutions I can think of is join a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; legit, cooperative guild and only get into passworded games, or find 
&#62; &#62; &#62; someone to play via modem with.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 4.  As for B.net being unstable, I don't use it but all games have 
&#62; &#62; &#62; some element of instability and crashing nowadays.  I think Diablo is 
&#62; &#62; &#62; not as bad as some games in the past have been.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 5.  And as for the user interface, I love it, it's simple and works 
&#62; &#62; &#62; for this game as far as my opinion goes. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Don't be too discouraging, I think it's obvious that this is a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; seriously addictive game.  It's what I can't wait to get home from 
&#62; &#62; &#62; work for.

&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; I agree with NateTheGreat, Diablo kicks all other game's ass and you 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; would be stupid not to buy it.  Well not stupid just Buy it, I have 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; convinced all of my friends to buy it and I hope you will too...  
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; Work hard at those music lessons so you can get the game.  BTW, what 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; do you take, piano, sax,....?

&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; Ok, I bougth Diablo in January and... I still play it. IMHO, Diablo 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; is as revolutionary as Doom was 4 years ago. Maybe more.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; However! There are a lot of bad point which must be said.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; - On single mode, Diablo sucks.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; - Newbies are targeted by many peoples with differents intentions.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; - The &#34;cheats&#34;! :(
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; - B'net is definitly not stable.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; - The user interface is nice, but... very limited.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; At least those are the point which ennoy me. I repeat I continue to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; play Diablo despite them, but they exist.
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; &#62; NoirDelire
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Good comments Melissa!  Especially about the cheaters on battle.net.  
&#62; &#62; If the original poster is reading, I would recommend you talk to us 
&#62; &#62; here before going out on battle.net so that we can tell you what to 
&#62; &#62; look out for.  It's almost like real life...lot's of sick people and 
&#62; &#62; lots of people not to trust! 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; But, the bottom line is that Diablo is probably one of the most 
&#62; &#62; addictive games ever made, all you need to do is find the right 
&#62; &#62; people to play with and enjoy!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; By the way Melissa, why no return eMAIL address :-(
