<pre>Number 13,  regarding teleporting in town should be 15 say its 
cheating and 7 say its not.  Also, this is skewed since many people 
did not know that teleporting in town is not allowed without TKill or 
other supplementary software.  So the actual figure should be an even 
higher number say its cheating.

Just that correction.  By the way, that was a good idea for a post.

So if the majority rules, then only Deye and Teleporting in town were 
the two cheating actions.  Which I would agree with.  Of course, they 
are grey areas.  Or is it gray areas.  Hmmmm Grey vs. Gray, its kind 
of a gre/ay area. . .

&#62; First off, I want to apologize for getting this summary posted so

&#62; (note: I'm hurring here, I may have counted some of these wrong).
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok so what does this mean? DarkSniper Aside (I'll deal with you at 
&#62; the bottom DS) I thought it would be intersting on getting peoples 
&#62; input as to some issues I concider &#34;grey&#34; areas. Again, I 
&#62; ABSOLUTLY am not trying to defend cheating or not... just to point 
&#62; out that we *ALL* have opinions on what is legit or not. I was 
&#62; supprised with quite a few of the replies up there.
&#62; 
&#62; I think alot of people enjoyed reading others replies as they made 
&#62; very valid points both ways on subjects I thought would be 
&#62; &#34;landslide&#34; YES's or NO's. The closest split was on the issue 
&#62; of #7, Deye. The ones I was most suppried about would have to be 
&#62; #6,#9,#14 without a doubt.
&#62; 
&#62; So I'll bet more than a few are wanting me to post the anwers to my 
&#62; own questions. Here goes:
&#62; 
&#62; #1). &#34;accept Gold&#34;
&#62; This is not cheating. It may ruin the fun for those who use the gold 
&#62; as they are able to gain items they would not otherwise be able to 
&#62; have.
&#62; 
&#62; #2). &#34;accept Items&#34;
&#62; This is not cheating as long as the item is legit. It may ruin the 
&#62; players fun though.
&#62; 
&#62; #3). &#34;higher level chars buy items&#34;
&#62; This is a grey area. You cannot access something so you are having 
&#62; others access it for you. To this I would have to say, No, not 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #4). &#34;elixers?&#34;
&#62; This is again like #3, a grey area. I cringe to give elixers to 
&#62; people below level 26 as blizz did not intend for them to get them at 
&#62; that level... I lean towards a YES here.
&#62; 
&#62; #5). &#34;clear levels&#34;
&#62; Not cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #6). &#34;shopping&#34;
&#62; Absolutely is cheating. I think this is bending the rules of Diablo 
&#62; to restart hundreds of games in order to &#34;ramdomly&#34; get an 
&#62; item you wish. What is the difference between this and restarting 
&#62; games until you get one with &#34;easier&#34; creatures to get your 
&#62; exp? It is cheating (and I'm guiltly of it)
&#62; 
&#62; #7). &#34;use Deye&#34;
&#62; It is a cheat as it is an external program used to access something 
&#62; not availible in the spec of the game. However, I use it from time to 
&#62; time.
&#62; 
&#62; #8). &#34;lower players to portal&#34;
&#62; Not cheating. Blizz could have restricted players of too low a level 
&#62; from entering the portal.
&#62; 
&#62; #9). &#34;only purpose is to hold extra items?&#34;
&#62; I feel VERY strongly about this... IT IS CHEATING. I look at it like 
&#62; this, you are given a unique inventory space you have to fit items 
&#62; into within the game. You have to manage your inventory space to 
&#62; determine what items you intend to carry, what you have to give up 
&#62; etc. If blizz wanted you to have a zillion items, they would have 
&#62; given you inventory &#34;pages&#34; to fill up. Nope, blizz gave a 
&#62; static inventory space. Using other chars to expand this space is 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #10). &#34;transfer items&#34;
&#62; Not cheating because if you find an item and it's legit, you should 
&#62; be able to put it on another char that you use as long as that char 
&#62; is *NOT* just a char to hold the item.
&#62; 
&#62; #11). &#34;Pk with the Nova spell?&#34;
&#62; I threw this one in... it's unethical but is not cheating. (hacked 
&#62; Nova is though!)
&#62; 
&#62; #12). &#34;Portal Kill someone?&#34;
&#62; Not cheating... very unethical, but not cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; #13). &#34;Teleport in town?&#34;
&#62; Definitly cheating. However, most people do not know of a bug in 
&#62; v1.03/1.04 that allows you to cast a spell in town without external 
&#62; cheats (is true! Rogue can cast Repair skill/staff recharge also). 
&#62; Either way you look at it, it's cheating (I have done this).
&#62; 
&#62; #14). &#34;backup chars&#34;
&#62; Absolutly cheating. Blizzard originally gave out the means to move 
&#62; char files to those who needed to either &#34;reformat&#34; their HD 
&#62; or get a new computer. I follow the Tech support base and really have 
&#62; not heard them state that this is also to be used for general 
&#62; backups. Another way to think about it, it's not in your game manual 
&#62; now is it? Nope, it was not intended to be backed up. (I backup 
&#62; though).
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway this is how I feel about it. Please, if you disagree with me 
&#62; or other people who have posted, do not flame anyone.... everyone has 
&#62; stated great opinions here. In the end, we all seem to have a 
&#62; different view of this expecially on the minor issues. Just be very 
&#62; careful when stating your &#34;legitimacy&#34; that you may 
&#62; unintentionally offend someone who holds a slightly different view 
&#62; than your own.
&#62; 
&#62; To close, HAVE FUN! Diablo has been one of the most amazing games I 
&#62; have ever played. Sometimes we tend to forget that while getting into 
&#62; these discussions. For myself.... I'm gonna go play more!

&#62; PS:
&#62; To DarkSniper:
&#62; 
&#62;     You are the most paraniod person I have seen in a long time! Do I 
&#62; scare you that much? Why do you see me as your nemesis? No matter 
&#62; what I post whether for good or bad, you are RIGHT there in my face. 
&#62; I have been really trying hard to avoid flaming you hard over this 
&#62; because you are really starting to annoy me. I can't believe your 
&#62; second post in the replies trying to twist this into some other 
&#62; argument about legitimacy. My thanks to Red Herring for his post at 
&#62; least giving me the benefit of this summary before saying anything. 
&#62; 
&#62;     You do *NOT* own this channel. I will not back down either (the 
&#62; raw amount email to me today from others shows me that even though we 
&#62; are not in agreement, there are alot of people who enjoy seeing me 
&#62; around here).
&#62; 
&#62;      Get over yourself DarkSniper, becomming the &#34;eugene&#34; of 
&#62; Stragety is not your best move.
