<pre>Ok, I want to begin by saying you've made some great points and I 
respect your point of view.

But I want to add to it.  Yes there is a continuum, but that's not 
all.  It has a divide in the middle.  A split.  There are different 
'shades' of cheater and a variety of legits, however cheaters and 
legits are separate classes of people.  Even those closest to the 
center of the line, are either cheaters or legits.  They made not be 
full on cheaters, and the legits may not be totally passionate about 
it, but they ARE different.

I agree with DarkSniper in much of his commentary, anything acheived 
by duping or cheating otherwise, is not earned, not deserved.  The 
entire point of the excellent items is that they are rewards because 
you have succeeded in a quest, or killed a unique creature, or 
whatever.  They are designed to be worked for.

I am a very logical-minded person.  Therefore, I detest above all 
else that which defeats the purpose of something.  The purpose of 
Diablo is to use one's own cunning, ability and power to overcome the 
game's challenges.  Cheating makes the game easier, thereby totally 
rending the purpose void.  And to be honest, that pisses me off.

Cheating in a game is like changing the rules.  So, if you win 
Diablo, but you duped off someone for a King's Sword of Wizardry, for 
example, then you haven't really won the game, you've won a different 
game you set up yourself, with an unfair bias towards your chance of 
winning.

To finish up (this has been my longest post), cheating undermines and 
destroys the way Diablo was designed to be played.  Maybe they do 
enjoy it, and that's their business.  But if I come into contact with 
one of them, I'm gonna do whatever I can to stop it.
