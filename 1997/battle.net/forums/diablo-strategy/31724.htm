<blockquote>
<pre>&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

No, as long as it is not duped or the giving player has the gold 
cheat active. If somebody has gold and wants to give it away, why not 
? One point though, which also applies to some of the following 
questions: You should not accept &#34;presents&#34; from characters 
with a level which is _much_ higher than your own. It would not be 
cheating, but &#34;bad style&#34; and spoil the game.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

see previous question. As long as the items are legit and as long as 
we do not speak about a level 40 warrior giving his master's sword of 
haste to a level 1 warrior.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

see above. all questions concern the same problem.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

Why not ? If you want to cooperate ? It is not cheating, it merely 
spoils the fun for the lower level character. But if he wants it ...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?

The game allows it, so it is not cheating. And when you are at level 
40 or above, the chances of getting anything good from Griz or Wirt 
are so small that it should not be a problem to try your luck four or 
five extra times ...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

No. Normally, you should be able to guess the &#34;power&#34; of a 
given chat channel member from his level. But the cheater problem has 
led to the fact that you cannot be sure whether a given player is a 
cheater or not. Deye lets you check which players are cheaters and 
which ones are not, so that you can ask the right people when you 
want to start a &#34;legit&#34; game - and do not have to waste time 
convincing players to start a game with you, only to find out that 
you have _yet again_ invited a multi-obs-zodiac-godly-plate-cheater 
into your game ...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

Game allows it, thus not cheating. Though it has to be said that I do 
not believe it to be &#34;good style&#34;...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?

Game allows it, thus not cheating. Blizzard should have provided some 
kind of &#34;Bank&#34; where you could store a set amount of items 
.... (continued)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

... which you want to keep or transfer to another of your characters. 
No, this is also not cheating. In fact, it is necessary because it 
seems that you find your Windforce always with the warrior and your 
godly shield always with the rogue. 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

Huh ? Never heard of that one. 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

Well, I do not like PKing but I have to say that it is not exactly 
cheating. But if somebody did it to me, I would drive over to his 
house and .... 
I just _hate_ PKers. Sorry, just my personal opinion.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

yes. Game does not allow it.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

No ! Blizzard just has not thought about the fact that modern PCs are 
just too likely to crash and take every character with them into 
Nirvana. Backups are not cheating.</pre>
