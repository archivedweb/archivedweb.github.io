&#62; POP QUIZ:  Are you a Gamer, a Player or a Nerd?
&#62; 
&#62; Standard disclaimer: This post has no strategy what-so-ever.  Nor do 
&#62; hardly any of my posts these days.  I like to help newbies now and 
&#62; again, but the strategy stuff has all been covered for the most part 
&#62; and now days its just re-hash.  Not that there isnt an obscure tip 
&#62; yet to be discovered, Im sure there is.  I just dont play enough 
&#62; anymore to discover it.  So this is what you can expect from me: 
&#62; ramblings, jests and the occasional flame.
&#62; 
&#62; Ok boys and girls, here is a pop quiz from Woody.  Please be honest 
&#62; in your answers, the results will be kept confidential.  Also, no 
&#62; looking at your neighbors paper because, well, your only cheating 
&#62; yourself.
&#62; 
&#62; Instructions: This is a multiple choice quiz.  On a piece of paper, 
&#62; with a #2 pencil, read each question thoroughly and record your 
&#62; answer.  Grades will be handed out at the end.
&#62; 
&#62; Sample Question: 
&#62; Question #2: Your real life personality and that of your Diablo 
&#62; persona are
&#62; A)  Incomparable.  I dont have an identifiable persona
&#62; B)  Similar.  My ethical and moral values generally tend to be the 
&#62; same, aside from an occasional pkill :)
&#62; C)  Blurred beyond salvation.  I regularly confuse the two.  I catch 
&#62; myself trying to fireball people that drive real slow in the fast 
&#62; lane.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, in the above example, if DarkSniper was taking the quiz, his 
&#62; thought process might be along these lines.  &#34;Hmmm, I just wrot 
&#62; tha essae on Oliver Twist titled Oliver Twist: If he d a WF, he d 
&#62; sure as $#!T woulda got more porrige! so I guess I d pick c.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Get it?  Good.  Well, what are you waiting for?  The clock is ticking
&#62; 
&#62; Question #1: How many hours a week do you spend playing Diablo?
&#62; A)  0-6
&#62; B)  7-14
&#62; C)  15+
&#62; 
&#62; Question #2: Your real life personality and that of your Diablo 
&#62; persona are
&#62; A)  Incomparable.  I dont have an identifiable persona
&#62; B)  Similar.  My ethical and moral values generally tend to be the 
&#62; same, aside from an occasional pkill J
&#62; C)  Blurred beyond salvation.  I regularly confuse the two.  I catch 
&#62; myself trying to fireball people that drive real slow in the fast 
&#62; lane.
&#62; 
&#62; Question #3: Your favorite character is
&#62; A)  I dont have one, I like and play them all
&#62; B)  I have one class I like the best, but Ive experimented with them 
&#62; all
&#62; C)  I absolutely LOVE that character I created when I first bought 
&#62; the game in January!  Once, I had a hard drive crash and I went into 
&#62; a coma.  My mom had to send the drive off to a data recovery company 
&#62; to wake me from my sleep.
&#62; 
&#62; Question #4:  Describe your typical Battle.Net time.
&#62; A)  I just roam in and out of the public games until I find some cool 
&#62; people to play with
&#62; B)  I roam the public channels and a couple of guild ones.  I chat a 
&#62; bit and play a bit.
&#62; C)  I go to a private guild channel and stay there.  All night.  All 
&#62; day.  Im always there.  Everyone knows me.  I survive on Tic-Tacs 
&#62; and Mountain Dew.
&#62; 
&#62; Question #5:  Are you involved in any Diablo communities?
&#62; A)  Nah, I dont have the time.  Besides, the pubs are fine with me.
&#62; B)  Im in a guild.  Its a cool break from all the cheaters in the 
&#62; public games.  Ive met some cool people that I adventure with semi-
&#62; regularly
&#62; C)  I founded a clan.  You better not say a damn thing about us 
&#62; either.  If you do, well circle the wagons and hire bounty hunters 
&#62; to track you down and bring us your ear.  Thats if we dont get it 
&#62; first.  So just shut up!  Were the best there is and thats that!  No 
&#62; one is gonna defile my clan and get away with it!
&#62; 
&#62; Question #6: Do you read or post on any Diablo related forums?
&#62; A)  I mostly just read.  I post questions on occasion, but for the 
&#62; most part Im a lurker
&#62; B)  I read and post on a semi-regular basis.  I have a nickname that 
&#62; some/most people recognize.
&#62; C)  I read and post every damn day.  In fact, I go through 
&#62; withdrawals if I cant post for more than 3 days at a time.  In a 
&#62; perfect world, I wouldnt have to sleep and I could post my limit 
&#62; 24/7.
&#62; 
&#62; Question #7: How do you feel about cheaters?
&#62; A)  To each his own.  They paid the same for the game as I did.
&#62; B)  Cheaters have ruined the public games for me.  Thats a main 
&#62; reason I joined a guild
&#62; C)  Cheaters are scum!  I hope they all burn in hell!  Die! Die! Die!
&#62; 
&#62; Question #8: What other sorts of games do you like?
&#62; A)  I like the big ones.  You know, Quake, Red Alert, Warcraft 2, etc
&#62; B)  I have a diverse collection.  Some of the big ones and a few of 
&#62; the lesser known titles.  I still play them all
&#62; C)  What the hell kind of question is that?!?  There is no other game 
&#62; that has ever been produced that is as cool as Diablo.  You should go 
&#62; to hell with the cheaters for speaking such heresy!
&#62; 
&#62; Question #9:  What game are you most looking forward to?
&#62; A)  None really, I dont pay attention to games in development, I get 
&#62; most of my games at Christmas and birthdays, so I take what I get.
&#62; B)  Starcraft is looking pretty good.  I thought Id like the 
&#62; Hellfire expansion pack for Diablo, but without multiplayer support, 
&#62; I wont buy it.
&#62; C)  Hellfire and Diablo 2.  End of discussion!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok times up.  Lets see how you did.
&#62; 
&#62; The quiz is pretty straight forward.  The &#34;A&#34; answers are 
&#62; things that a Gamer would say.  This is the type of player that plays 
&#62; casually and only thinks of Diablo as an action game and nothing 
&#62; more.  The &#34;B&#34; answers are the types of things that a Player 
&#62; would say.  This type of individual has explored the role playing 
&#62; aspect of Diablo and found it very satisfying.  The &#34;C&#34; 
&#62; answers are typical of Nerds.  These guys and gals have no real 
&#62; social life.  They eat drink and sleep Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; Scoring.  If you answered in one category only, thats your grade.  
&#62; Your a pure Gamer, Player or Nerd.  If your answers were both As and 
&#62; Bs, your a tweener.  That means that you have the tendencies of 
&#62; both.  If you answered ANY question with a &#34;C&#34;, your a total 
&#62; Nerd and beyond hope.  Get a life.
&#62; 
&#62; :)
&#62; 
&#62; Class dismissed.
