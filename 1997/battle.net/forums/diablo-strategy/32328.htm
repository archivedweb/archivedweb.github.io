&#62; Maybe I will try this missing slot hypothesis a few times. When I was

&#62; I got crap. Maybe having only one slot empty forces it to try to fill 
&#62; that slot, and
&#62; many open slots confuses the game's philanthropy.

Interesting idea.... 
 
&#62; I understand the sentiments of the hogwash post. This version of Lok 
&#62; has found
&#62; about 12 uniques, 2 royal circlets, 2 thinking caps, 2 immoluators, a 
&#62; demonspike
&#62; coat, and a mindcry and some others. The old Lok found lots of 
&#62; eaglehorns and
&#62; Messerschmidts reavers. My other sorcerer seems to find loads of 
&#62; windforces. 

Yes, as said in my disclaimer, it may *NOT* work for other chars... 
it does for me though. I am envyous of your Sorcerer.... todate, I 
have only found 4 or so windforces TOTAL. Tonz of Eaglehorns ZILLIONS 
of &#34;fleshstingers&#34; (I find so many of these it is PATHETIC, 
same with DemonSpike). On a bright note, I found a unique staff I 
have never seen before this morning,,, &#34;immoluator&#34;. First 
one ever! I only have a few uniques left to find before I have found 
them all.... Gryphon's Claw is one...
 
&#62; I think what is going on here is that the random number generator for 
&#62; the drop
&#62; is being seeded by your characters name and perhaps time. So if you 
&#62; play the 
&#62; same character over and over every night at the same time you have a 
&#62; good
&#62; chance of getting the same seed. This is the only explanation which 
&#62; jives with
&#62; what Bliz claims about seeding and repeat finds of the same uniques. 
&#62; Although
&#62; I think it is more than your name, as I have deleted and restarted 
&#62; under the same 
&#62; name and got different duplicate uniques.

I agree that I believe name has less to do with it. I think EXP has a 
little more to do with it though.... my char gets on &#34;themes&#34; 
that last for maybe a day or two or three even. Right now, she's on a 
&#34;Gore&#34; fest ... Sword of gore, Mace of Gore, Axe of Gore 
Dagger of Gore, Blade of Gore etc.... I can't wait till she swings 
back into a &#34;Obsidian&#34; mood.
 
&#62; I still wonder about when the seeding takes place- at the beginning 
&#62; of the game
&#62; when you enter, or when you enter a level. CM's observation about 
&#62; light radius
&#62; triggering going on what you are wearing when you enter a level makes 
&#62; me 
&#62; think that the seeding happens when you go down to the level the 
&#62; first time. I 
&#62; think I will try a few runs tonight with only armor missing.
&#62;

In single player mode, I found a unique char, saved a game, then 
killed him. I reloaded the game, killed him again, reloaded, killed 
him again.... each time, the same item dropped. I don't know if this 
holds for Multi as you can't (legally anyway) save out the game and 
&#34;re-kill&#34; a creature. 

I believe that at least in multi-player, the level is seeded via 
creatures by the person who enters the level first. I'm gonna take a 
HUGE guess here and guess that each unique creature works 1 of two 
ways. #1), for each player in the game, it has a possible item to 
drop if killed by a player (much like Wirt, Griz and Adria all have 
seperate lists of items for each char in the game). *OR* it just 
randomly generates an item when killed by anyone (I may run this in a 
debugger to see what it does.... if I get time time).

It's all fun to think about though... in the end, it all comes down 
to &#34;randomness&#34; as to what item will be dropped. External 
things like, char attribs, class, char state, items carried, items 
worn can all &#34;effect&#34; the random value (that's how I 
implemented some intensive Ball Catch logic in the Football game I'm 
wrapping up. You get a random number but the ranges of what that 
value mean are determined via states in the game (ie: in situation X, 
there is a 50&#37; chance a ball will be caught or deflected, if not 
deflected, there is a 50/50 chance that the ball will either be 
caught or intercepted so that translates into a 50/25/25 table. If we 
assume the offensiver player has a greater catch &#34;attribute&#34;, 
we slide the table slightly in his favor to say: 50/30/20. 

I do not know what method Bliz uses but it is very obvious that items 
worn by the char and char class and exp determine alot of randomness. 
(where I to implement something ala Diablo, I would randomly choose 
first a &#34;group&#34; the item belongs in, then randomize a sub 
group to determine the item).

Damn.... gotta run, boss is on the prowl hehehehehehe
