<pre>Let me guess, when you got pk'd you ranted and raved at the injustice 
of it all.  Mmmmm, yummy.  People like you that get so frustrated by 
pk'ers is why pk'ers exist.  I've pk'ed and been pk'ed.  It's all 
part of the game, not some personal crisis.  Personally I think it 
adds an exciting element to the game.  I mean, really, what is the 
big loss?  Some gold and an ear?  Big deal!  The other night some 
clown tried to m'kill me, but failed because he was a lamer.  I 
taunted him like crazy until he left the game.  No biggie.  I kept 
playing and co'oped with some good players for the next few hours.  
You just have to know how to handle 'em (and sometimes me ;)

I'm going to take your complaint one step further and throw it back 
in your face.  CHEATERS ARE THE REAL PROBLEM!  Your a joke.  &#34;if 
I didn't get pked I wouldn't have ever stopped being legit.&#34;  
Yeah, thats a good excuse.  The propagation of dupes, something that 
you attribute to, is why Battle.Net is garbage, not pk'ers. 

BTW, I think it's great that you hunt pk'ers.  That's just another 
part of the game.  But, don't fool yourself, by pkilling a pk'er, you 
become one.  Welcome to the party pal...Muahahahahaha.

&#62; the big deal of getting someone's ear.. I admit that I'm a PKK (pk 
&#62; killer), but knowing that if I didn't get pked I wouldn't have ever 
&#62; stopped being legit.  Later on as I was killing pks and hunting them 
&#62; I  encountered a cheating pk.  It's pretty sad when a pk has to 
&#62; cheat...  just to get an ear that does nothing at all.  So here's my 
&#62; Frustation... WhY iN the He** do people pk and if for fun then WhY iN 
&#62; tHe He** do they ChEaT?!?!?!?!?!?!?                                   </pre>
