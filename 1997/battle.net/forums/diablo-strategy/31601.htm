<pre>1.  Cheaters exist.  They always have.  They always will.  It is in 
human nature.  Kenwar, the reason that I do not use posts to flame 
them is that I feel it is a waste of my time.  I respect the fact 
that you have a different opinion.

2.  There are ways to avoid cheaters.  Play in a guild.  Play with 
friends.  This is why Blizzard setup the private game option.  I am 
continually amazed that people post things like &#34;You can't play 
in a public game because of cheaters and PK's.&#34;  It's a public 
game.  You are going to encounter the general public (or at least the 
general public of gamers).  I don't know how many of you who post 
these things have looked out your window recently, but THIS JUST IN:  
Some people in the world are not nice.  Life isn't fair.  Get over 
it.  If you play in a public game, you have to accept the 
consequences of this.  (I could spawn off into a whole line of 
reasoning about how this very failure to accept the consequences of 
one's own actions is a sympton that is corrupting the United States- 
but I'll leave that for another time and place.  Oh, and, yes, I am a 
citizen of the aforementioned country.)

3.  Diablo is only a game.  DarkSniper, your drug analogy is not 
convincing to me because real people die because of drugs.  If my 
rogue gets killed on b.net, this is only a virtual death.  There is a 
line between reality and fantasy.  We put the people who cannot 
distinguish between it into institutions.  (Not suggesting that 
DarkSniper needs to be institutionalized- but perhaps I do.)

Keep it real,

Aahz</pre>
