<pre>that I play multi-player solo because I don't want to waste time 
dealing with cheaters, pks etc. and I haven't taken the time to join 
a guild yet (thinking about it tho).  As a result my level 24 rogue 
still uses a piece of crap bow (and armour) and can't seem to 
find/buy a decent one.  Does this mean I'm forced to join a guild or 
take my chances on b.net to get decent equip?  This seems silly 
especially when I'm finding all kinds of nice swords, maces, axes, 
etc.

Eek!    level 24 legit Rogue

&#62; &#62; have any of you noticed this strange thing: When I play with my 
&#62; &#62; warroior, I find LOTS of books
&#62; &#62; 'n scrolls and those little &#34;libraries&#34;, ones that have a 
&#62; &#62; bookshelf and scrolls. I also don't find any
&#62; &#62; good weapons. And, with my mage, its vice versa. VERY fewe 
&#62; &#62; &#34;libraries&#34;, rarely a book, and some
&#62; &#62; (mostly) crap scrolls. Anyone else noticing/suffering this same 
&#62; &#62; thingy?

&#62; I'm trying to get a Rogue leveled up lately and all she seems to
&#62;  find are Staffs of ____. Couldn't find any bows worth a darn.
&#62; My warrior is always finding cool Books, but  since his magic
&#62;  maxed out at 45, he can't even read half the books anymore.
&#62; 
&#62; Does this sound like a major whine-fest or what? Oh well. 
&#62; Just keep looking and eventually we'll find what we need.
&#62; I think alot of the players here get their stuff from trading
&#62; on the net. Is that true?
