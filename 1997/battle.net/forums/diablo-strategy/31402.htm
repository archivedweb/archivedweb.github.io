&#62; here is my story :
&#62; 
&#62; 	I died in lv 15 , surrounded by about 20 immune all blood star . 
&#62; Actually , reason is due to that I can't drink full mana portion 
&#62; while switching weapon . Hence i loss all stuff + a 20 charges A 
&#62; staff . ok, i restart at town , I down the hell(lv 13) and back to 
&#62; town to see if the witch offer me a A staff . After about 15 mins 
&#62; down and up , the witch offer me a 11 charges A staff . Then I back 
&#62; to lv 15 , killed all the witch by that A staff except only one was 
&#62; still alive , . I see my stuff, and stoned that witch , and using my 
&#62; staff kick that ass . I was so glad at that moment ,and try to turn 
&#62; the music on . Hence i pressd the esc key , but my righthand still 
&#62; clicking on the mouse. Wow, the whole screen turned into black , and 
&#62; i quited the game , $&#37;$^&&#37;&&#37;. What the hell , this really 
&#62; fuck me up . Damn it , i restore the backup of my mage at lv 44 . 
&#62; 	will u guys may consider this as cheat ?

Hi ! I recently had something worse happen.  I got killed on
lvl 14 playing solo on hell difficulty.  I put my backup
equipment on and tried to retreive my good equipment and
I got killed again.  After trying many times to get my stuff
back I finally gave up and lost all my good stuff and backup
stuff.  I dont use the backup since I feel goes against the
theme of the game.  If you can reload a backup of your 
character when you die then you are playing with god mode
on.  You can never really die, you just reload your character.
Some people use the backup to protect against system crashes
which I consider a valid use, but if the ability to reload 
is there, and you die, can you resist the temptation to 
reload and get back that Kings Sword of the Heavens that you
just lost ?  I guess I am against anything that Blizzard didnt
provide with the game.  I was playing with a rogue once who
kept charging into dangerous situations and activating a lot
of monsters.  This was annoying cause I almost kept dying.
I found out later she had the backup program and didnt care
if she died.  This is a perfect example of the backup program
actually affecting game play and I bet it happens all the time.
I recomend rebuilding your equipment, you will get much more
satisfaction from this and you will find equipment just as 
good as the stuff you lost.  I am still rebuilding my 
equipment and am having alot of fun doing it.  Since you are
asking what everyone feels about this I can see you have some
doubts yourself about doing it.  If you have to question it,
it is probably wrong and you will feel better about not doing
it.  I find the game much more exciting when I am actually
risking something if I die.

Good luck !
