&#62; The thing that makes acid unique is the fact that there is no 
&#62; resistance to it. You can get resistance to fire, magic and 
&#62; lightning, but not acid. A group of dogs blasting you with acid balls 
&#62; can overwhelm most characters very quickly. So a good strategy for 
&#62; avoiding the acid is called for here.
&#62; 
&#62; 1) Acid has a limited range and the ones with bosses don't usually 
&#62; approach. So when they are with bosses, use a distance attack from 
&#62; just outside their range. 
&#62; 
&#62; 2) They prefer to use their claws if you are close enough. If your 
&#62; armor class is good enough just close to hand to hand combat with 
&#62; them quickly. If there are too many of them for that, just run around 
&#62; a corner and take them out as they turn the corner.
&#62; 
&#62; 3) Their acid does take some time to get to you, how ever short. If 
&#62; you must deal with them from a distance within their range, shoot 
&#62; then move one space to the side and shoot again. If you keep moving, 
&#62; hopefully their acid will go where you were standing, not where you 
&#62; are now.
&#62; 
&#62; 4) You should be able to run faster than them. If you have already 
&#62; cleared part of the dungeon, running will help thin them out and you 
&#62; might be able to get off some distance attacks from out side their 
&#62; range.

i am a lvl 23 warrior and i find that the easist way to kill these 
guys is to walk up and pass out a beat down, swords work well. also 
use a corner so that theyre friends cant shoot at you while your 
fighting 1. another thing, use shift so that you dont walk in it. it 
will not fall where you are standing.</pre>
