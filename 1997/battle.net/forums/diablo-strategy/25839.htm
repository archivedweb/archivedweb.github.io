&#62; Hey all,
&#62; 
&#62; OK, I have a level 37 sorcerer named Binkley, who recently got his 
&#62; third dot solo, and I must say that I found Hell/Hell to be, how 
&#62; shall I say, not what it is hyped to be.  It really wasn't that bad.  
&#62; A major difference between Hell/Hell and easier difficulty levels are 
&#62; the immune-all Soulburners and Advocates.  I ran into both on my way, 
&#62; and I submit that with good resistances, these guys are hardly that 
&#62; difficult.  The Stone Curse/hack/Golem approach is tedious, but not 
&#62; terribly difficult to employ.  The reason is that with the 700-900 
&#62; mana that a high-level mage will normally have, you can take a lot of 
&#62; punishment while you go about stoning everything.  My approach was 
&#62; basically Stone anything in sight, then blast the non-immune 
&#62; creatures to pieces, then work on the immune-all stuff.  I didn't 
&#62; even use Infravision.  I never got into a situation where survival 
&#62; was an issue.  Now, to save time, I only cleared each level to the 
&#62; stairs, plus Laz, and I only cleared part of level 16 and 
&#62; Telekinesised the last two levers.  But I feel that my tactics would 
&#62; have allowed me to clear every level with little or no serious 
&#62; problems, regardless of seeding.
&#62; 
&#62; Now maybe I just have really great stuff for a mage in his mid-30s.  
&#62; Judge for yourself:
&#62; Awesome Full Plate
&#62; Dreamflange
&#62; Sapphire Helm of Sorcery
&#62; Stormshield
&#62; Ruby Amulet of the Zodiac
&#62; Ring of the Zodiac
&#62; Jade Ring of the Stars
&#62; 
&#62; All legitimately found or purchased from Gris.  I have AC 243 and 
&#62; basically maxed resistances.  I feel I've been pretty lucky in 
&#62; finding stuff, but I think mages with lesser setups could handle 
&#62; Hell/Hell with few problems as well.
&#62; 
&#62; I don't know, maybe I wouldn't call Hell/Hell easy, but it certainly 
&#62; is not difficult, for a mage.  My rogue had a much harder time 
&#62; getting her third dot.  And I could see how warriors would get their 
&#62; ass whipped big time.  What do y'all think?
&#62; 
&#62; Yaz

       If u find hell/hell to easy try putting restrictions on 
yourself. For example my warrior is not allowed to use magic items. U 
could do that or limit yourself by not using ceirtain good spells. 
Hope this helps. 

       Yours most bloodthirstly
