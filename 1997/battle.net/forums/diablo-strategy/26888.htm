&#62; how do i get the broad ax that diablo drops when i kill him

Diablo does not always drop items.  In fact, I don't know if I've 
ever seen him do it.  However, the only thing that you can do, is to 
have some one be in the game, but not in level 16 when you kill 
Diablo.  (of course, this only works in multi games).  Then, after 
that movie is over, go back into the game and go to level 16.  WATCH 
OUT!!!  Even though you killed Diablo, there may be another Diablo 
there waiting for you.  Once, three guys killed Diablo and left the 
game.  After playing for about 10 minutes, and deciding that they 
weren't returing, I went to level 16, to see if anything was left 
behind.  After taking two steps in level 16, Diablo was running after 
me.  I thought this was a bug.  But later, in a different game, two 
other people and I killed Lazarus, and a minute later someone joined 
the game, took our portal, and came down to Lazarus' chamber.  Even 
though the room was empty to the three of us, the fourth person died, 
and swore that she could see Lazarus.  We ressurected her, and she 
ran out of the room, but she came back in the room, and appeared to 
be fighting someone, and we could see her hit points go down 
periodically.  Weird.  She continued to swear that Lazarus was still 
alive to her.  Maybe it's a bug.</pre>
