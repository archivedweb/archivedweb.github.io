<pre>I like playing a wizard a lot in multiplayer.
I can go house on a lot of baddies with my
spells, but sometime, especially in hell,
you get monsters that are immune to something
and resist the other two. Not a good thing
for a wizard to face. That's where the
fighter and rogue come in handy.

Boots, as for you claim about the lack of
use for a fighter at higher level,. I just
think that you're not used to playing with
someone who is a good fighter. Just like
a sucky wizard or rogue will allways be
sniping you from behind, a good fighter
knows when to move and when to stand still.
Nothing beats a fighter to hide behind too,
like when I have to restock the potions in
my belt. A quick teleport behind the fighter(s)
, a quick restock, and back into the action.

Plus, let's not forget about how much
sheer punishment the fighter class can take.
They often end up with the most hit points
and the best AC of a group. So if you do hit
them with the stray arrow or spell, it
probably won't be the end of them.

The way I have learned to work it, especially
in hell, is have the fighter(s) stand slightly
in front of the rest of the group. This is
assuming you are in a large, open room. The
monsters that want to fight hand to hand will
rush the fighter(s). From slightly behind and
to the side, the wizards or rogues should
first take out the baddies with ranged weapon/
spells behind the melee the fighter(s) is engaged
in. Once they are neutralized, move to either
side to flank the mob around the fighter(s)
and help finish the group off. The key is,
have your powerful ranged-attack characters
deal with the ranged-attack monsters, so the
fighter(s) don't have to go chasing them down
to who-knows-where!

I personally like playing with one of each
class in a 3-person multiplayer. But I
think that is just for variety. But for
practicality, I think more than one wizard
would be silly.

I would say for 3-person, one of each class.
For 4-person, 1 fighter, 2 rogues, and 1
wizard would be the way to go. I have been
in games with two or more fighters, and have
rarely liked the way they have turned out.

That's all for now.

BTW: I DO like that tactic where the wizard
just uses stone curse and the rest of the
party finishes them off. However, as a
wizard character, I am hesitant to do that,
because I am not sure if I get any experience
for the kill if I do that (after all I am
not doing any damage...). Call me greedy if
you like, but I wanna go up levels too! If
 anybody knows
how that words, please let me know.</pre>
