<pre>well, this is starting to turn into a 24 hour debate between DS and 
co. vs. Code. 

DS, u need to stop trying to tell the world not to cheat. let them go 
as they please. did u read Lorax's post on the continuum? it was the 
most truthful and logical explanation to cheating and legitamacy. 

If a newbie wishes to cheat,  then who gives a crap! let him cheat. 
hes the one wasting $50 on a good game because he will get bored of 
diablo in a couple of weeks. and then maybe after hes gets bored, 
he'll realize that diablo will be fun again if he doesnt cheat. he 
will then hopefully turn away from cheating for good. a gain for u!

Another thing, why dont u at least respect Code for admiting he 
cheats? Have u ever looked at the view of cheating from Code's point 
of view? teleporting gets u across town faster, big deal (i dont 
really consider this cheating because it does not enhance the 
charater itself, it wont help him succeed in the game).many other 
examles like that. What drove Code to cheat, have u ever wondered 
that? why dont u ask him, then u might understand why he cheats?

Now, dont get me wrong, im not taking sides. i dont like the fact 
that Code does cheat, but at least he admits it. DS is a non cheater, 
i like that too. DS, u got your guild nice and large by now, and i 
commend u on that. it full of legit players, very good. keep it up! 
but dont start trying to change people. let them be they way they 
want to be. u will never change the entire diablo world to legit.

Now, i left my e-mail up there for u to e-mail me if u have comments, 
not to flame me. but, i dont go a &#60;bleep&#62; if u do. 

 i meant not to insult u, but to simply comment on u (a simple 
critique). Find your place in the continuum and stay there (i love 
that post Lorax!).

 just for the record, i only am not legit on one of my charaters, the 
rest r fully legit. Nobody's post convinced me to start fully legit 
charaters, i convinced myself (hint, hint DS). 


And one more thing to those who r going to flame me, dont hate me 
because i have an opinion (whether u agree w/ it or not, all i ask is 
that u respect my opinion)

c-ya yall in channel forum at 8:00 pm est Saturday
