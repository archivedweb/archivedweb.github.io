<pre>Hi Code-Myst,

Perhaps one of the posts was mine?  I wrote several days ago an 
article entitled &#34;Stealth Mode --Roguish Fun&#34;  It may be gone 
by now.  Since I have never seen a Ring of Darkness, my method 
required a little more care, but I knew I could use BlackOak Shield 
and Shadowhawk and get a similiar result --I just wanted the use of 
my bow, instead of spells, which can get the same result, tho.  I 
still like the comfort of armor (just in case), and it is very hard 
for me to part with my Royal Circlet, even tho this method works, it 
is still sometimes fun, when questing with friends, to go in 
&#34;guns blazing.&#34;

You are absolutely right about the entering the level thing affecting 
your light radius for the level  --I found that out the hard way as I 
entered a level with my Circlet on, then changed to Gotterdammerung --
the critters could spot me, but not when I entered with Gotter-d.

The Windforce trick is a good idea.  Here is another that will clear 
out all the members of D's entourage quickly and efficiently (I use 
Eaglehorn for this, btw).  Follow the walls, pausing at each space 
and fire a stream of arrows in a straight line whenever possible 
north, south east and west.  Don't wait to hear a hit --just fire 
until you are positive nothing is there or you hit something and it 
dies.  If no hits, move to the next space and fire again.  Repeat 
this process.  I had to lead D away from his lair to take out his 
cronies, but none of them were ever able to close on me before they 
perished.  Edge along the wall all the way around the room.  You can 
do this with other big, open, rooms in Hell too.  Sure, this is slow, 
but it is fun --real hunting, Rogue-style.  As I mentioned in my 
previous post --this isn't easy to do when with other players as 
their light aura will tip critters off to your presence.  Also, a 
warning --using Gotter-d (no resistances) with Sorcerors present --
well, be very very careful.
