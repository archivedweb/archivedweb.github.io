<pre>Well,

When i got on battle.net, i did my usual search for people that i 
might play a co-op game with, and what my luck, no one was on.  So I 
go to the Games List and visit a few, not finding much action going 
on.  So i see an advertisement for a game, and when the advertiser 
leaves I said, &#34;What the He77&#34; and joined.

Ahhhh...to my dismay, i'm placed w/ around a level 15 warrior, a 
Level 1 rogue, and the creator (but he soon dropped to ping timeout) 
but he did leave the level 1 rogue, some nice parting gifts.  Godly 
Plate of Whale.  I decided to go to hell, since they couldn't go 
down, and i could have a chance to look for rings and other stuff.  
The peace and serenity of killing Blood Knights lasted about 5 
minutes, until i hear the plainting cries of the rogue, asking for a 
portal so he can get experience.  I replied, &#34;Go to Dungeons&#34; 
at least 5 times, but no luck.  Again I think, &#34;I'm not going to 
look after him and i'll go on my way.&#34;  But as i fire up a 
portal, he/she (not for sure) leaves and comes back about 5 minutes 
later with his/her brother whom was a level 22 Rogue.  So sooner than 
i could get something to drink, they were all down there.  :(  (so 
much for serenity)  and you would figure that the level 1 rogue, 
would be dead and gone before you know it, but it didn't happen that 
way.  The level 15 warrior died 3 times.  The level 1 rogue, was 
cheating using zodiac rings and the gpow (from the creator) so when 
he/she would be plummeted by attacks they would gain levels, and be 
replenished.  The Rogue finally got to Level 7 as we went to face 
lazarus, and I had been presumed the leader, I easily took care of 
lazarus (stone curse) and we decided not to finish level 15 but to go 
down to 16, and then i was dis-connected from ping timeout (i guess)  
I didn't bother to re-connect, i just closed diablo, and opened up 
nutscrape.

And besides not having my serenity, the rings/amulets i found were 
crap.  I found two ring of wizardy (one was +24 to magic and the 
other was +27 to magic) and a ring of stars.  :( I have found better 
rings than those.  I just always get a tingle up my spine when the 
*ting* of a ring/amulet is heard, and i hope it's a Zodiac Ring.  I 
did find a Jade Ring of Zodiac once, and i still use it.  

But one good thing did happen, i Got a GGGRRREEEEAATTTT bow to use as 
my backup.  A Savage bow of Lighting, that i bought from Gris.  Found 
two helms in hell, but they weren't all that grand.  My Helm of 
Mammoth suits me JUST fine.  :)

Gosh..I wrote a lot about having a bad night on b.net.
