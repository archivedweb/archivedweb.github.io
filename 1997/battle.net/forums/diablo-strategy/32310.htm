<pre>Good post Aahzmadius. Please do more of them.

What tactics I use are determined by what type and level of players I 
am with. My guild is fairly large and I could end up with a different 
mix of players each night. If my Mage is the highest level character, 
I usually stone the monsters and let the others get the experience. 
If I am the lowest level, I would like a lions share of the 
experience. If we are all about the same level, it's a mix.

When to stone?
If I am helping out a Warrior who is being attacked by knights, I try 
to figure out how many he can handle on this own (1,2,3) and only 
start stoning when he is surrounded my more than that. If I stone 
them all, he's just killing rocks, and that's no fun. 
If I am helping out a Rogue who is being approached by one knight, I 
let her pin it with arrows, while keeping everything else off her 
back.
If I am with a Warrior who is a higher level than my Mage and we are 
taking on a group of witches, I always stone one to give him 
something to do while I take out the rest with Fireball.

If you are trying to keep the experience even in a group of 
characters at about the same level, you can have the Mage scout with 
Elemental or Guardian and pick up some safe experience that way. Just 
before going into the room and stoning things, send in you Golem and 
let it kill some with them. You should also be able to find at least 
some monsters well away from the other players to Fireball.

If you want to use Chain in a group, you should first have a good 
understanding of how it targets monsters. If you don't know this yet, 
DON'T use Chain in a group until you do. When you do understand it, 
don't use Chain if the others can be hit by stray bolts. You might 
want to set one of your hotkeys to something like:
&#34; BACTRACK past the last choke point so I can use CHAIN safely 
&#34;
Then start walking in the direction you want them to go. After you 
stop and the other players have passed you, then Chain the monsters 
who followed and are lined up nicely to get hit by all the bolts. 
This works best if you explain it to the others and they grasp the 
strategic advantage before going down in the dungeon.
