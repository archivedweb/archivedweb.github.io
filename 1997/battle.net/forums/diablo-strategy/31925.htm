<blockquote>
<pre>I am running out the door to a meeting, so I only have time to jot 
down a few quick thoughts before this thread disappears on page 2.

First, I think that some of the more difficult issues about low level 
characters being helped by higher level characters, etc., probably 
are artifacts of the way the game was created.  As I understand it, 
Diablo was initially conceived as a single player game and 
multiplayer features were added later, almost as an afterthought.  In 
solo play, the character can't get items from someone else, can't 
have someone else buy elixirs or other items for them, can't use 
someone else's portal to shortcut to Hell, etc.  These only become 
possible (and difficult issues) due to the multiplayer feature.  
These issues may well have resolved as part of the game design if 
Diablo had started out with multiplayer play as a possibility.  

Second, I agree with you, CM, that many of these actions make the 
game less challenging, lessen risk, appear to be contrary to 
&#34;role playing&#34; the game, etc.  But I can't call it 
&#34;cheating.&#34;  When we run into real problems with applying our 
definition of cheating, we need to re-examine basic assumptions, such 
as our definition of cheating. Or if our definition of cheating seems 
to be workable, perhaps what we really need is a new term or word to 
describe this type of action (e.g., &#34;unsporting&#34;)?

Third, with regard to the use of backup programs, Thecla, do you see 
any problem with backing up the character information files as 
instructed by Blizzard?  If not, how is that different from a program 
like Kevin's that is run while Diablo is not running?  Both use 
&#34;external&#34; programs: Kevin's program and the DOS/Windows 
operating system or equivalent (you use the operating system when you 
type the &#34;copy&#34; command).  The internal/external program may 
seem like a clean line to draw, but it really isn't, as evidenced by 
bugs (internal) and Blizzard's sanctioning of copying the character 
files.

While it's a tough call, since Blizzard appears to have no problem 
with people copying their data files for certain purposes, I can't 
call this cheating.  By analogy to my old roleplaying days with AD&D, 
all my character &#34;data&#34; is stored on a sheet of paper.  If I 
lost that paper, or it was destroyed or rendered illegible for some 
reason, would I be cheating to fill out a new character data sheet 
for the next session. Or, if I were foresightful enough, use a copy 
of the character data sheet?

I do not view the Diablo character data files as my character any 
more than I viewed my data sheet as my AD&D character.  My character 
is a fusion of that data, the game design, and your imagination (and 
the imagination of the other players).  Can someone who clones my 
character data really be said to be playing my character, even though 
all the character data is identical?  No.  

Hmmm . . . I didn't mean to get so philosophical.  Must be the time 
of day!

&#62; Since I have additional comments and questions for you both, based on 
&#62; the cheating survey results, I decided to start a new thread. (BTW, 
&#62; CM, did you notice that your survey was re-posted in Ogden's with 
&#62; several replies? You may want to update your results.)
&#62; 
&#62; CM, I admire the fact that you were willing to change your answer to
&#62; #10, both because of the fact that you are willing to change your mind
&#62; and because you are being consistent with your prior analysis.  
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with you, Lok, the fundamental question is how you define 
&#62; cheating.  You and I seem to have the same definition.  Compare the 
&#62; definition in your discussion:
&#62; 
&#62;    It appears that everyone has their own view on cheating. Many 
&#62;    people do not have a consistant view on cheating. Anyone can 
&#62;    create a whole big long laundry list of 'easy' tactics which 
&#62;    some might frown upon and call cheating. By defining cheating 
&#62;    in this subjective manner, you are heading for an inconsistant 
&#62;    view on cheating.
&#62; 
&#62;    The only objective view of cheating is that any 3rd party 
&#62;    program is cheating. Abuse of bugs is a gray area, but in 
&#62;    general I would lump abuse of bugs in with cheating since bugs 
&#62;    were not intended to be in the game. Anything else is legit play.
&#62; 
&#62; with my definition of cheating given in my reply to CM (and earlier 
&#62; posts) (although I do not think the use of internal anomalies or bugs 
&#62; not intended to be in the game is a gray area; I consider it to be
&#62; cheating).  And I think, CM, that this is probably fairly close to 
&#62; your definition as well.
&#62; 
&#62; I do not include the phrase &#34;to gain an (unfair) advantage&#34; 
&#62; in my
&#62; definition of cheating because this incorporates intent in the 
&#62; definition, which I prefer not to do.  First, I want to keep the 
&#62; definition as objective as possible, and leave the subjective value
&#62; judgments for later (e.g., is the cheating harmful, justified, etc.?).
&#62; Second, incorporating intent/advantage into the definition seems to 
&#62; encourage inconsistency.  I believe that the identical pattern
&#62; of behavior should be considered a cheat regardless of what the 
&#62; intent was.  Third, is raises the question of what can be considered 
&#62; an 
&#62; advantage?  Is is an unfair advantage to duel when one person has a 
&#62; much faster computer or connection than another?  Perhaps, but it is
&#62; not cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, let's get to specific cases:
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Shopping&#34;  -  CM, your points are well taken in that 
&#62; &#34;shopping&#34; may reduce the challenge of the game, but I think 
&#62; that this incorporates 
&#62; the &#34;intent/advantage&#34; element that I leave out of my 
&#62; definition. There are many things that give someone an advantage, 
&#62; fair or unfair,
&#62; but as long as it is part of the game design and does not take 
&#62; advantage of a bug, it should not be considered cheating.  I believe
&#62; Lok discussed the difference between actions that are cheats and 
&#62; actions that reduce the challenge of the game (e.g., accepting items
&#62; from a higher level character) in a previous post.
&#62; 
&#62; I noticed that you brought up the idea of playing the game.  To me,
&#62; someone creates or plays the &#34;game&#34; when they create the game 
&#62; and 
&#62; appear in town.  To me, wandering through town and selling or buying
&#62; items is &#34;playing&#34; the game.  Defining it otherwise leads to 
&#62; tough
&#62; questions about when playing the game actually begins.  For example, 
&#62; CM, do you consider it cheating for someone to portal up and down 
&#62; repeatedly from the dungeon to cause Adria to get a new supply of
&#62; elixirs, books and staves?  Does it matter if that person does nothing
&#62; on the dungeon side except cast a new town portal and reenter it, or
&#62; do they have to kill something?  (BTW, some people seem to define the 
&#62; &#34;game&#34; more broadly than either of us to include the entirety 
&#62; of b.net and sometimes even this forum. This came up in the PK 
&#62; debates a few weeks ago.)
&#62; 
&#62; I also noticed that you distinguished between the Laz runs and 
&#62; shopping by the fact that Blizzard created a shortcut to get to Hell. 
&#62; First, this doesn't answer my question with regard to continuing on to
&#62; Level 16, since the same shortcut that leads to Laz leads to Level 
&#62; 16. The difficulty in deciding where cheating begins and ends in this 
&#62; question is why I define cheating the way I do.  Second, isn't this 
&#62; somewhat inconsistent with our analysis of a lower level character 
&#62; porting to Hell?  Arguably, Blizzard didn't want that
&#62; character to use the Hell shortcut until he/she reached Level 13 
&#62; through the preceding 12 levels.  And third, Blizzard gave us the 
&#62; ability to start a new game at any time.  If it had wanted us to 
&#62; &#34;play&#34; the game before restarting, they simply could have 
&#62; removed that option until a dungeon had been entered, etc. (i.e., 
&#62; whenever the &#34;game&#34; had been &#34;played&#34; sufficiently).
&#62; 
&#62; Lok, I like your analysis of balancing the &#34;shopping&#34; aspect 
&#62; with the difficulty of the &#34;walks&#34; to Wirt and Adria.  While 
&#62; I still feel it would not be cheating even if all the &#34;shops&#34; 
&#62; were close together, this indicates to me that Blizzard took 
&#62; &#34;shopping&#34; into consideration as something people would do 
&#62; within the game.
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Elixirs&#34;  - CM, you noted that you were leaning towards 
&#62; calling this a cheat because Blizzard had indicated that they did not 
&#62; want lower level characters to use them by limiting their ability to 
&#62; purchase them.  But isn't this also inconsistent with our analysis of 
&#62; a lower level character to Hell?  As discussed above, Blizzard seems 
&#62; to have indicated that lower level characters should not have a 
&#62; shortcut to Hell unless they went through the preceding levels.  
&#62; Blizzard could have stopped lower level characters from using the 
&#62; portal method to enter Hell, and similarly could have made elixirs 
&#62; ineffective for characters below Level 26.  
&#62; 
&#62; This also appears inconsistent with our analysis of &#34;middle-
&#62; man&#34; buying.  Blizzard seems to have indicated that lower level 
&#62; characters should not have the option of buying high level items by 
&#62; limiting their direct buying options.  But we agree that &#34;middle-
&#62; man&#34; buying is not a cheat.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;MKing&#34; - Since we're discussing Blizzard's intentions, I 
&#62; have a new question to toss in the mix.  Blizzard appears to have 
&#62; desired to limit the &#34;rewards&#34; of PKing to some gold and an 
&#62; ear.  In beta, the victim also lost their equipped items, but this 
&#62; feature was removed for the commercial release.  MKing, of course, is 
&#62; the use of monsters and spells to cause the victim to lose their 
&#62; equipped items, and appears to be contrary to Blizzard's intent to 
&#62; limit the rewards of PKing.  Is this a game anomaly/bug that should 
&#62; be considered cheating?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Looking forward to your thoughts. . . 
&#62; 
&#62; Zamp 
&#62; Snakegod
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  CM, you have now twice mentioned a new bug that allows the use 
&#62; of certain spells in town.  What spells can be cast?  Does it require 
&#62; the use of any external programs?  What should I watch out for? Can 
&#62; it lead to a new era of TownKill?  (If, like me, you would hate to 
&#62; see a new cheat of this sort get widely known and/or abused, please 
&#62; feel free to email me at the above address.)</pre>
