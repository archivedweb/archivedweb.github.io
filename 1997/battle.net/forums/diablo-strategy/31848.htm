<pre>I don't think it's silly at all.  As an old-time AD&D player, I too 
have been thinking for the last couple of months (since the PK 
debates) how the AD&D alignment system seems to fit the b.net 
environment (in a rough way). I also label the major axes as you do:  
Coop - PK  (corresponding to the Good-Evil axis) and Legit - Cheat 
(corresponding to the Law-Chaos axis).  Each axis is a continuum (as 
Lorax posted about the Legit-Cheat axis a few pages back), and each 
person (and perhaps clans) can be placed on the 2-dimensional plane 
according to their beliefs and actions.

Note that because each axis is a continuum, not all people who use 
&#34;cheats&#34; of one sort or another can be considered chaotic, 
etc.  For example, you classify Code Myster as a Chaotic Good.  Your 
Chaotic Good, however, includes all people who use cheats more than 
CM but do not PK (e.g., dupers, godmoders, hacked items, etc.).  I do 
not know exactly what cheats CM uses, but in recent posts he has 
admitted to cheating by (1) using backup programs, (2) teleporting in 
town, (3) using Deye, and (4) restarting games to go 
&#34;shopping&#34;.  Number 4 should not be considered cheating (as I 
define it), Number 3 may or may not be cheating (opinion seems to be 
split), Number 2 is cheating, and Number 1 may or may not be 
cheating, depending on its use (again, opinion seems to be split).  
Since CM appears to use 1 and 3 to not gain an unfair advantage 
contrary to the spirit of the game (e.g., backing up after losing 
equipment to monsters), and since teleporting in town is relatively 
innocuous (I really can't see the 20 or so seconds saved as a 
significant advantage or disadvantage;  having a faster computer 
creates a much greater advantage in load times, etc.), I probably 
would place CM high on the &#34;Co-op&#34; end of that axis and 
towards the middle of the other.  In other words, Neutral Good. 

It's an interesting thought-experiment (and I'm glad to see a fellow 
Snake also has played AD&D . . . I'm willing to bet that most of us 
have).

See you around the Inferno Refugee Camp (aka the &#34;Snakegod&#34; 
channel) sometime!

&#62;    OK, I missed the last couple of days on the forum while getting my 
&#62; car repaired, so I didn't have much chance to be in on the big 
&#62; debates. So, with apologies to Kramer and Lorax, I'd like to toss in 
&#62; my 2$'s worth. (Inflation, y'know?)
&#62; 
&#62;   This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now, and 
&#62; I've gotta get it out. Lots of people seem to think only in terms of 
&#62; Good/Bad, Legit/Cheat, Co-op/PK. Each duality is considered the same 
&#62; (ie Good=Legit=Co-op; Bad=Cheat=PK), but I think we really need to 
&#62; think along two axis instead of one. I once played a great deal of 
&#62; AD&D, and Diablo has a lot of similarities to the old tabletop 
&#62; classic. So, what I'm considering here is a WHOLE NEW idea: using the 
&#62; AD&D alignment system to kill two birds with one stone: (1) quickly 
&#62; divide people up into those you do(n't) want to play with, and (2) 
&#62; make cheating part of the roleplaying experience available to Diablo 
&#62; players. First off, Legit/Cheat isn't about good and evil, it's about 
&#62; following the rules. Thus, Lawful and Chaotic are the new terms of 
&#62; the day. Co-op/PK can be described as good and evil, though. Either 
&#62; you work with people, or you prey upon them. Even this isn't iron-
&#62; clad, however; remember duelling, self-defense, and avenging honor 
&#62; are &#34;good&#34; reasons for player killing.
&#62; 
&#62; Some examples, which may be construed as &#34;picking on&#34; if you 
&#62; wish, although such is not my intent.
&#62; 
&#62;    Lawful Good: DarkSniper, obviously. Also, however remember that 
&#62; less verbose posters also qualify as LG, just because you don't 
&#62; preach a sermon, doesn't mean you can't keep the faith.
&#62;    Lawful Neutral: I've yet to see this creature. Stays away from 
&#62; cheats, but has no compunctions against wasting a fellow player, 
&#62; especially if they are annoying in some manner. May attack from 
&#62; suprise, but probably won't.
&#62;    Lawful Evil: The image projected by the Priests of Chaos guild. 
&#62; They don't cheat, but they'll use every trick in the book to kill 
&#62; other players. I can respect that. (Not that I'd knowingly play in a 
&#62; game with one.)
&#62;    Neutral Good: These are the newbie-helpers. They dupe things, or 
&#62; hand out unneeded items to new players. Or, perhaps, like myself, 
&#62; maintain back-ups in case of crashing.
&#62;    True Neutral: Haven't seen this person yet either. Probably just 
&#62; not interested in anything beyond single player, though.
&#62;    Neutral Evil: These are the people who like killing other players, 
&#62; and are just to that stage where it would be a little easier if they 
&#62; could dupe off that ring they found, or use Deye to pick easy 
&#62; targets. They stack the deck, but don't use marked cards . . . . yet.
&#62;    Chaotic Good: Code Myster. He uses the cheats, he admits to it, 
&#62; and isn't ashamed of it. But, he doesn't hurt other players, so good 
&#62; for him.
&#62;    Chaotic Neutral: This guy doesn't play Diablo, he plays SNES games 
&#62; with a game genie. He wants every advantage possible, and doesn't 
&#62; care to bother with other players either way.
&#62;    Chaotic Evil: The scum of battlenet. Godmode PKers. TownKillers. 
&#62; These are the people who use Raymond's Trainer to cripple your 
&#62; character, then copy all your items, then let you get monster killed 
&#62; in Laz's chamber. STAY AWAY!
&#62; 
&#62;    Some of you probably think this post is a little silly, and I 
&#62; agree, it is a little silly. But then, having a huge, hostile fight 
&#62; over a computer game is a little silly as well. Thanks for reading 
&#62; this far.
