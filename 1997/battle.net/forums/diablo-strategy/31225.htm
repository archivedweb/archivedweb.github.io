<pre>first thing i d like to apologize to all who has supported me, and 
now thinks im wrong in this case. but this is me i dont go around the 
bushes. 

to lorax...

lorax, lorax, lorax. when will u get my point? ok i get ur point 
already. if u read my reply, i do admit i was rude. ur point is that 
im rude rite? if not put ur point in where it saids subject. and my 
point is, if he gets this clan going, he ll have a great chance that 
the clan will screw up. now this desn't effect me. but think about 
all the little members in his clan? how would they feel? im telling 
him to quit cos i dont want him to create a clan thats full of 
cheaters (cos he cant even determine which one is cheater), therefore 
increasing the number of cheaters in the clan. if u read my post, u 
know i hate cheaters and im sure u do too. now my philosiphy is to 
stop cheating as much as possible. and to stop it, we should tell 
beginners about it before the cheats ruin the game for them. now 
would u agree with me?

to Str8tohell...

now dreamflange is a mace, not a ring. the ring is a hacked item and 
this guy doesn't even know about it. now i have nothing against 
people who doesn't know about this. but dont start a clan if u dont 
know jac, and if u wanna start a clan, i ll say the same thing to u 
as well. dont get me wrong, i have all the respect for u, as i once 
knew nothing about this ring and mace thing. but until u know more 
about the game, i dont think u should start a clan. now thats my 
point.

to Mana Flux(BP)

this is the fun one. i did get offended when u said u have to strip 
search us, as that shows ur doublt in my leadership ability. why not 
the other way around? let us strip search ur clan? why only us? i 
think this should be a both way thing. and why do i have to close 
down my clan? this is the funny one. why should i merge with ur clan? 
and not ur clan merge with mine? i said i would gladly give up my 
leader position to a person with good leadership skills. how would i 
know ur leader? btw, how could u agree with a leader that does do 
much?

by all means, i have nothing against ur clan, i respect ur clan, and 
i think u should respect mine.
