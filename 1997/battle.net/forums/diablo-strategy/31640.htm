&#62; My level 24 Warrior enter level 12 normal/caves and after slowly 
&#62; turning a corner was assaulted by about 10 - 15 of the Bloodstar 
&#62; Hurling Bitches (I don't remember their real names - I didn't have 
&#62; that much free time). Only my outstanding footspeed and stair 
&#62; climbing ability got me out of that one.

Cool, I thought I was the only one who refered to them by the name 
&#34;bitches&#34; in general.  Rarely do I ever use their real 
name(s).

&#62; Does magic resistance help against bloodstars? I was 74&#37; 
&#62; lightning and MAX fire but only 12&#37; magic resistance. My 
&#62; dexterity was up to 88 (59 + 29 from items) and I'm not sure my 
&#62; shield blocked any of them.

Yes, bloodstar is magic.  For you, it's useless so far as I can tell 
(as a warrior anyway).  For them... (doesn't it seem a little jilted?)
At any rate, max resist magic will GREATLY improve your lifespan vs. 
these.  Your sheild can but RARELY will ever block a magic attack.  
At least mine isn't good at it, and my dex is like 120something or 
more, plus stormsheild with fastblock. 

&#62; Any insight would be appreciated.

The key here is FIREBALL.  At least in normal, and to some extent 
nightmare (though I've only been there twice).  All but one of them 
is vulnerable to fireball, the EXCEPT being soul burners (yellow and 
blue bitches : )  They require lightning.  With fireball and all the 
others, you target the one in the middle, the explosion usually kills 
all the ones around her in a single hit.  (of course your fireball 
has to be fairly decent).  With the yellow, you get them into a big 
huddling group in front of you then CL (chain lightning) away.  This 
sucks down mana fast, but is faster than tracking them down one at a 
time with a sword.</pre>
