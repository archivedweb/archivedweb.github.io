<pre>Another case to consider.

On Wednesday, June 11th, you buy a tape drive for your computer.  On 
Thursday, June 12th, you make a COMPLETE copy of your C: drive.  On 
Friday, June 13th (Friday 13th), you download a virus and it 
completely wipes out your C: drive.  On Saturday, you get rid of the 
virus and copy your C: drive contents from your tape drive to your C: 
drive.  On Sunday, you decide to play Diablo.  BUT WAIT!!!  The 
character you're now going to play is a backup because the virus ate 
the original.  Do you 1. delete your characters or 2. play on.

I haven't tried backing up my character, but it seems that 2 would be 
the logical choice.  Afterall, if you backup your english paper and 
have to use the backup, do you admit to your professor of CHEATING?  
Of course not.

1. You did not copy someone else's work, it was your own
   [copying someone's else's character].

2. It is not a graded paper that you are trying to improve upon
   [restoring your character after a disasterous fight in hell].

No reason to contact the chancellor!!!  In fact, 9 out of 10 
chancellors and 8 out of 10 deans recommend backing up your work.  
The rest are computer dinos.

&#62; If you're not TOO tired of this discussion, let's continue . . .
&#62; 
&#62; I read your last post (which is now somewhere near the bottom of this 
&#62; page), and, like you, have been giving this some thought.  As I 
&#62; understand it, you consider backing up the data files using a third 
&#62; party program or DOS (even following Blizzard's instructions) to be 
&#62; &#34;cheating.&#34;  Based on an earlier post, however, you do not 
&#62; consider backing up your entire hard drive, character data included, 
&#62; to be cheating.  I see these views as inconsistent and want to 
&#62; explore any differences you see.
&#62; 
&#62; I want to start out by making two things clear.  First, we are not 
&#62; talking about a multiplayer &#34;save&#34; function like the one that 
&#62; exists in single player mode.  Diablo already does this automatically 
&#62; for you in multiplayer.  And I agree, and I think most everyone else 
&#62; does as well, that restoring a backed-up character file to avoid 
&#62; adverse consequences that occurred during game play (e.g., loss of 
&#62; items to monsters) is cheating (even though it can be done in single 
&#62; player mode).
&#62; 
&#62; Second, there is a difference between &#34;backing up&#34; the 
&#62; character data files by copying them to a new location or disk, and 
&#62; &#34;restoring&#34; that character data file by copying it back  
&#62; (Aahz and I, in fact, have just exchanged emails on this issue).  The 
&#62; mere act of backing up, as long as the act of restoration does not 
&#62; occur, cannot in my opinion be called cheating.  It by itself has no 
&#62; effect on your character or your game.  It may make you play more 
&#62; carelessly because you know you can always regain your equipment, but 
&#62; that use clearly is cheating and my assumption will be that the 
&#62; backup was not done for that purpose.  (Of course, the temptation to 
&#62; cheat by using it in this manner may be there, but I will assume that 
&#62; the user has the moral fortitude to resist that temptation, just as 
&#62; he or she already has resisted the temptation to dupe, etc.)  (In 
&#62; case you're wondering, I do back up my character data files, but I 
&#62; have not yet had cause to restore them.)
&#62; 
&#62; Thus, I see no difference between copying the specific data files by 
&#62; DOS or by Kevin's program and copying these files as part of a larger 
&#62; group (up to and including the entire hard disk).  In each case, the 
&#62; data is being transferred by a third-party program to another, 
&#62; presumably safer, location.
&#62; 
&#62; To use another analogy, when playing other CRPGs I often copied the 
&#62; save game files to a floppy disk in case something happened to 
&#62; corrupt those save game files or if my hard drive crashed.  If I 
&#62; tried to retrieve one of those saved games within the game and 
&#62; discovered the saved game was corrupted, was it cheating for me to 
&#62; copy my back-up file back into the saved game directory?  I don't 
&#62; think so.
&#62; 
&#62; If the restoration of the Diablo back-up files is done for similar 
&#62; reasons, then I see no difference.  What really matters is how and 
&#62; why the restoration is done.
&#62; 
&#62; Let me enlarge on my AD&D character data sheet analogy a little bit 
&#62; with respect to the metagame concept of roleplaying a character.  
&#62; When I am roleplaying my character during a game, whatever happens to 
&#62; my character happens and can only be reversed or corrected from 
&#62; &#34;within&#34; the game (my character has &#34;continuity&#34; or 
&#62; &#34;history&#34;).  If my sword breaks or gets lost, I have to 
&#62; repair it or find a new one.  In my AD&D game, the sword gets marked 
&#62; off my character data sheet.  If that data sheet was lost, it would 
&#62; be cheating if I recreated it and gave myself that sword back (or if 
&#62; I used an older copy that still had the sword on it).  It is not 
&#62; cheating if my new sheet is exactly the same as the one that was lost 
&#62;  (in fact, using backup files on a computer avoids human memory 
&#62; lapses, and thus is less likely to result in variations in the 
&#62; character data restored).
&#62; 
&#62; The key in each game is to focus not on the data file or sheet, but 
&#62; on the continuity of the character.  The character, and his or her 
&#62; history, should NOT be affected by events or actions outside the 
&#62; game, whether it be hacking the data file to increase stats, or 
&#62; corruption or loss of the data file itself.
&#62; 
&#62; Let me pose an interesting hypothetical for Diablo:  you back up your 
&#62; character one day, play the next day and lose all your equipment.  
&#62; Not wanting to be a cheater, on the third day (after recovering from 
&#62; your depression!) you go treasure hunting to replace your equipment.  
&#62; For some reason (your character data file is corrupted, the machine's 
&#62; &#34;name&#34; changes, etc.), you can't start a Diablo game with 
&#62; your character!  You back up the character data file, which works, 
&#62; but upon starting you find that you still have all of the equipment 
&#62; you lost because the backup occurred one day before the game where 
&#62; you lost it all.  Is it cheating to keep the equipment?  I think so, 
&#62; based on my analysis above.  What should you do?  Toss all the 
&#62; equipment that you lost (goodbye ObZod Ring, goodbye Awesome Plate . 
&#62; . :(  ).  Why? To restore character continuity as closely as possible.
&#62; 
&#62; BTW, I recently saw a post on this issue in which someone said they 
&#62; viewed the hard disk crash, file corruption, etc. as part of the 
&#62; history of their character.  I think this breaches the boundary 
&#62; between the RPG and RL, and is not proper roleplaying (but, then, I 
&#62; am a roleplaying purist at heart).  (Despite the fact that I sign 
&#62; these posts with my character's name, these posts are not part of my 
&#62; character's &#34;history.&#34;)
&#62; 
&#62; Once again this is longer than intended.  Sorry . . .
