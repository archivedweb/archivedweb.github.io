&#62; Very interesting survey and discussion in all the posts (I didn't 
&#62; read 
&#62; them before posting but I did read them afterwards).  And thanks 
&#62; for summarizing the results.

Thanks! (I hope this hope this post won't be too messy to read).


&#62; 
&#62; And now, a couple of comments on your own answers . . . 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #2). &#34;accept Items&#34;
&#62; &#62; This is not cheating as long as the item is legit. It may ruin the 
&#62; &#62; players fun though.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #3). &#34;higher level chars buy items&#34;
&#62; &#62; This is a grey area. You cannot access something so you are having 
&#62; &#62; others access it for you. To this I would have to say, No, not 
&#62; &#62; cheating.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #4). &#34;elixers?&#34;
&#62; &#62; This is again like #3, a grey area. I cringe to give elixers to 
&#62; &#62; people below level 26 as blizz did not intend for them to get them at 
&#62; &#62; that level... I lean towards a YES here.
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with you on 2 and 3, but while I agree that giving elixers to
&#62; low level players may be a bad idea, it is not cheating.  How is it
&#62; different from 2 or 3 except in the nature of the item being given?
&#62; And borrowing your portal argument below, if Blizzard did not want
&#62; low level characters to benefit from elixirs, it simply could have 
&#62; made them ineffective (this appears to be an artifact of the 
&#62; development of the game as a single player game, where a player
&#62; would not be able to get elixirs from any other source than
&#62; Adria, who would not sell them until level 26).  
&#62; 
&#62; Please explain the difference between 2, 3, and 4, and how 4 fits
&#62; within your definition of cheating but 2 and 3 do not.


Ok, here is how I see this. You are right that #2,#3 and #4 are 
closely related. I feel 4 differs slightly though because there *IS* 
a current restriction on lower level players. It seems to me that at 
least Blizz made an effort to limit this somehow.... I know this may 
sound a little weak for an explaination but that's my justification. 
As for all my cheating definitions, this is the one I'm most weak on. 

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #5). &#34;clear levels&#34;
&#62; &#62; Not cheating.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #6). &#34;shopping&#34;
&#62; &#62; Absolutely is cheating. I think this is bending the rules of Diablo 
&#62; &#62; to restart hundreds of games in order to &#34;ramdomly&#34; get an 
&#62; &#62; item you wish. What is the difference between this and restarting 
&#62; &#62; games until you get one with &#34;easier&#34; creatures to get your 
&#62; &#62; exp? It is cheating (and I'm guiltly of it)
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with you on 5, but not on 6.  To answer your hypothetical, 
&#62; there is no difference between restarting games to get easier 
&#62; creatures and restarting to get different items.  Neither is cheating 
&#62; (as I reasoned in my reply to your survey, starting a new game is a
&#62; part of the game design, and your intent in restarting is irrelevant).
&#62; Again, please explain how this fits within your definition of 
&#62; cheating. 
&#62; In particular, please answer the hypothetical questions I asked in
&#62; my reply, such as when can you restart without it being cheating? 
&#62; Do you have to clear all 16 levels?  Is is cheating to start a game
&#62; to do a Laz run (i.e., ignoring all but levels 13-15)?  Is is cheating
&#62; for a low level character to complete the lower levels of the 
&#62; dungeons (i.e., church and cats) without completing or attempting
&#62; to complete the more difficult levels? 

OOOooooooooo These are difficult questions. You are asking me 
&#34;what constitutes a game&#34;. I'm not quite sure how to anwser 
this. In the case of &#34;shopping&#34;, the player is not even 
making an attempt to play the game, this I feel is what makes it 
&#34;bad&#34;.

Look, people don't like cheats because they make the game 
&#34;easier&#34; somehow by either externally modifing things or 
taking advantage of in game bugs or logic. To start a game with only 
the intent to &#34;shop&#34; bypass's the natural challenge of 
&#34;playing with what you are dealt&#34;. Something similar would be 
to continally reset a solitair game until you liked the 
&#34;look&#34; of the starting set.

As for Laz runs... I don't see a problem with this as much because, 
you are PLAYING the game (however, it could be argued you are 
bypassing the rest of the levels and are jumping right to the end. 
But, as Blizz allowed a shortcut to hell, I have less of a problem 
with it).

&#62; &#62; #9). &#34;only purpose is to hold extra items?&#34;
&#62; &#62; I feel VERY strongly about this... IT IS CHEATING. I look at it like 
&#62; &#62; this, you are given a unique inventory space you have to fit items 
&#62; &#62; into within the game. You have to manage your inventory space to 
&#62; &#62; determine what items you intend to carry, what you have to give up 
&#62; &#62; etc. If blizz wanted you to have a zillion items, they would have 
&#62; &#62; given you inventory &#34;pages&#34; to fill up. Nope, blizz gave a 
&#62; &#62; static inventory space. Using other chars to expand this space is 
&#62; &#62; cheating.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #10). &#34;transfer items&#34;
&#62; &#62; Not cheating because if you find an item and it's legit, you should 
&#62; &#62; be able to put it on another char that you use as long as that char 
&#62; &#62; is *NOT* just a char to hold the item.
&#62; 
&#62; I agree with you on 10 but not on 9.  Again, what is done is exactly 
&#62; same in both cases, and I consider both to not be cheating.  It 
&#62; appears that intent plays some role in your definition of cheating.
&#62; Please explain how you approach this question.
&#62; 
&#62; Once again, thanks for a stimulating post.

Ummmmmmmmmm as I look at it, it does appear inconsistant. I guess to 
answer your question, I would have to change my answer on #10 to YES. 
As I feel strongly about #9, it does force me to obey the principle 
in #10.

I hope this answers your remaining questions.... if I have brought 
any more up, please let me know. I also appreciated your post. You 
really made me think things out a little further. Yes, it was a 
stimulating topic (I will let someone else champion it for a while).
