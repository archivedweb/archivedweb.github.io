<pre>Before I get into details, I'd like to emphasize that, in this post, 
I'm talking about people IN GENERAL.  Remember:  All generalizations 
are false- including this one.

Lestat, there are a few things which I think contribute to the plight 
you currently find yourself in.  I'll list them here, in no 
particular order.

1.  Jealousy.  This green monster can be found at the heart of many 
disputes among different people; it is in human nature.  Some of the 
legit people that you're playing with may be a tad jealous (whether 
or not they'd admit it or even realize it) of the items that they see 
you use.  It may make them feel slightly inferior to you, and they 
would really like to be able to say that they've found similar items, 
also.  An easy way for them to deal with their feelings is to dismiss 
you as a cheater.  This is a way to assuage their egos.

2.  As you mentioned, paranoia.  I'll refer to it as the 
&#34;pendulum effect.&#34;  Because people have had such bad 
experiences with cheaters, they go out of their way to avoid having 
anything to do with them.  In this case, they feel that they're 
better of to avoid playing with you &#34;just in case&#34; you happen 
to be a cheater.  In other words, they have swung TOO far the 
opposite way instead of searching for some middle ground; just as a 
pendulum does not stop in the intermediate, but only swings end-to-
end.

3.  Lack of maturity.  There are a lot of kids on battle.net, and in 
general, they have not aged to the point of being mature.  There are 
exceptions, of course- I know a 15 year-old who acts very mature for 
his age (Deathfyre, you know who you are).  And I'm not condemming 
anyone here:  I was young once, too, and would have acted in a 
similar manner.  Anyway, when you're younger and a little less sure 
of yourself, you tend to take extreme stances on issues.  Many times 
a youngster has the &#34;you're either with me or against me&#34; 
attitude.  Thus, they make the choice that you MUST be a cheater if 
you have these great items and, probably combined with #1, decide 
that they will not have anything to do with you- or even feel that 
they must flame you so that you will see the &#34;error&#34; of your 
ways and convert to theirs.  With some players, you have to take 
their posts with a grain of salt because of their age.

One last comment I'd like to make is that please do not be too harsh 
on the legit players.  After all, most would not be taking these 
stances against you if not for the cheaters hurting the game in the 
first place.

As far as advice goes, keep looking for a good clan.  Of course, I'm 
partial to DarkSniper's since I am now a member, but I know there are 
others out there.  Melissa the Sorceress has represented her clan 
(MoltenLava) well, and it sounds like an interesting one to join.  If 
you're tired of the clan life, post a response for a game time, and 
I'll join you for some co-op Diablo playing.  Like you, I've only 
dueled once, and didn't care for it at all.  I'm always happy to meet 
another adventurer who isn't into the PK'ing thing.  Plus, I know my 
stuff isn't the best, but I don't feel that this limits my ability as 
a player.  Assuming I can get my technical difficulties sorted out, 
I'd like to join you for at least one game.

Let me know, and keep those posts coming,

Aahz

P.S.  Hail, Random!  Welcome to the Strategy Forum!  Since you're 
new, I'd like to recommend you read my post entitled &#34;A second 
viewpoint&#34; [shameless plug] which is currently on page 8.  I hope 
you'll find it worth your time, and I am always interested in any 
feedback.  (Of course, this is perhaps the kind of post you were 
trying to escape from; if so, I apologize- I've never even gone into 
Ogden's Tavern.)  Thanks.</pre>
