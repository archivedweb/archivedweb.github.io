<pre>Well, the UnDead Crown is pretty cool, but your cap (+10 Dex) is a 
good choice for the rogue, so I wouldn't sweat it..

Your Fine Long Bow is good because of the plus to damage, so you 
would get about 2-9 damage, is that right?  That's not bad...but your 
Bow of Accuracy (+14 Dex) is about the same, so it's really a toss 
up.  Decide which one you like the best and sell the other to get 
money for the Long Battle Bow of Skill that Griz is offering; it 
would be far better than either of these two.

I would carry just two bows with me--Bow of the Bear & one other--and 
switch them according to the situation.  When you're fighting against 
distance-fighters like the Goatmen archers, you probably won't want 
to use the Bow of the Bear, because the knock-back can throw off your 
aim and give them another chance to fire at you.  In those 
situations, you want a nice, accurate bow.

The Bow of the Bear also doesn't work well against The Hidden--
Unseen, Stalkers, & Illusion Weavers.  The knock-back will just give 
them an opportunity to vanish again.  However, with an accurate bow, 
you can just keep plugging away at them till their heads fall off.  :)

But keep the Bow of the Bear, because its knock-back can help to keep 
you alive in the Cats--especially when fighting against large numbers 
of close-in fighters or against unique monsters that are hard to kill.

The Bow of the Bear is the poor-man's Windforce, and it comes in 
handy even in the Caves--it can keep those Overlords and Horned 
Demons off you.  So hang on to it till you get something better.

hope this helps, cya on b.net sometime</pre>
