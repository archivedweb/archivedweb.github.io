<pre>While waiting for the replies to my survey below (I already see 
something interesting going on which I will explain later), I thought 
I would tell anyone curious about my night last night.

I started a Hell mode game, and started down into hell. A short while 
later I hear some plate mail fall out. I run over and check it, Plate 
of Structure. I figured until I found something better to sell, I 
would keep it in my inventory. About 3 min later on the same level, I 
hear another set of plate mail fall. I check it, again Plate of 
structure! I picked them both up and compared. They were EXACTLY the 
same! Even Dur, stats ect were exactly alike. I dropped both (they 
stayed) then continued on.

On the next level I found an Amulet of Life which I kept to sell and 
promptly thereafter, another Amulet of Life! Exact same stats! I 
again dropped both (both stayed) and continued on. When I got to laz, 
Serpents Titans ring and a Serpents Lion ring (I love serpents 
stuff... always have since I found my first, Serpents Zod back in 
Feb). 

Anyway it was wierd to see so many &#34;exact&#34; items falling. 
Strange. Anyway I did finally level up to 47 (yea!) Unfortunatly even 
though I'm 733 million exp now, I still have around 600 mill before 
level 50 :( In the few games since, I have been getting Stars crap 
like crazy. I think out of 4 games I got nearly 8-9 stars rings (but 
I did get a lower Zod, +16 all). Strange evening.
