<pre>OK -- in many ways the discussion of what is and is not
&#34;cheating&#34; can get pretty silly, and you easily wind up
dissussing ridiculous niggling details which are of no
interest to anyone. All those not interested need read no
further...

But you cannot play Diablo
for 6 months without contemplating what does and does not
constitute &#34;cheating&#34; and what does and does not constitute
&#34;unethical&#34; or &#34;unacceptable&#34; play (they are not the 
same thing:
nowhere have I said that people who backup are unethical).
The sheer volume of replies to Code's post indicates that
many other people have thought a lot about this too.

As should be clear from my post above, I believe that if you
want to draw a line between what is &#34;legit&#34; and what is
&#34;cheating&#34; then you have to say that use of a third party
_Diablo_ progam is &#34;cheating&#34;.  Many may be &#34;acceptable
cheats&#34; but then you're on very subjective ground as to
which programs are ok and which aren't ok. People can and
do have many opinions about that.
 
Please note that I said &#34;Diablo backup program&#34;. You will have
to look elsewhere for a lunatic who says that making a full
backup of your hard drive is a Diablo &#34;cheat&#34; (I do back up
my hard drive, btw). Now, I think you're saying that there's
no difference between using a Diabo backup program and doing
a standard system backup, so neither involves &#34;cheating&#34;.
All I can say is I feel that there is a difference. Anyone
still reading this can take a look at Kevin Lambert's site
(which has the best backup utility) and decide what they think:

<a href="http://www.users.lith.com/~kevin/diablo/index.html">http://www.users.lith.com/~kevin/diablo/index.html</a>

I think the question of whether or not it is &#34;cheating&#34; to
backup your Diablo character hits a nerve because it's
actually very significant  (not because it's too trivial to discuss)
 -- it does make a big difference if your carefully nurtured
lvl 39 character is tucked safely away somewhere.</pre>
