<pre>&#62; 
&#62;       To illustrate my position, I'm posting what I have:
&#62; Bastard Swords:
&#62;       Soldiers sword of Blood
&#62;       King's sword of Haste (gave a broad version away)
&#62;       King's sword of Vampire
&#62;       King's sword of Titan
&#62;       King's sword of Gore
&#62;       King's sword of Sorcery
&#62;       Champion's sword of Haste
&#62; King's Flail of Haste
&#62; 3 StormShield
&#62; 2 Gotther (unided)
&#62; 1 Helm of Sprits
&#62; 1 Helm of Royal Circlet (gave one away)
&#62; 1 Thinking cap (gave 2 away)
&#62; 1 Naj's plate
&#62; I have AAA(12 charges) AA resurrect(10 charges) AA Fireball (56 
&#62; charges)
&#62; Tons of rings about 5 Zodiac.
&#62; 1 obs of wiz (40&#37; 27magic)
&#62; 1 obs of lion (40&#37; 55 hp)
&#62; 1 obs (40&#37;)
&#62; 1 constricting ring. and etc
&#62; 1 windforce
&#62; I have seen AAN, AAW(+30), tossed Dreamflanges, cause I like AA 
&#62; better and have strong weapon and sheild for triple immues), lots of 
&#62; apocs, and etc.
&#62; have 3 awesome plates. (1 has 19 dex added, another with max ac of 
&#62; 183)&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; ****Now My Frustration*****
&#62;  What do you think?  Am I a cheater in your eyes due to my stuff? 

I think your items are perfectly reasonable for someone who plays a 
lot.  You are not a cheater based upon the things listed.
 
&#62; Should I expect the response I get?  Are most legit people too 
&#62; paranoid? 

Legit people are paranoid the same way that a 'recovering alcoholic' 
is paranoid about drinking.  They don't want to be drawn into the 
cheating thing.  Just like you wouldn't 'dis' a recovering alcoholic 
for not wanting to drink, you shouldn't 'dis' legit players who want 
to make sure their characters stay legit.  Just accept the fact that 
legit players (most of them) are going to have quite a paranoid 
streak about cheating. 

&#62; Please give me, some of your thoughts.  
&#62; I'm beginning to think about Retiring Diablo complete. :(

I think your stuff is very reasonable.  Most of it is a little better 
than mine, but some is a little worse than mine.  People that accuse 
you of cheating obviously don't play a lot, or suck at playing.  Keep 
playing ONLY if it still interests YOU to play.  I'm thinking of 
retiring when both my mage and rogue are at level 40.  Or at least 
greatly cutting back on playing.
