<pre>Based on your post, two &#34;of Blood&#34; items don't combine to
steal 10&#37; life. But I've noticed that an &#34;of Blood&#34; helm 
and a sword of vampires WILL work together, stealing both
5&#37; life and 5&#37; mana.

My question is, will a helm such as the Helm of Spirits and
a sword of the leech (steal 3&#37; life) combine to 
steal 8&#37; life?

PS. The Helm of Spirits is not the only helmet that 
steals life. The Undead Crown does as well. In single player 
you can get it by killing Leoric; in multi-player it appears
randomly.

&#62; To all,
&#62; 
&#62;          I have recently have done a test on Blood Suffix.
&#62; 
&#62; The Items that are used are soldier's bastard sword of blood and Helm 
&#62; of Sprits (Unique)  Both takes 5&#37; hp.  If you attack a monster 
&#62; like Blood Knight and you did 100 points of Damage, you'll gain 5 hp 
&#62; back.  Now, the true test was on the case of 'what if you added 2 
&#62; blood items.'  The only possibilities are Helm of Sprits with a Sword 
&#62; of Blood.  I equiped my warrior who finally found the soldiers's 
&#62; bastard sword of blood few days ago.  Since only the Helm of Sprits 
&#62; were put on and off, the damage range was same (Max, Min and average 
&#62; Hp gain was same :).  I Stoned the same monster, I think it was Azure 
&#62; Drake.  And Hit him many times and recorded the Hp received each hit. 
&#62;  The findings were same weather or not if the Helm of Sprits were 
&#62; worn or not.  Therefore, if you found the Helm of Sprits like me, use 
&#62; a sword that doesn't have Blood suffix since it won't help you.  I am 
&#62; using King's bastard sword of Haste (bought from Gris), so I'm 
&#62; getting blood in hasted form.  It's really great.  Any warrior out 
&#62; there should seek out for the Helm of Sprits, since it'll help you 
&#62; out.  It's most useful if you are a high lvl warrior since the AC on 
&#62; the Helm of Sprits is only 6. :(  Good Hunting everyone. :)

&#62;      Lestat, lost and confused.</pre>
