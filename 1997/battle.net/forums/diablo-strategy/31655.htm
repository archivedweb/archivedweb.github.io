&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; This is a simple survey of what people concider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; &#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; &#62; is or is not, cheating.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
&#62; 
&#62; No, if the gold the other player obtained is legit. If they just 
&#62; created gold on the spot to give to you, it is wrong to accept it. If 
&#62; you battled through the dungeons for it, and he gives it to you, it's 
&#62; fine.

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?
&#62; 
&#62; No, to a point. No level 1 character should have, say an Obsidian 
&#62; Ring of the Zodiac.  If you are level 1, you should only accept items 
&#62; you would be able to 1) use and 2) obtain within the next say, 5 - 7 
&#62; levels above your current level.  If you accept items that are 
&#62; clearly well beyond your limits at the moment, then you essentially 
&#62; are not playing the game for what it is worth. There isn't much point 
&#62; if you are level 5 and screaming through the dungeons not bothering 
&#62; being attacked by anything and you can go to hell and back without 
&#62; being hurt. Yea, that was a bit of an exaggeration but I made my 
&#62; point.

I think any items can be accepted as long as they are legitimate.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62; 
&#62; No, not if you can pay for it legitimately and use the item 
&#62; legitimately. You are IN the game, and that is part of your current 
&#62; game. Not to contradict my previous statements, you are NOT accepting 
&#62; a gift from a higher level player...this is a transaction between 
&#62; yourself and the Blacksmith with a &#34;middle man&#34;. However I 
&#62; would suggest that it would be more in &#34;the spirit of the 
&#62; game&#34; to stick with what I previously said and only have the 
&#62; character purchase it if you are within close level proximity.

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; &#62; elixers?
&#62; 
&#62; If the elixers are obtained legitimately, no.
&#62; I mean, the higher level chars aren't going to have 40 elixers to 
&#62; give out...one or two doesn't affect the game that much.

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
&#62; 
&#62; Nope. One character killing monsters to aid another character is only 
&#62; nice :)

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; &#62; Adria or Griz for items?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Uh, no...that is a silly question :)  You can start a game at any 
&#62; time to check for items...it isn't illegal. Nothing prohibits it, and 
&#62; I'm sure everyone does it. Since whenever you start a game it is 
&#62; randomized, it really makes no difference whether you start 1 or 100 
&#62; games until you find items you like...Starting a new game is not 
&#62; cheating :)

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I'm unfamiliar with &#34;deye&#34; but any utility that allows you to 
&#62; look at another character is cheating. You can't see those stats 
&#62; normally, so you should not be allowed to see them using any sort of 
&#62; utility.

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; &#62; could not regularly access?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; No. That is just lending a helpful hand. It is actually more 
&#62; strategic than it is cheating...Allowing a low level character into a 
&#62; low level dungeon increases their chances for dying, so it poses 
&#62; risks for them...however clearing hell, lets say, and then portaling 
&#62; in a level 1 character to pick up the gold and items IS cheating...no 
&#62; character that low should be in hell in that situation.

I agree, but I think that if a level 1 went down to hell and 
collected all the stuff that is fine. As long as the stuff is legit.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; &#62; items?
&#62; 
&#62; No...They are only items you obtained legally, and therefore holding 
&#62; them in another players inventory is perfectly legal.

I agree.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
&#62; 
&#62; YES. That is cheating. One character has NOTHING to do with another 
&#62; one, and transfering items between characters is wrong. You find what 
&#62; you find, and if one char is lucky, and one isn't, tuff luck for 
&#62; him...

I think that it is not cheating. It is kind of like one character is 
friends with another one and they are just giving items to the other 
one. It just happens that both characters are yours.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
&#62; 
&#62; PKilling is not cheating. It may be lame, but it's legal.

I agree that it is not cheating. But pking isn't lame. :)
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

No it is not. This is perfectly ok. It is one way of killing that is 
deceptive and if they fall for it....

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; You accomplish nothing by doing it...so no. I didn't even realize you 
&#62; could.

I think it is cheating. It makes it so one person can get somewhere 
in town before you. So if I was going to go down to helloa nd wait 
for the other guy to duel. I want to be down first so he won't ambush 
me. I get a big head start. But he teleports to the entrance and gets 
down first and ambushes me. It is then cheating. So yes it is 
cheating.

&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Nope...that's just protecting yourself from an angry system. Nothing 
&#62; wrong with backing up characters. Of course, if you die somewhere and 
&#62; lose your items, it is cheating to load up your backed up character 
&#62; with all his items and starting a new game...

I'm not sure. On the top i'd say no. As long as it's only if the 
system crashes and you lose your character all together. If you are 
restoring to get lost items back then it is cheating. But one thing 
that makes me wonder. If your system crashes and it affects your 
files wouldn't it affect the backed up ones as well? I don't know to 
much about this but anyway.

&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Anwer honestly! I'll post later with my views on the above later 
&#62; &#62; today.
