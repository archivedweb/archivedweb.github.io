&#62;    You poor bastard.  Why did you let all that stuff lay there?!?!  
&#62; That's a dragon's hoarde of ultra-rare treasure!  You should have 
&#62; read my post (I think it's on index 4 or 5 now...July 10 entitled 
&#62; ***TIRED OF LOSING YOUR STUFF?**** or something like that).  You 
&#62; could have had it all back......SIGH.  What a shame.  I have played 
&#62; for several months and haven't come up with items like that.  Oh 
&#62; well, maybe you will be lucky again.  Good luck in recovery mon ami.

Jolly Ol' St. Mick,
Thanx for the quasi-sympathy.  I had read your post about losing the
stuff.  Unfortunately, there really was no way for me to impliment
any good recovery strategies.  As a warrior, I had neglected magic 
completely until about level 26 (now level 28), so I had no teleport
or phasing.  The first deaths (wife's and mine) occurred pretty close 
to the stairs.  I went down with my backup stuff on and tried to 
recover, but was killed even closer to the stairs.  By that time,
we had NO equipment, little money (about 10k, I think), and i had
no effective magic.  I went down naked a coupel times (only a belt
of potions), but the lava demons (or whatever they were specifically)
offed me before I could even drink the second one!!  I couldn't even
move through the horde to lure them away; if I had had a spell, I 
would never have been able to cast it (being a warrior and all).

We tried to go through the church and cats, in hopes of 
building/buying enough stuff for a last=ditch recovery effort.  
Unfortunately, on the last church level, my wife died, and i was 
about to (poor tactics--i went into a room, and couldn't withdraw-my 
computer said she was blocking the door, but hers said she was out of
the way--what a clusterf__k!!!).  In desperation, I quit  the game 
before I actually kicked off, in order to save the stuff I had 
accumulated to that point.

The moral of the story--it really is just a game.  I look forward to 
trying a normal hell run with crappy stuff, trying to build up our
arsenal again!!  (although, I'd rather have kept the stuff . . .THREE
ZODIACS, man--two with suffixes!!!)

If you're interested, I'll let you know what I get.  If I get some 
good stuff, I'll keep it for trade?  (dont' worry--i usually play
direct connect, and I have never duped, so me and my wife are 
150&#37; legit).

A sad, but determined, Boots</pre>
