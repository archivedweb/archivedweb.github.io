<blockquote>
<pre>Lorax's point is an excellent one: not everyone is 100&#37; legit or 
non-legit; there are degrees of legitmacy.  People are not either all 
good or all evil, saved or damned; people are more complex than these 
binary opposites.

I have posted anti-cheater messages to this list because I believe 
that cheating makes the game boring and pointless.  However, I only 
believe that because of my own experience cheating.  My first 
manifestation of Skyye was really only semi-legit.  

I originally started a mage character who (around lvl 32-35) found 
both Eaglehorn and Windforce in a couple of days of each other.  I 
didn't want to sell them, so I started a rogue character and gave 
them to her.  I also gave her an Awesome Plate of Stars (AC 45, +11 
all) and a Jade Ring of Titans so she could use all this stuff 
sooner. 

I didn't consider it cheating at the time, because I legitimately 
found the stuff.  And, my mage was my main character, so I didn't 
care too much about Skyye.  But, like other converts, I came to love 
the rogue the best, and Skyye soon became my main character.  In 
time, I also found other Eaglehorns and Windforces and better armor, 
so I didn't think that I had done anything particularly wrong.

But, after I maxed out early & easily, and generally didn't find 
items much better than what I started my 'career' with, the 
excitement of the game soon faded.   

So I restarted Skyye.  I deleted her at lvl 36, and now she's back up 
to lvl 30, completely legit.  And I found Eaglehorn legitimately, and 
it was a very cool moment!

So I'm legit now, but even that condition is somewhat is somewhat 
tainted: I do use a backup program because I don't thing Blizzard 
considered system crashes to be part of the game.  

And I say that I will never use the backup program illegitimately, 
what happens if I hit lvl 40 and I get MK'd in Hell/Hell because of 
some twit I happen to be playing with in an open game on b.net.  Am I 
gonna resist the urge to restore all my cool stuff that I took so 
long to acquire?  I honestly can't answer that until it happens.  

So anyway, I see Lorax's point very clearly.  And I also understand 
Code Myster's perspective also.  I may not agree completely with 
Code, but I certainly agree that PK's are worse than most cheaters 
(although, all to often, people who are one are both).  

I still remember getting PK'd by some a**hole who then told me that 
he was a &#34;legit PK&#34;, as if that made it all OK.

And you know what?  It didn't.  </pre>
