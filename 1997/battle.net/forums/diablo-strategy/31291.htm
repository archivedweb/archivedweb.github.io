<pre>&#62; &#62;  When FMF started his clan, he did most on his own(whats that Twig? 
&#62; &#62; Sorry I'm deaf in one ear). He did a lot for this clan, and he still 
&#62; &#62; does. It will be an unfair accusation to say he does not do much. 
&#62; &#62; Where did you get that idea from anyway?
&#62; 
&#62; why dont u read his post above??? he said it himself! he doesnt have 
&#62; to do much cos hes got others to do the page and others to watch the 
&#62; guild. i never said he didnt do anything in the beginning, of course 
&#62; he did, he started th clan! but a good leader should always do the 
&#62; best for his or her clan.

Actually, a couple notes.  I only receive help in two things.  I 
receive help in checking new applicants for acceptance, and also I 
receive help in keeping the members listing current.  All else (which 
is basically the running of the guild) is done by me alone.

&#62; &#62;  I have respect for Fire_made_Flesh(more than you hee hee),
&#62; 
&#62; do i care? i dont even know u.

If you don't care, why bother posting a reply?  If you TRUELY didn't 
care, you'd just let it go.

&#62; &#62; he has 
&#62; &#62; made mistakes many times, but then so has I. He got the guild running 
&#62; &#62; much by itself, if that isn't a sign of leadership I don't know what 
&#62; &#62; is. In fact, some of the members insisted on taking the 
&#62; &#62; responsibilities, they wanted to do something for the clan, they do 
&#62; &#62; not want to have a free ride, FMF needs help, they volunteered. Some 
&#62; &#62; of the clan members still want to take some things of FMF's hand, but 
&#62; &#62; FMF refused and now he's still kept busy maintaining the clan. He is 
&#62; &#62; like a boss, a manager, you have the wrong impression of him.
&#62; 
&#62; maybe he should be a bit more clear in his post then.

I thought I was being extremely clear.  But then again, it's all 
interpretation.  If you were also clearer, you wouldn't have gotten 
the responses you'd have gotten.  You were EXTREMELY unclear on the 
fact that your main point was that he didn't have the knowledge of 
Diablo that would be best to run a legit guild.

&#62; &#62;  Perhaps you should know that FMF is one of the most knowlegable (on 
&#62; &#62; Diablo) person I know of. For instance, do you know that you you can 
&#62; &#62; get all 3 dots just from killing  Diablo in hell diff, there is no 
&#62; &#62; need for normal and nightmare.
&#62; 
&#62; ahhhh, yes. but what the hell does that have to do with building a 
&#62; clan?

You yourself said your main point was that the person didn't have the 
knowledge, and that you didn't elaborate on it.  Well, if that's your 
main point, and if I have much knowledge, I think that would have 
very much to do with building a clan.  After all, you said so 
yourself.

&#62; u r getting quite annoying u know. i mean critisize me if u follow 
&#62; the whole thing. if u dont just shut the hell up! 

People misinterpret all the time.  I've done it, you've done it, in 
fact, being that this is a message board, and you aren't talking real 
time so you can't clarify things if people don't understand 
completely, there are very few people that don't misinterpret 
something at some time or another.  It's just a game.  If it's 
causing you to be annoyed, then stop playing, find something else to 
entertain yourself.  I've found that bowling with other people that 
can't bowl well helps me.  That way nobody feels bad cause we all 
suck.  :)
