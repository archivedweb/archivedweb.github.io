<pre>&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

Not unless it's duped gold.  Though why some idiot would give gold 
away instead of a LOAN or something I have no idea.  Well till you 
get to nightmare anyway.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

No, unless they're duped.  It's part of the way the game was meant to 
be played.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

No.  If it's bought, no matter by who, it's legit.  Most of what you 
can buy for yourself is useless junk anyway.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

No, again providing they aren't duped.  Elixirs exist as part of the 
game, and if Blizzard didn't want little ones not only buying but not 
drinking elixirs either, they'd have made it impossible (without 
hacking anyway).

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

No, but why would you?  They don't get higher levels, only the junk 
you find.  Which you could just give to them anyway.  And if you 
clear enough, then they can't fight ANYTHING without going so deep 
they get killed instantly, so why even play?

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check &#62; 
Wirt, Adria or Griz for items?

No.  I can see this being a problem, but if they'd rather run around 
town constantly than fight, it's their waste of time.  Besides, they 
can only carry 195k of spendable gold at any one time anyway.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

Yes. I'm a purist, and any external program is considered by me to be 
a cheat.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and neither does a counter-
hack.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

No.  They could actually walk down if they wanted.  But again, if you 
can't get there, there's probably a reason for it, and you'll end up 
dead.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold &#62; 
extra items?

No, providing you use two people to handle transfers. (ie no editors 
to transfer items).  I REALLY wish they'd kept the backpack in the 
game....

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another &#62; 
char?

No. Isn't this the same as trading?  Again, only if done by two 
people, not through an editor.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

No.  If you can use a scroll, you can kill somebody.  If pking wasn't 
intended, there wouldn't be a friendly/foe setting.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

No.  If they are stupid enough to take a portal somewhere they don't 
know where leads, let them.  This is a strategy (albeit a low one) 
not a cheat.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

Yes.  As you cannot cast spells in town other than heal, you must 
hack to activate the spells.  Any hack is a cheat.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

No.  ONLY if done with file managing.  No backup programs.  All you 
have to do is copy the correct files to back them up.  That isn't 
cheating.
