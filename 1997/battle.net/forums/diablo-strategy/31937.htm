<pre>&#60;Continuing to flog a dead horse...&#62;

I think it is possible to give a fairly objective
definition of the distinction between &#34;cheat&#34;/&#34;legit&#34;
(again, no moral judgements intended). The ethical/
unethical distinction is much more subjective (and
probably a whole lot more significant!)

An objective definition of &#34;legit&#34; has to be based on the
criterion of what can or cannot be done with the game
software. Third party programs constiture &#34;cheats&#34;, as I said,
if they allow you to do things which the game does not.
In addition, bugs which are destructive to the structure
of the game, i.e. the dupe bug, also must be classified as cheats.
(This is definitely a grey area -- but I do not mean to use
the intent of the designers or ethical considerations to assess the
severity of a bug.)

Cuda Prime put it this way in Ogdens:

&#34;If you can do an action within the game then that action is not 
cheating. Belt-Dupe is excluded because Blizzard has said that it is
a bug and has attempted to remove it from the game. 

However, any action you need a third party program to do is cheating, 
period.&#34;

You cannot backup characters with Bliz's Diablo software,
so use of a third party program to do that is a &#34;cheat&#34;
(the &#34;.&#34; are supposed to remove a priori perjorative 
connotations
from the word &#34;cheat&#34;). To be consistent, I have to agree with
you that carrying out Bliz's instructions -- copying files etc.
-- would also be a &#34;cheat&#34;. Yes, Bliz is telling us to 
&#34;cheat&#34;
-- b.net will fall apart in no time!

In your definition of &#34;cheating&#34;

<a href="http://www.battle.net/forums/diablo-strategy/31682.htm">http://www.battle.net/forums/diablo-strategy/31682.htm</a>

you refer to the &#34;intentions&#34; of the game designers. I don't
believe that the team of game designers has a single  
&#34;intention&#34;
any more than a nation has a &#34;will&#34;. Furthermore,
the LAST thing Bliz wants to do is to be arbiters of what
is and is not cheating (they might get involved in threads
like this!), so how can anyone say they intended this, not that?
The &#34;cheat&#34;/&#34;legit&#34; distinction has to be based
on the software itself, not on the designer's intentions.
(OK -- I know Cuda quoted Bliz's authority for belt-duping
being a bug; so I don't go along with that part).

I agree that Bliz surely has no problem with people backing up
characters and restoring them in the event of a hard drive
crash (they didn't include multiplayer back up for many other
reasons). But that's not my criterion for &#34;legit&#34;.

Now if Bliz were to add a backup utility to the next patch,
then I'd say it was part of the game, and no longer a &#34;cheat&#34;.
But right now, I don't see that save button on my multiplayer
menu.</pre>
