<pre>Hi Melissa,

I will make sure to look you up when I logon, but since I have two 
little boys (2-1/2 and 1), I usually can't logon until after 10PM 
PST.  I guess this means that I usually won't get to see you.  Oh 
well, I'm still glad that I joined.  I did talk with a few of the 
members, and they seemed very nice, even at midnight PST!!!  Anyways, 
thanks again for the referral.

&#62; Hi!
&#62; 
&#62; I'm so glad you joined!  I looked for your name on the members list a 
&#62; couple of times cause I saw your post on our Discussion Group page 
&#62; but I didn't know to look for a different name.  Last night there 
&#62; were not a lot of people in the main channel because there was a 
&#62; tournament going on in a different channel.  That's were I was 
&#62; between 9p.m. and 11p.m. EST watching the tournament (through my 
&#62; husband's character, Ironsamson, who was one of the people running 
&#62; the tournament).  That was kind of fun to watch.  Everyone probably 
&#62; went back to the main channel around 11:45 after the tournament.
&#62; 
&#62; I should be getting on the Molten lava channel tonight between 9:30 
&#62; p.m. and 10 p.m.  I could answer any questions you have, you can 
&#62; whisper me if you don't want to &#34;talk out loud&#34;.  
&#62; 
&#62; I agree that the guild is has a lot of organizational structure that 
&#62; to some people is not necessary, but believe me, I checked out other 
&#62; guilds when I was deciding on one and some have no structure and you 
&#62; can't find on their page (if you can find their page in the first 
&#62; place) what they stand for, what they allow and don't allow, which is 
&#62; what I wanted to know.</pre>
