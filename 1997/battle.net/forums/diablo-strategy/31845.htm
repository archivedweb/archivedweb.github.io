<pre>DarkSniper,

It's obvious to me that you feel you have come under
an inordinate amount of fire lately.  I'm sorry that you 
feel that way and that it's probably in part from my 
criticism.  

I'd just like to say that, just as you don't think you own
this forum, neither does anyone else.  No one should
be able to tell you how often to post.  True, your opinions
are different from mine, but as long as they are posted
in a considerate way, I welcome them. 

I was also wondering if you read my response to your
rebuttal of my &#34;continuum&#34; post.  You haven't responded
to it yet.  I'm not trying to fan the coals or anything.  Actually, 
I wanted to make sure that you noticed that I said that
it's ok that we don't see eye to eye, and I'm willing to agree
to disagree.  Also, I was hoping that you might accept the 
apology in my post.

I think it's on the third page now, so if you haven't seen it, 
here's a link so you don't have to hunt for it.

Re to you, DS. And my view on relating Diablo to real life.

Just remember, your opinions are as valuable as anyone
else's.  You're entitled to have them and to post them.
