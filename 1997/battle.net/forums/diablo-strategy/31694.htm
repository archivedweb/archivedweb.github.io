<pre>i believe blizzard calls this game an action RPG, am i right?
so if it is an RPG the a have a few questions for u people. a mage 
would do anything to boost his powers in the magic area if magic 
existed rght? so, why does everybody want a zod ring????? a real mage 
would rather have a wyrm's ring of wizadry than a obsidian zod ring, 
corect? same with warriors, if u want to use the best magic, BE A 
MAGE!!!! stop trying to boost all your magic up to use lvl 15 
fireball! instead focus on beating the crap out of stuff! (thats what 
u are good at :). but rouges are different. sure u should boost ur 
dex up, but blizzard made them to be able to fight and use mid lvl 
spells. thats why they are the best class :) yes mages can fry 
everything naked, so why worry about a zod ring when u can use a wiz 
ring?
when u are naked u don't need strength, so to all u mages who say we 
don't need armor, DON'T USE IT THEN!!! just wear magic and mana 
boosting equipment to kick @$$!!!! i have a mage, and i love him for 
his magic prowess, but i like my rouge better for her way to easily 
handle any situiation.sure, u mages will say get her cornered and 
she's dead, but remember we can teleport to :) we also have life and 
magic to go through, and with windforce we can keep the baddies back.
but wait, we can stone things too!!!! :)
well, i know a bunch of mages, and like i said i love mine, so Aahz, 
i don't do this out of mage hate :). people will be mad at me 
starting this debate, but i am not debating, i am mearly telling 
people what an rpg is supposed to be like, e-mail me if u like, i get 
bored saoetoimes and would love to read your posts.

-alvais lvl 33 rogue LEGIT!
-alvain lvl 14 mage LEGIT!

PS, i just got fined $105.00 in court so mabye i am just pissed off 
and need to vent :) if u are a mage and i know u don't be mad, just 
give me a good slap in the face :)</pre>
