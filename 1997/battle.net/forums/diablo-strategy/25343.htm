&#62; &#62; My 29th level warrior recently found a Messerschmidt's Reaver.  I 
&#62; &#62; know the consensus best weapon for a warrior is KSOH or lesser 
&#62; &#62; versions of it.  I currently have a Knight's Mace of Haste with which 
&#62; &#62; I can do up to 53 damage with (I also carry an emerald shield).  The 
&#62; &#62; Reaver allows me to do up to 147 damage per hit (not counting the 
&#62; &#62; fire hit damage).
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; What are people's thoughts regarding using the Reaver?  It is slower, 
&#62; &#62; but the damage is almost triple.  Is it worth using (I can get 
&#62; &#62; resistances with jewelry instead of with the shield)?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Here are the stats for the Reaver:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 12-30 base damage
&#62; &#62; +200&#37; damage
&#62; &#62; +15 points of damage
&#62; &#62; +5 to all stats
&#62; &#62; -50 hp
&#62; &#62; fire hit damage 2-12
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks for the input,
&#62; &#62; Magik(Tarot)
&#62; 
&#62; I have a 50 level warrior with 1020 hp 1020 mana naked. 
&#62; I've been trying to get hacked shields to stay permanent
&#62; but have been having lots of problems, so I said screw this,
&#62; and decided to forget shields. Instead I loaded my character
&#62; with a kings sword of haste in one hand, and a kings
&#62; sword of vampires in the other. I did TONS of damage
&#62; and with the mana-stealing ability I could probably survive 
&#62; forever in normal hell without drinking a single potion.
&#62; But I went to hell/hell and got my ass kicked. I couldn't
&#62; block attacks from the knights and got hit by almost every 
&#62; projectile from the witches.
&#62; 
&#62; Basically a warrior sucks without a shield. Shields
&#62; will enable you to block a good percentage of projectiles
&#62; and most physical attacks (which a warrior experiences a lot),
&#62; not to mention the extra armor class and other bonuses. 
&#62; 
&#62; Rogues can tread carefully, drawing out enemies a couple at a time, 
&#62; and pick them off with their bows without coming near an enemy. 
&#62; Mages can teleport right in, let off 5 chain lightnings and 
&#62; 10 fireballs, and teleport out relatively unscathed. But warriors 
&#62; have to face enemies in hand-to-hand combat - they need shields
&#62; more than any other class.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, if you had a one-handed M's reaver (which is pretty easy 
&#62; to hack) it might be OK.
&#62; 
&#62; Then again, do whatever you want. It might be fun to play the
&#62; game through as an axe-wielding warrior.  Everyone says that
&#62; sorcerers are the best class, but I've had the most fun
&#62; (in legit games) with rogues, who don't need to drink 10 potions
&#62; just to clear out a level.


you know what, though? WE DON'T CARE WHAT U THINK!!!!   you are 
another damned cheater that makes the game suck... get a life.</pre>
