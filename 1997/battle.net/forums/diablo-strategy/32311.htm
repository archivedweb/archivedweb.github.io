<pre>Errr...did you get the email I sent you?  Or, perhaps a better 
question is HOW MANY TIMES did you get the email I sent you?  See, I 
was having some email problems at the office.  I sent out your email 
first thing yesterday morning, and it came back with some kind of 
&#34;host unknown&#34; error.  I sent it out again thinking I had 
typed in your address wrong.  Again it came back.  At this point I 
figured I had copied down your email incorrectly in the first place.  
Then I sent out some other emails and they came back- and these were 
to addresses that I knew were correct.  So, of course, I sent the 
same message out from my home account.  Today I see that some of my 
emails that supposedly bounced back actually went through.  So, I 
apologize profusely if you got my annoying email multiple times.  To 
prevent me from sending anything else out, just post something here 
to that effect.  Better yet, just send back a short email saying 
something like, &#34;I got your email.  Quit sending me messages you 
annoying little twit!&#34;  Again, sorry.

Ummm...in the unlikely event that you didn't get the message, could 
you please send a short message over to me so that I have your 
correct address?  (You know, something like &#34;Here's my real 
address, dumbass!&#34;).  I would appreciate it.

Hey, I really enjoyed seeing the results of your light radius 
experiment.  That's something I never would have thought of.  It got 
me to thinking...  Do you suppose the reason why Infravision is only 
available in scroll form is because a Blizzard tester discovered this 
method of playing late in the testing process?  Like maybe they 
didn't have time to rewrite the AI code of the monsters, so instead 
only allowed Infravision to be on scrolls?  Oh well, just a theory...

Anyway, take it easy, and let's adventure together again soon.
