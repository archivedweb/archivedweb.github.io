&#62; &#62; 3. An interesting note on guardian is that the spell does seem to 
&#62; &#62; hurt your coop player. I was grouped with a rogue, and we had 
&#62; &#62; illusion weavers. The weavers would show up on the rogue or me, and 
&#62; &#62; the guardians would hit the rogue a lot. It seems that if you are 
&#62; &#62; close to a guardian, and in a line of fire between it and its target, 
&#62; &#62; you will get hit (although the guardian does not seem to hit me). Has 
&#62; &#62; anyone else noticed this? The rogue was not to pleased with my 
&#62; &#62; guardians killing her a couple times.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; Guardians are very hard on rogues.  Not only do we get
&#62; hit by their fireballs (both directly and &#34;splash&#34; damage it 
&#62; seems),

They fire firebolts, not fireballs, so there is no splash damage. 
Probably a guardian just hitting you with half of the firebolt and it 
looks like splash damage. Yes, I wish they threw fireballs.

&#62; but three or four can fill the screen with so much moving stuff
&#62; we can't see to aim (and _nobody_ likes that! :-) and worst of
&#62; all, every blooming critter in this room and all surrounding
&#62; rooms comes charging out at you all at once.  Then Mr. Hotshot
&#62; mage panicks and starts making like Nintendo Kid with the fire
&#62; button set for Chain Lightning.  
&#62; 
&#62; Great.  Now your 150-200 hp lvl 30+ rogue has lightning, 
&#62; fireballs, _and_ monsters beating on her simultaneously, plus 
&#62; the screen is so cluttered she can't see what's going on.  I do 
&#62; not find this to be a very comfortable (or pleasant) situation 
&#62; to be in.  My mage and I had several intense discussions 
&#62; about this strategy before I was able to convince him that
&#62; this was a strategy best left for solo play.

Ok, let me address this point. The mage should not throw guardians in 
front of him, between the monsters and the party, at least in a 
multiplayer game. This is because warriors and some rogues will 
charge right into the mess of monsters and kill them, all the while 
they are getting hit in the butt by guardian. Try casting guardians 
in the midst of advancing monsters or behind monsters that are lined 
up  fighting the frontliners. It avoids that friendly fire problem.

Guardian is also really great against the non-immune (and I mean just 
non-immune, resist it works too) teleporters. The wizards are kept 
busy teleporting to fire.

But seriously, I ABUSE guardian. I use it almost more than chain 
lightning. As far as I am concerned, if I never see the monster, it 
is still a clean kill.

Another note, did you know you can stone curse monsters you can see 
with infravision, even behind walls?</pre>
