&#62;  Maybe I'm just seeing the glass as half empty here, but I think this 
&#62; whole Godly does not exist speil everyone has been spouting here is a 
&#62; bunch of crap.  
&#62;  First of all, whoever said that Godly plate (with no other info-just 
&#62; Godly plate of any sort) does not exist for real is either severly 
&#62; lacking in playing time to make such a statement or a liar.  I have 
&#62; been offered Godly Breast plate from Wirt on a couple of occasions, 
&#62; and once it was of the Whale (I was thinking of buying it just as a 
&#62; trophy, but didn't have the cash-it was like 110-120k).  
&#62;  As for it only existing in Single player, I find that ridiculous.  
&#62; If anything, it should be offered only in MULTI player.  Anyone who's 
&#62; played single player knows that if you had godly plate, even Field 
&#62; plate, you'd be almost invincible to anything in single.  Since it 
&#62; does exist there though (so I've heard...not that lucky when I played 
&#62; through), it is obviously going to be easier to get (I found awesome 
&#62; gothic on an armor stand at level 22 with my s.p. sorcerer), so it 
&#62; makes sense that it's been seen there, but that doesn't mean that it 
&#62; doesn't exist in multi as well.
&#62;  A friend of mine whom I play with on modem occasionally, and who 
&#62; actually introduced me to Diablo when he showed me the pre-release 
&#62; demo back in November, and who accquired the game around the same 
&#62; time I did (early January), told me that he FOUND Godly full plate in 
&#62; a barrel in hell.  I know what you're thinking, in a barrel?!?!? Yeah 
&#62; right!  
&#62;  This individual is a very reliable source, and this incident 
&#62; supposedly occured at a time before it was possible for some ghost to 
&#62; drop the item from thin air.  I personally am slightly skeptical, but 
&#62; do tend to believe that this did happen.
&#62;  Holy items are another controversy here, it seems.  In my Diablo 
&#62; career, and it's been a long one, I have seen about 20 items with the 
&#62; holy prefix, and most of them have been crapola.  Two days ago 
&#62; (Tuesday) one of my wizards was able to buy a Holy Gothic Shield of 
&#62; the Ages, AC 18, +167&#37; from Wirt for about 60k (he also got 
&#62; offered Awesome Full Plate from gris-AC 74 +143&#37; His AC is now 
&#62; 290!).  I also bought a friend a Holy Crown I saw a while back.  
&#62; Anyway, it seems to me that Holy items are actually more rare than 
&#62; Godly ones, but this may just be a fluke.

I'm very much torn on this issue. I can absolutely vouche that GPOW 
(Full Plate) is offered in Single Player (I bought it).

Next, I have been to hell and back in diablo (hehehe that sorta 
turned into a pun) and in all my days, I have NEVER seen ANYTHING 
Godly dropped... ever. 

I do however, know of a limited number of people I trust, one of 
which bought a set of Godly Full Plate in Multi. It's easy to 
&#34;suspect&#34; the person of cheating with exception of 1 thing I 
found out about her GPOW. It is PERFECT! +100HP, +200&#37; armor! I 
have seen the dups being passed around. I have asked in trading post 
if ANYONE has perfect GPOW, todate, I have not seen nor heard of a 
set with the same stats. This inclines me to believe that she *DID* 
buy it. As for the question of &#34;where&#34; she bought it, well, 
lucky for her, she was in a game with 2 other people (btw: one of the 
other two was offered Normal AC42 GPOW plate).

So I do think it's possible to buy it in Multi. I think it's nearly 
impossible to find in Multi in the levels (however, my char has 
always been a &#34;ring monster&#34; ... I find slews of rings 
usually, it could be that other chars by machine settings or 
whatever, can be more lucky at finding armor.... Ooooo I remember 
something.

I once, months ago, hacked up a char for each char class at my work 
and spend a day running to wirt with different settings for each char 
(ie: stats, levels etc) trying to see if there was any type of 
pattern to item generation (damn good thing my boss doesnt hang out 
in here :). What I found was that a Warrior was offered Godly stuff 
earlier and more often than a Rogue (assuming same levels etc, but 
regardless, it always favored the Warrior)!. The Rogue was favored by 
Adria for Staffs and the Sorcerer kinda got it in the shorts.

The Warrior always seemed to get offered &#34;nearly&#34; usable 
items from wirt. Maybe if any warriors can answer if they have 
noticed anything. Anyway in each case, Godly stuff became the norm 
once the Warrior reached Level 35 and the Rogue 39 (the Sorcerer 
again, wasn't offered anything frequent enough to draw conclusions).

Anyway I did last night find out some of the most AMAZING and 
STARTLING things in ALL my Diablo playing days.... I took screen 
shots for the those who won't believe. Look for a post later will the 
details (I'm very much shaken up about this btw as it has destroyed 
alot of my Diablo belief's). Oh and one other thing about last night, 
I found the best set of armor I ever have (via creature drop) in all 
my Diablo days.... Awesome Full Plate of Harmony.

To not believe that a creature might someday drop GPOW is like giving 
up on the belief of Santa Claus. I'd just assume &#34;its out 
there... maybe 1 more game&#34; hehehehehe
