&#62; &#62; Summary: Blizzards Diablo has broken new ground. It has brought up 
&#62; &#62; new questions that are VERY hard to answer. Game Ethics are now at 
&#62; &#62; the heart of alot of most game discussions and game designs now.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Games such as UO are going to be constantly monitored to force 
&#62; &#62; players to play the game as intended allowing less &#34;freedom&#34; 
&#62; &#62; to the individual players.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; As for the current state of Diablo, Cheating has made everyone 
&#62; &#62; &#34;equal&#34;. There is no need to kill others unless you are 
&#62; &#62; either PK or PK hunter. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Now, people stay out of public games for 2 reasons. #1 is that they 
&#62; &#62; wish to avoid PK's. #2 is that they wish to avoid &#34;cheaters&#34;. 
&#62; &#62; Had Diablo existed &#34;cheat free&#34;, everyone would still be 
&#62; &#62; avoiding public games because of a more serious threat, the threat of 
&#62; &#62; getting MK'ed and losing everything they own.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Which Diablo would be better? I do not know... if I had to answer, I 
&#62; &#62; would take Diablo in it's current state than this senario I have 
&#62; &#62; presented. I have played with alot of cheaters, most have been very 
&#62; &#62; fun to play with. I have also played with PK's.... not a single one 
&#62; &#62; of them has been at all &#34;fun&#34;. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; You will have to answer this question for yourself.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;             -=/ Code Myster /=-
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;Cheaters&#34; tend to be boring to play with, and are often 
&#62; bored themselves.  
&#62; While this obviously has its exceptions, it is usually true.  It just 
&#62; comes with 
&#62; the territory of having everything too easy.  While sometimes 
&#62; annoying 
&#62; when they use their boosted items/powers to kill all the monsters or 
&#62; otherwise take the challenge of the game away, they are relatively 
&#62; harmless, and an unwanted encounter with one is easily remedied by
&#62; gracefully backing out of the game, if asking them to stop doesn't 
&#62; work.
&#62; 
&#62; Cheaters have managed to spoil open trading on bnet, but that is 
&#62; mostly a
&#62; technical problem.  It could be solved in the future with the 
&#62; generation
&#62; of unique ID's (as used in Windows 95/NT object registry) and server
&#62; registration of ownership.
&#62; 
&#62; PKillers, thieves, spammers, foul-mouths, and loosers who whisper
&#62; annoying or offensive messages to everyone with a feminine name can
&#62; all be lumped together as juvenile jerks who take advantage of the
&#62; faceless anonymity of the internet to engage in social behavior which
&#62; would be unacceptable anywhere outside of a correctional 
&#62; institution.  They are twisted perverts who get their jollies preying 
&#62; on 
&#62; innocent people, yet they are too cowardly to do it in person, 
&#62; prefering
&#62; the safety of hiding behind their computer.  Anyone behaving like they
&#62; do in public would be a social outcast, if not imprisoned or
&#62; institutionalized.  
&#62; 
&#62; You constantly hear them say &#34;it's only a game&#34; or &#34;its 
&#62; just for fun&#34;, as if
&#62; that somehow excuses rudeness.  Most parents punish their children if 
&#62; they play with others like these jerks do.  Yet the fact that there 
&#62; is no
&#62; way to &#34;enforce&#34; polite social behavior, and no chance of 
&#62; retaliation or
&#62; negative consequences for their actions, emboldens them to continue
&#62; their anti-social behavior.  
&#62; 
&#62; I shudder to think what may happen in the future when the thrill of 
&#62; this 
&#62; &#34;harmless&#34; preying on the innocent wears off.  What's next 
&#62; when 
&#62; nobody is around to abuse on bnet, or the thrill gets too weak to 
&#62; stimulate anymore?  What is the next level of attack, another game?  
&#62; Eventually all the games will pale.  Then what, go for real money?  
&#62; How about real people?  Its a long road from killing some 9 year old 
&#62; trying out battlenet for the first time to assaulting a real human, 
&#62; but 
&#62; the willingness to do the one (and the pleasure derived from it) 
&#62; indicates 
&#62; that the only thing preventing the other may be the cowardliness of 
&#62; the 
&#62; perpetrator.
&#62; 
&#62; Sorry about the preaching, but this b.s. I keep hearing about its ok
&#62; because its a game is just that, B.S.  If I agree to a competitive, 
&#62; everyone for himself game, its OK.  But if I want to play a nice,
&#62; friendly, _cooperative_ game, why can't I do it without worrying
&#62; about some pimple-faced nerd intentionally trying to ruin it for me?
&#62; After all, it IS a GAME.  Why can't we play &#34;nice&#34; together?
&#62; 
&#62; I guess that all goes to show that I, too, prefer playing in an 
&#62; environment filled with cheaters, to one filled with ruthless
&#62; player killers.  If I wanted that, I would go back to doom or quake 
&#62; where the whole object is to kill each other.
&#62; 
&#62; Now I have a question to pose on top of yours:
&#62; 
&#62; Does anyone think battlenet would/could have lasted even a 
&#62; month without private games?  
&#62; 
&#62; These are the only way to play together with people outside of 
&#62; your house, while still exercising control over who you play with.  
&#62; Without this ability, I think battlenet, and quite possibly Diablo, 
&#62; would have been a radically different &#34;community&#34;.  I wonder
&#62; just what kind of &#34;community&#34; Ultima Online will produce, 
&#62; without
&#62; that ability to ever let your guard down and just enjoy the game
&#62; with friends, without worrying about some stranger coming in to
&#62; hose your game for the &#34;fun&#34; of it.
&#62; 






 I have to say this is one of the best and most thought out responses 
I have ever heard. Keep it up!</pre>
