<pre>The four of a cleared the first level and wer progressing through the 
second when suddenly on my screen O+Daria+O-II(O) just stopped and I 
got no response to a message.  My wife saw the same thing while 
Whatdidihiti-II(W) continued on to another room. We assumned O was 
AFK and continue on after W who fell in a swrm of monsters, equipment 
flying in all directions.  I asked W if he wanted Res and he replied 
that he was coming back from town. We waited and found we could not 
pick up non-magical cape dropped by monster, and were worried that 
something was wrong and W might lose equipment. W comes back in picks 
up nothing and we tell him that we coulnt pick up the new stuff and 
hope his has no problem getting his stuff.  He says O brought it up 
to him in town! We never saw him in the room.  We get back to town, W 
is directing us around, he can see all 4 of us.  And he can speak to 
all of us, and he is also the only one who sees what everyone types. 
So he led us off to a new game where we went on to defeat the dreaded 
Butcher</pre>
