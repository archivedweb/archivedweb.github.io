<pre>This is interesting.  If all your comments are correct, they were 
both on the ground before you ID'd the second (one in town and the 
other when it was 'dropped' in hell.  Only after you ID'd it was it 
considered a dupe.

While I can't explain why, I can say I have had similar thing happen. 
 There were 2 of us playing one evening.  We always drop our gold to 
free up space in our inventory (we play co-op and share everything 
anyway).  After a great run on level 15, we both went up to ID items, 
and sell the items that we would not keep.  When we were dropping our 
gold, (we only drop full piles of 5000), we got a 'dupe item deleted' 
message.  We were both shocked, since we have plenty of cash, and we 
both don't dupe.  The only thing I could think of is that there were 
so many piles of 5000, one just happened to have the same traits as 
another, and was considered a dupe.

That leads me to a question.  I assume that that there is some random 
generator that places a unique trait number on items to prevent this 
from happening.  If that is the case it is possible to lose a legit 
item to the 'duping' check just by a freak coincidence.  Thus the 
more gold we had laying around, the more likely of this happening, 
but for it to happen with 2 items - that must be extremely unlikely.

Does anyone know if this is the case?</pre>
