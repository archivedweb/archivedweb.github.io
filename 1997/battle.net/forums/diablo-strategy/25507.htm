&#62; Pet Peeves?
&#62; 
&#62; I love it when people explode from there pet peeves just as Tempus 
&#62; did.  So I just kept pushing his buttons and he really blew up.
&#62; 
&#62; Now look at what I have done, All you people are sitting here 
&#62; talking about something as remedial as grammer.
&#62; 
&#62; What have we been reduced to?  No more Diablo Talk?
&#62; 
&#62; Step back and take a look at what english is anyway....
&#62; 
&#62; It's a form of communication, granted some use better grammer than 
&#62; others.
&#62; 
&#62; Obviously when I used the word &#34;Your&#34; in that context it may 
&#62; or may not have been good grammer. &#34;Who&#34; the hell cares.  The 
&#62; one thing to realize is, everyone understood the meaning, that's the 
&#62; beauty of it.  
&#62; 
&#62; If you self-centered people would just stop and think, there are many 
&#62; forms of languages in the world, english is not the only one.  The 
&#62; trick being that we are communicating.
&#62; 
&#62; And did I find a button on Tempus.... :)
&#62; 
&#62; Have a nice day...

The joke is on us??? Yeah... that's (that is) a good one! You know, 
after reading this post, I think you're (you are) more of a dumb ass 
now. You must be a pathetic piece of shit to come back and say 
(paraphrasing of course) &#34;oh, oh... I meant to do that to get a 
rise out of him&#34;. Why don't you just own up to the fact that you 
are an incompetent, illiterate, moron who can't (can not) own up to a 
minor mistake. Rather try to justify it to a bunch of people you 
know... not now, and likely, never will. Are you really that 
insecure? Grow up!! ... the joke is on us... puuuuulease, nice 5th 
grade remark. BTW, you can sign up for a remedial ENGLISH course at 
your local community college...</pre>
