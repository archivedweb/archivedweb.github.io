<pre>I'm glad you &#34;picked up&#34; on my post of finding more Armor 
items while Naked. I have known of this for a while and even have 
posted the results of this style of hunting on and off over the past 
few months. As the cats truely out of the bag now, I'll devulge other 
oddities I have noticed. 

Disclaimer: these are things I have noticed with my char... if you 
try to replicate these results, I would recommend at least 10 games 
if you don't immediatly see results. But as everyones chars are 
different, this may not work with your char. I used a Rogue char, 
ranging in levels from 38-47. It seems consistant.

If you don't wear armor your drops will be aliased towards armor.
If you don't wear ANY Jewelery, you will find LOADS.
If you are a rogue, use a low, non-magical bow and you will notice 
better bow drops.
If your stats all get lowered by 1 (some moron hitting a bad 
cauldron), you will find LOADS of uniques until you max out again.

As I have found killer rings, Windforce and imported the GPOW i 
bought from wirt in single player to multi, until I loose everything 
to
monsters, I have no need to do this type of item hunting regularly (I 
do do it off and on though).

Anyway glad you like the stragety (BTW: to seed wirt better, dont 
wear your armor or weapons when you *ENTER* the game hint hint).

later.

&#62; I was very intrigued by Code Myster's suggestion that you find better 
&#62; armor in hell when you have none, so I tried a little experiment last 
&#62; night (similar to the one Lok described in a post below).  I have 
&#62; been playing a legit level 37 mage with obsidian full plate of 
&#62; harmony, dreamflange, stormshield, royal circlet, and so-so jewelry.  
&#62; I started a normal game, immediately ditched the armor (and my spare, 
&#62; saintly gothic plate of the tiger) in town, and headed down to hell.  
&#62; I did four Laz runs, teleporting directly to level 15 and killing 
&#62; only the uniques on that level.  The results:
&#62; 
&#62; Run #1: jade gothic plate of sorcery (+28&#37;, +19, ac 59) from Laz; 
&#62; plate of the tiger (ac 47) from one of his witches; demonspike coat 
&#62; from Vizier.
&#62; 
&#62; (Needless to say, this got me pretty excited.  Armor seemed to be 
&#62; flyin' left and right; this is more than I usually find in ten Laz 
&#62; runs.)
&#62; 
&#62; Run #2: full plate of the ages from one of Laz's witches.
&#62; Run #3: nothing.
&#62; 
&#62; (I began to wonder if run #1 was just an unusually good seed.)
&#62; 
&#62; Run #4: full plate of giants from one of Laz's witches; awesome 
&#62; breast plate of sorcery from an armor rack.  (Has anyone besides me 
&#62; noticed that armor racks tend to yield unusually good prefixes and 
&#62; suffixes?)
&#62; 
&#62; Now, I have been trying to replace that obsidian full plate of mine 
&#62; for a  *long* time, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that 
&#62; this is at least two to three times more magic armor than I normally 
&#62; find.
&#62; 
&#62; So, my hypothesis?  The game is Marxist: From each according to his 
&#62; means, to each according to his needs.  This would explain why 
&#62; everyone seems to get great drops when they are forced to restart 
&#62; naked.  If true, it should also apply to other types of equipment, 
&#62; right?
&#62; 
&#62; I invite everyone to try this and refute or confirm my theory.  
&#62; Experiment, please, and post the results!
