&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; With all this in mind, i choose the warrior as the best class. Why? 
&#62; &#62; &#62; because as the game goes on its harder for him to play and strategy 
&#62; &#62; &#62; becomes much more important. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I can only agree. I think the warrior is the best class. Here are my 
&#62; &#62; reasons:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1. The warrior can play all levels solo and beat the baddies and the 
&#62; &#62; game never gets too hard / too annoying. Yes, he has problems with 
&#62; &#62; the soul burners / advocates on hell/hell, but these are about the 
&#62; &#62; only monsters I really fear with my level 40 warrior. But you can 
&#62; &#62; always stone them and when I beat them up with my KSOS, they are 
&#62; &#62; finished quite fast. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2. On the other hand, the other classes have problems with many 
&#62; &#62; monsters. The rogue is a close up second to the warrior - she has to 
&#62; &#62; carry around quite good equipment to live in hell. My rogue is level 
&#62; &#62; 39, soon 40, carries about the same equipment as my warrior (except 
&#62; &#62; for Eaglehorn instead of the KSOS and a godly shield) and she has 
&#62; &#62; about 30 AC less than him and 100 hits less. Remember: my warrior 
&#62; &#62; goes to hell/hell regularly and laughs about nightmare/hell, but my 
&#62; &#62; rogue has problems in nightmare/hell and can't do hell/hell alone. 
&#62; &#62; The monsters I fear the most are Blood Knights and Azure Drakes (and 
&#62; &#62; of course Soul Burners and Lava Maws). When there are too many of 
&#62; &#62; them so that my rogue gets stuck in a group of them, they want to see 
&#62; &#62; quite a bunch of healing potions - and if there are more thany four 
&#62; &#62; or five azure drakes, my rogue get _really_ stuck and can do nothing 
&#62; &#62; but &#34;teleport or die&#34;. Yes - you should not let your rogue 
&#62; &#62; get surrounded by enemies, but use ranged attacks instead. But what 
&#62; &#62; can you do if you play hell alone and get into a room with twenty 
&#62; &#62; enemies ? But I like the mana/magic capabilities of the rogue. 
&#62; &#62; Nevertheless, the rogue is - from my point of view - inferior to the 
&#62; &#62; warrior when used as a solo character. Now to the Mage: I never 
&#62; &#62; understood how a mage could survive hell/hell alone - after all, 
&#62; &#62; there _are_ monsters with &#34;immune to all&#34;, so that the only 
&#62; &#62; tactic available is &#34;stone and beat up&#34; or &#34;stone, golem 
&#62; &#62; and beat up&#34;. But how you could do this when the mage does only 
&#62; &#62; about say 40-50 damage/hit (with a _really_ good weapon - not with 
&#62; &#62; the dreamflange most seem to use) was beyond me until some days ago. 
&#62; &#62; I met a player who is a real mage fanatic and I asked him how he was 
&#62; &#62; able to do hell/hell alone. He said &#34;well, of course these 
&#62; &#62; monsters are a problem. So I don't even bother killing them, but 
&#62; &#62; instead I teleport around, looking for the stairs down, so I can skip 
&#62; &#62; the level&#34;. So much for doing hell/hell alone. When I talk about 
&#62; &#62; &#34;doing hell/hell&#34; I mean of course &#34;killing all the 
&#62; &#62; monsters and getting all the items&#34;. Apparently, the mage cannot 
&#62; &#62; do that - or, if you try it, it takes a _really_ long time (stoning 
&#62; &#62; everybody, hitting one of them for about twenty to fourty times till 
&#62; &#62; he dies, stoning everybody again, beating up the next one, ...). 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 3. When rating the classes after their capabilities for co-op play, 
&#62; &#62; the warrior stands out again - because he simply cannot do 
&#62; &#62; &#34;friendly fire&#34;. I have met only one or two mages who were 
&#62; &#62; fun to play with. All others enter the dungeon and set their chain 
&#62; &#62; lightning switch to &#34;on&#34;, not bothering that their warrior 
&#62; &#62; friends drop dead around them. Or, worse, they wait until the warrior 
&#62; &#62; goes hand-to-hand with a knight, then they start &#34;helping&#34; 
&#62; &#62; with fireballs. The few mages who were OK either went their own way 
&#62; &#62; or they stood there, stoning everybody in sight. Both isn't the kind 
&#62; &#62; of cooperation which is the most fun ... Rogues sometimes are really 
&#62; &#62; OK to play with, but only if the player is very experienced and knows 
&#62; &#62; _where_ he should shoot and _when_. Otherwise rogues can be really 
&#62; &#62; annoying. Warriors on the other hand are _always_ OK to play with - 
&#62; &#62; except when it's a cheater who takes away all the monsters.
&#62; &#62; The games on battle.net which I remember as the best were always 
&#62; &#62; games where all players had a warrior as their character.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; just my 0.02.  -  I know that most battle.net - players seem to 
&#62; &#62; prefer mages (at least I get this impression when I follow the 
&#62; &#62; threads), but I really never understood WHY. Maybe somebody can 
&#62; &#62; explain it to me - I am really interested.
&#62;   I would like to know how to use the shrine on the first hit it witn 
&#62; my sword and nothing seems to happen what is up? can anybody give me 
&#62; a hint?

all u have to do to use a shrine is when it is highlighted click on 
it and u will walk to it and use it.  don't hold shift cuz u can't 
attack them.</pre>
