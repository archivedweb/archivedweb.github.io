<pre>I've probably thought about this issue way more than
its importance warrants, and everyone in this Forum
is either fed up with &#34;cheating&#34; threads, or disagrees
with me .... so here goes nothing!

This started for me with Code Myster's survey on whether
or not certain actions were &#34;cheating&#34;. Now it may or may not
be particularly important to decide what is or isn't  
&#34;cheating&#34;, but
looking at his list, I thought that none of his items were very
problematic (excluding one that seems to involve a bug in the
Nova spell, which I know nothing about). Most of them concerned
actions entirely possible within the game, like shopping, or giving
legit items to lower level players etc. Now, you could discuss
the ethics of these quite a bit, but they're not &#34;cheating&#34;. 
Three of
the items concerned the use of a third party Diablo program to
do things not permitted by Blizzard's program (Deye to look at
people's stats  in chat, TownKill to teleport around town, and
a Diablo backup program to back up your character in the event
of a hard drive crash). So those are obviously &#34;cheating&#34;, 
right?

Wrong! I was in a tiny minority (close to one) with the opinion that
character backup is cheating. So I had to really re-examine my
opinion on that one. The most substantial argument against backup
being &#34;cheating&#34; was put forward by Aahz and Zamp: they 
pointed
out that Bliz had given instructions on how to backup and restore
characters a while back in the Technical Support Forum (copy this
file there and that one here ... I don't claim to know any details).

I believe Bliz did this pretty surreptitiously --- &#34;psst! e-mail 
us and we'll
tell you how&#34; --- I don't recall seeing a posted explanation, but 
someone
can correct me if I'm wrong about that. They did this, I believe, 
because
they decided a number of people had justifiable complaints about
losing characters due to system crashes, changes in machine name,
etc., and they've done their best to take care of  Diablo customers
in often difficult circumstances.

Aahz further pointed out that Lambert's DiabloBackup.exe utility, if
used just to back up your character, did nothing more or less than
transfer files as instructed by Bliz, so if using DiabloBackup.exe was
&#34;cheating&#34;, then following Bliz's instructions was also 
&#34;cheating&#34;.
The logic is impeccable.

My take on this is that it is &#34;cheating&#34; and that Bliz has 
been providing a
little friendly advice through Tech Forum on how to hack Diablo. (Who
better to give it?) The fact that the instructions come from Bliz, 
rather
than Code Mysters web page, for example, doesn't make it any less
of a hack.

Now why is Bliz in the absurd situation of telling us how to hack 
their
own program? Well, I think the explanation is an interesting 
observation of
Zamp's, that Diablo began as a single-player game. The multi-player,
battle.net part is a whole separate half that was crammed on top, and
it doesn't always coexist very peacefully with the single-player
part. If Diablo had been designed as a multi-player game from the 
ground
up (like UO, say), then Bliz could have kept the character data on 
their
servers. They would be responsible for ensuring proper backup of the
data, and none of these problems would arise. But, because of the
single-player aspect, the data is on our hard-drives. Bliz couldn't 
add
a multi-player backup feature to the game because of all the potential
abuses which they feared it would be put to. A lot of people never 
liked
this (in many cases -- not all -- because they didn't want to lose 
their
stuff, not because they were worried about a system crash).  So Enigma
wrote his trainer for a friend to back up his character. The trainer 
had
many unintended side-effect, and Bliz's worst fears were more than
realized.
