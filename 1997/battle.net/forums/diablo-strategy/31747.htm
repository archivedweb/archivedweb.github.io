&#62;    I have been playing a rogue for months now( my favorite char) and 
&#62; for the life of me I cannot figure out how to have a good coop game 
&#62; with a warior. Most wariors storm right in activating way too many 
&#62; monsters at 1 time. If I lead and take a position agains a wall, to 
&#62; pick off witches as soon as they pop up their ugly heads, the warior 
&#62; always stepps right into my flight path. Now I'm turning him into a 
&#62; pincushon and he's pissed at me! I am the farthest thing from a pk 
&#62; and accidental deathes bother me big time.
&#62;    Granted I usually am playing with the gpow crew, they are nice but 
&#62; they make my life so dam hard. I want to inch in and they want to 
&#62; storm through.
&#62;    I have had the good fortune of meeting a couple of wariors that 
&#62; are legit and fun to play with. When I retreat they retreat.
&#62;    I guess my question is if the dummy steps into my line of active 
&#62; fire should I just keep fireing till he moves or drops? Or should I 
&#62; just back off while he's activating way too many monsters at the same 
&#62; time?

I am a Warrior myself and love getting in to a room full of thousands 
of demons, letting them soround me then .....  kick their ass. BUT 
thats only if I am in a game with warriors or if no rougues are 
around. If you get cheesed off with a warrior doing all the work 
while you sit and watch, tell him, say 'Gonna leave some for me?!' or 
'Sure, I love to watch...'. This might get the guy pissed off but 
then its not worth playing with him, normally he should back away and 
you should end up fighting back to back (thats when it gets fun). 
Keep looking in games for a good team to play with, dont just give up 
on warriors. I love playing with rogues, its better then playing with 
mages as most of them use the damn AAA staff witch kills ya when your 
up close fighting. Also make sure you dont kill anyone, once you've 
hit the guy once or twice accidently, STOP. Otherwise no-one will 
want to play with ya.
