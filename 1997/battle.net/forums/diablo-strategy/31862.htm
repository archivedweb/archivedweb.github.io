&#62; Now to the Mage: I never 
&#62; understood how a mage could survive hell/hell alone - after all, 
&#62; there _are_ monsters with &#34;immune to all&#34;, so that the only 
&#62; tactic available is &#34;stone and beat up&#34; or &#34;stone, golem 
&#62; and beat up&#34;. But how you could do this when the mage does only 
&#62; about say 40-50 damage/hit (with a _really_ good weapon - not with 
&#62; the dreamflange most seem to use) was beyond me until some days ago. 
&#62; I met a player who is a real mage fanatic and I asked him how he was 
&#62; able to do hell/hell alone. He said &#34;well, of course these 
&#62; monsters are a problem. So I don't even bother killing them, but 
&#62; instead I teleport around, looking for the stairs down, so I canskip 
&#62; the level&#34;. So much for doing hell/hell alone. When I talk about 
&#62; &#34;doing hell/hell&#34; I mean of course &#34;killing all the 
&#62; monsters and getting all the items&#34;. Apparently, the mage cannot 
&#62; do that - or, if you try it, it takes a _really_ long time (stoning 
&#62; everybody, hitting one of them for about twenty to fourty times till 
&#62; he dies, stoning everybody again, beating up the next one, ...).

Varaya,

A skilled mage is absolutely capable of doing hell/hell alone.  I 
have played there with my lvl 19 mage alone many times.  It's not as 
hard as you might think for several reasons.

Levels 13 and 14 rarely have &#34;immune to all&#34; monsters.  
Technically, this is hell/hell, though.  Occasionally, you'll get a 
seed with soul burners.  (Man, I hate them.)  In this event, I 
confess, I usually start a new game to get a better seed.  :)

In fact, rarely is level 15 filled with &#34;immune to all&#34; 
monsters.  The first time you usually encounter these pesky immunes 
is in Laz's chamber.  Remember, no monster in Diablo is immune to 
Apocalypse.  My Bountiful staff of Apoc easily clears that room of 
everyone except Laz, by just standing outside the walls and casting.  
As for Laz, take him out with a few stone curses, a golem, and my 
King's sword of the Heavens.

Level 16 is where you really run into the trouble as a mage.  In my 
experience, everyone there is immune to all.  For this reason, I 
usually restrict my hell/hell runs to levels 13-15.  You're right, it 
does take a while to clear 16, but it can be done.  My tools ... 
Bountiful staff of Apoc, Golem, Stone Curse, my 
KSOHeavens/Stormshield.  My technique ... draw out a few knights at a 
time by Sending in the golem.  Break the golem before he brings too 
many, though.  Retreat a little via teleport, and stone them all.  
Cast golem, and get in there and help him hack.  If things start to 
look bad, for instance, if you have too many knights at a time, just 
quickly stone, and grab that Apoc staff.  The counselors are for the 
most part stationary.  That is, they won't follow you around corners. 
 Is also seems, that, if you don't activate them first, they cannot 
target a golem with their fireballs.  The golem is immune to flash, 
so he really makes short order of them.  Another thing ... never 
throw switches.  Use infravision if you can, or just Apoc across 
walls, and then teleport in.  

I got my third dot all by myself using these techniques.  :)  I'll 
give you that the going is slow.  And have to make a lot of trips to 
town to recharge that staff.  To be honest, it is so slow that I've 
never completely cleared 16.  Seems like a waste of time.  I went 
straight to the Big Guy to get my third dot.  But, I'm waying it 
could be done, and remember, we're just talking about lvl 16 here.  I 
have done 13-15 many times ... easily.

The mage is my favorite character.  This post is already getting long 
enough, so I'll make my reasons short.  He has more raw damage power 
than any other character (upper level fireballs rock!).  Given the 
right jewelry, he can wear any armor in the game, and have a good AC. 
 My Royal Circlet, Awesome field plate, and Stormshield give me good 
protection.  And finally, I like the complexity of strategy involved 
in using the right spell for the right situation.  With such a vast 
spell arsenal, and so much mana, you can really have a lot of fun.  

Anyway, I hope the hell/hell info was helpful.
