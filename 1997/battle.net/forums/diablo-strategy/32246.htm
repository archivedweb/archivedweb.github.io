<pre>  OK, since the subject came up a couple of messages down, I thought 
I'd toss in my nickel's worth.

  Warriors tend to have one defining feature that is a drawback in 
single player, but counts as a perq in multiplayer. They have little 
reason or talent for the use of long range attacks. If a warrior does 
what he is best at, he will never endanger his teammates directly.
However, here are a few &#34;fine points&#34; I have discovered over 
time.

   (1) Do not run off ahead of everybody else. First off, you're 
leaving your support behind, and that's bad tactics. Second, it makes 
you look greedy, like you want to get all the best kills. Third, if 
you activate more monsters than *you* can handle, you can believe the 
sorcerer or rogue behind you won't know what hit them.

   (2) Be aware of the sorcerer/rogue. Know where they are, know if 
they are getting swarmed. A stun-lagged sorcerer is a terrible thing 
to taste. Rogues are a little better at taking care of themselves in 
a press, but they need support badly if baddies reach hand-to-hand 
range. It is your duty to cover your allies.

   (3) Some people say it is the caster/shooter's responsibility to 
not shoot you in the back. All well and good, but I'm not going to 
just *trust* the other driver not to run the redlight. So to speak. 
If you actively try to *stay* *out* *of* *the* *way* not only will 
you get hit less, the baddies will get hit more. On a side note, take 
care when engaging black knights and blood knights in combat. A 
warrior in plate mail looks very similar to these monsters to someone 
with an itchy bowstring. Or mana ball.

   (4) Target aquisition. Always try to pick the targets that will 
give your teammates the most trouble. If you take on the balrogs, 
stormlords, knights, whatever this leaves your ranged attack buddy 
free to deal with the b/witches and advocate-kin. By the way, has 
anybody noticed that the evil wizard baddies are all named after old-
style terms for lawyers? Advocate, Magistrate, ect.

  These are pretty basic tactics. Anybody want to add some?
