<pre>Code,

      Try to take a mage with only resist ring and amulet, then 
equipe as many mana as possible and go down to hell.  It's great and 
fun too. I have done entire hell/hell with 2 obs(40&#37;) and lots of 
mana potions.  And if you want post time and date, I'll meet you 
anywhere as long as you want to go in naked.  :p

                Lestat, lost and confused.

&#62; I believe would be easy for me and my Rogue char, to clear Hell Hell 
&#62; by myself, WITHOUT armor! Hmmm maybe easy wasn't the correct choice 
&#62; of words.... but I think Armor really can be irrelevant in a Hell 
&#62; Hell quest.
&#62; 
&#62; I would restrict myself to: Bow, Amulet and 2 rings (potions and 
&#62; scrolls to of course). No extra cheats, items etc would be used.
&#62; 
&#62; I would like to attempt this with someone to see &#34;if&#34; it's 
&#62; possible or at least, how far someone can get. Sound interesting? 
&#62; Pure raw experience is nearly all you can count on. I will experiment 
&#62; with this a little tonight. 
&#62; 
&#62; At minimum I would like at least someone to tag along to 
&#62; &#34;verify&#34; how I do (I would agree at any time for the 
&#62; &#34;referee&#34; to say &#34;check&#34; or something and I would 
&#62; allow myself to get killed to verify no cheats or godmode).
&#62; 
&#62; I got thinking about this last night and for a challenge, would love 
&#62; to try it. I think Diablo would be hard and be time consuming as you 
&#62; can't hide from his apoc spell. Hmmmmm interesting!
