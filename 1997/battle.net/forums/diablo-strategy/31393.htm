There are many clans that would fit what you are looking for but 
here's info on the one I joined.

Everyone in this guild is very against cheating of any kind.  There 
are lots of people in the guild, at last count, 583, so there's 
usually no problem finding someone to play with, especially around 
your level (one thing that's been emphasized lately is that we play 
with people around our level, to avoid creating a situation where a 
level say 5 guy goes in with a Level 30 guy and goes behind him 
picking up stuff he didn't earn and really shouldn't have at his 
level.  I think everyone who plays legit knows that eventually that 
level 5 player is gonna be bored.)  Anyway there's a lot of nice 
people, you can check out the guild Moltenlava at www.moltenlava.com 
and you can fill out an application there if you wish.  Our leader is 
named Lavawalker.  If you have any questions, you can reply back to 
this post and I'll answer best I can.

You don't have to submit stats or spells or anything, just fill out 
the application that has some basic questions.  Some people on the 
channel periodically check with a program people's basic stats to see 
if they have normal stats or if they are cheaters.  I regularly see 
people come in our channel wanting to join, saying they are legit and 
I look and they have 214 BILLION gold peices.  This is the amount 
every cheater that turns on the unlimited gold cheat has.  I 
regularly check someone out if I don't know them cause I personally 
don't want to play with a cheater.

&#62; I'm a totally legit level 30 warrior looking to join a clan.  Anyone 
&#62; wanting any other information
&#62; about me, such as stats, eq, spells, or if you have a place open in 
&#62; your clan, send me an email.
&#62; thanks,
&#62;
