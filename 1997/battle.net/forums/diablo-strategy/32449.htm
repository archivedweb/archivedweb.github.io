&#62;  Ok...I may seem a little obsessed here, but I can't let it die, so 
&#62; here we go. 
&#62;  
&#62;  Godly Full Plate CAN be purchased.
&#62; 
&#62;  Kalibos (the first) wears Godly Full Plate of the Ages (yeah, I 
&#62; know, it's probably duped...I didn't know at the time I traded for it 
&#62; and am working on fixing that...).  I went to Gris to see how much it 
&#62; sells for-he offered 42511 gold, which translates into a buying price 
&#62; of 170044 gold.  Now, seeing that one can only carry 170k without 
&#62; filling the last six slots, this armor would be unbuyable.  However, 
&#62; it is over by only 44 gold, which seems like it would be easy to 
&#62; whack off the end without a problem (meaning gris is being generous). 
&#62;  
&#62;  Kalibos went to a few games looking for plate.  I found a suit of 
&#62; Full Plate of the Ages at Griswold in one, and he was asking 33100 
&#62; gold for it.  
&#62;  I then started a game with Aelia, a level 32 rogue.  I found a suit 
&#62; of magical full plate in normal hell.  I tried to sell it before it 
&#62; was ID'd (damn good thing I kept it, it turned out to be Saintly 
&#62; Plate of the Stars, +129, +10 all!), and he was going to give me 1625 
&#62; gold, which means that Magical Full Plate of nothing would sell for 
&#62; 6500 gold.  
&#62;  Here comes the assumptions I made-  
&#62; 
&#62; Godly Full Plate of the Ages sells for 170044
&#62; Full Plate sells for 6500
&#62; Full Plate of the Ages sells for 33100
&#62; The Ages suffix on Full Plate adds 26600 to the price
&#62; 
&#62; ergo, Godly Full Plate of nothing would sell for 143444 gold, which 
&#62; is well into the realm of affordable.
&#62; 
&#62; Please reply if you have contradictory evidence

The problem is Kalibos, is that you can't *buy* a godly plate from 
Griz, you can only buy them from Wirt!!  And as we all know Wirt 
charges a hell of a lot more than Griz for the same gear.  Therefore, 
my feeling is that you can't buy GP.
