&#62; &#62; pushy sorry it's my nature : )  Just really like to play with good 
&#62; &#62; rogues that don't outclass me (lvl 40 for example). Im on the west 
&#62; &#62; coast and I play at night  , cause my family is sleeping.
&#62; &#62;   Does anybody else have a family that doesn't understand to leave 
&#62; &#62; you alone when your running for your life in hell?
&#62; &#62;   Anyway my offer for a game is a standing offer. Anytime I can have 
&#62; &#62; a game I'll play.

&#62; Violence, 
&#62; 
&#62;        that would be cool, I'm in the mood to push the envolope and 
&#62; take this charachter for her first trip into hell. If you want to, 
&#62; i'll be in channel adh in about 5 minutes :) and I could use a higher 
&#62; level charachter along to watch over me, because I don't have much 
&#62; resistance yet, and this charachter isn't immune to death in normal 
&#62; hell, yet anyways :)

     I dunno, Ken... You did pretty well last night (this morning?) 
if that was your first trip to Hell! I mean, yeah Diablo killed you 3 
times, but 129 hp's at 22nd lvl? I think you need to start boosting 
the VIT.

     Anyway, just wanted to congratulate you on the dot, and to tell 
you and violence that I'm up for a game too, as long as I don't have 
to play a pincushion 8)

language, I have 10k for ya...</pre>
