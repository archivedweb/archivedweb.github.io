&#62;      Your post was very interesting, so I decided to try it out 
&#62; (hunting for jewelry).  I started a new game, put all my stuff in my 
&#62; backpack, quit, and started another game.  There I put my armor, 
&#62; shield, helm, and sword on but left the amulet and ring spaces empty. 
&#62;  I left the amulet and rings I had been wearing in my 'pack.  Cleared 
&#62; 1st lvl of Hell.  Found:
&#62; 
&#62;           Jade Ring (+24&#37; resist all)
&#62;           Gold Bastard Sword of Sorcery (+23&#37; tohit, +19 Magic)
&#62;           Shrt Bow of the Stars (+8 all attributes)
&#62;           Obsidian Longsword (+32&#37; resist all)
&#62; 
&#62;      Now, though this is a step up in quality from the jumk i'm used 
&#62; to finding as a 27th lvl Warrior, I had been hoping for more jewelry. 
&#62;  But it was a good experience in that it usually takes me 3 or 4 
&#62; games to find the weapons I found in 1 lvl!
&#62; 
&#62;      What I'm trying to say is this: Am I doing something wrong? When 
&#62; you said &#34;not wearing jewelry&#34; did you mean not in inv too?  
&#62; Just looking to improve on my mediocre equipment.
&#62; 
&#62;      Thanks in advance,
&#62;

Like I said in my little &#34;disclaimer&#34;, try several games! 
Trying it for a single game isn't enough to know if it will work or 
not for your char. Other things also affect &#34;drops&#34; such as 
DATES and TOD (time of day). This probibly will not work for 
everyone, but it does for me and, after seeing all the others posts, 
they are having/had success's.

As for someone meantioning finding weapons unsuited for your char, I 
have DEFINITLY noticed that at least with Wirt, he favors a warror 
for Helms and Armor, Adria favors Rogue for Staffs (I have now seen 
at least every AA there is for sale at Adria except for AA Rez). In 
game play, I find lots of staffs and Swords (last staff I found that 
I ID'd was an AA Chain :)... As I don't play the other char types 
enough, I can't verify what warriors and Sorcerers find regularly .

I guess this means Blizzard favors at least a Rogue, Warrior and a 
Sorcerer to be in each game and swap drops.

Damn my spelling is going downhill .... *sigh*</pre>
