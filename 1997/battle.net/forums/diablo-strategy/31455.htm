&#62; &#62; Boots,
&#62; &#62;    You poor bastard.  Why did you let all that stuff lay there?!?!  
&#62; &#62; That's a dragon's hoarde of ultra-rare treasure!  You should have 
&#62; &#62; read my post (I think it's on index 4 or 5 now...July 10 entitled 
&#62; &#62; ***TIRED OF LOSING YOUR STUFF?**** or something like that).  You 
&#62; &#62; could have had it all back......SIGH.  What a shame.  I have played 
&#62; &#62; for several months and haven't come up with items like that.  Oh 
&#62; &#62; well, maybe you will be lucky again.  Good luck in recovery mon ami.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; &#62; Saint Michael
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Jolly Ol' St. Mick,
&#62; Thanx for the quasi-sympathy.  I had read your post about losing the
&#62; stuff.  Unfortunately, there really was no way for me to impliment
&#62; any good recovery strategies.  As a warrior, I had neglected magic 
&#62; completely until about level 26 (now level 28), so I had no teleport
&#62; or phasing.  The first deaths (wife's and mine) occurred pretty close 
&#62; to the stairs.  I went down with my backup stuff on and tried to 
&#62; recover, but was killed even closer to the stairs.  By that time,
&#62; we had NO equipment, little money (about 10k, I think), and i had
&#62; no effective magic.  I went down naked a coupel times (only a belt
&#62; of potions), but the lava demons (or whatever they were specifically)
&#62; offed me before I could even drink the second one!!  I couldn't even
&#62; move through the horde to lure them away; if I had had a spell, I 
&#62; would never have been able to cast it (being a warrior and all).
&#62; 
&#62; We tried to go through the church and cats, in hopes of 
&#62; building/buying enough stuff for a last=ditch recovery effort.  
&#62; Unfortunately, on the last church level, my wife died, and i was 
&#62; about to (poor tactics--i went into a room, and couldn't withdraw-my 
&#62; computer said she was blocking the door, but hers said she was out of
&#62; the way--what a clusterf__k!!!).  In desperation, I quit  the game 
&#62; before I actually kicked off, in order to save the stuff I had 
&#62; accumulated to that point.
&#62; 
&#62; The moral of the story--it really is just a game.  I look forward to 
&#62; trying a normal hell run with crappy stuff, trying to build up our
&#62; arsenal again!!  (although, I'd rather have kept the stuff . . .THREE
&#62; ZODIACS, man--two with suffixes!!!)
&#62; 
&#62; If you're interested, I'll let you know what I get.  If I get some 
&#62; good stuff, I'll keep it for trade?  (dont' worry--i usually play
&#62; direct connect, and I have never duped, so me and my wife are 
&#62; 150&#37; legit).
&#62; 
&#62; A sad, but determined, Boots

Sorry Boots,

I know you can defend yourself. I didn't see your other post here
when I started to compose my other message on this thread. I
probably should have refreshed my browser before I started composing.
Anyway, I had a feeling that the situation wasn't as easily
remedied as Saint Michael suggested.
