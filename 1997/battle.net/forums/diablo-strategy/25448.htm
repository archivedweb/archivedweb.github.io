&#62; &#62; I just earned my second dot on a solo mission.  But I'm curious if 
&#62; &#62; someone has some useful input for me.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; First, I launched about 10 flame waves into Diablo's lair.  After 
&#62; &#62; dodging his sewage and doing the stone curse/fireball thing on all of 
&#62; &#62; the pursuant knights, it was just me and Diablo.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I laid no less than 20 bone spirits (I went down with 35 mana 
&#62; &#62; potions) 
&#62; &#62; and 15 fireballs (hits; I must have fired off about 30 total) before 
&#62; &#62; he bit it.  With 15th level flame wave (min 210 damage) and fireball 
&#62; &#62; (min 400ish damage), add in 20 bone spirits. . .  You do the math.  
&#62; &#62; That's a spicy meatball!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I know that Diablo has resistance to this, that and the other.  So 
&#62; &#62; here are my questions:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1.  If you &#34;resist&#34; something, does it reduce the amount of 
&#62; &#62; damaged caused, or do you simply take no damage x&#37; of the time?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2.  Does Diablo have a set amount of hit points?  Does anybody know 
&#62; &#62; what the total is?  Does anybody know what kind of calculations are 
&#62; &#62; used to figure his hit points?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Any help is appreciated.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; 
&#62; Well, Gutman, Diablo has well over 850 hit points. That's a LOT.... 
&#62; I'm not too surprised it took so many spells to kill him. His 
&#62; resistance must be quite high.
&#62; But as for the calculations to figure it out... don't ask me.
&#62; 
&#62; And the resistance part... I don't know about that either.
&#62; 
&#62; Hope I helped you a bit, anyway.

Someone actually killed Diablo 30+ times just to find out his
hit points in normal, nightmare, and hell modes.  I forgot the
site, but I think Fire Made Flesh posted it.  Anyway, normal,
he has 1666 hit pts, nightmare 5000+ and hell 6000+.  If he's
immune to a certain type of spell, then there is no hope with
that spell to do even a slight damage.  Resistance means that
the spell can do only 25&#37; damage of what it states.  Try to 
kill him with holy bolt, it'll will stun him, eventhough it doesn't
do as much damage as fireball.  Also, he's immune to bone spirit,
and flame wave doesn't seem to do the damage as it professes.
