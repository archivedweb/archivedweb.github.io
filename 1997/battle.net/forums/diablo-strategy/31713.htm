&#62; Before responding, I want to make clear that I define 
&#62; &#34;cheating&#34; as the use or exploitation of external 
&#62; programs/hacks or internal bugs/anomalies in a way that is contrary 
&#62; to the intentions, structure, limitations, or restrictions of the 
&#62; game as created and designed by the game's designers or creators.
&#62; 
&#62; I also do not consider &#34;cheating&#34; to be automatically bad or 
&#62; good, or right or wrong.  But then, there is gaming behavior that 
&#62; some people consider &#34;bad&#34; or &#34;wrong&#34; that is not 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; With that in mind . . . 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
&#62; 
&#62; No, as long as the gold is not duped.  Trading gold (and other items) 
&#62; is a game function.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?
&#62; 
&#62; No, as long as the items are not duped.  Trading items (like gold) is 
&#62; a game function.  Blizzard placed no restriction on intercharacter 
&#62; trading.  The only restriction placed on low level characters' use of 
&#62; items is the stat requirement for that item (there is no level 
&#62; requirement, as there is for game difficulty).
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  This is actually just trading/accepting items (the previous 
&#62; question) with the source of the item specified.  It makes no 
&#62; difference whether the higher level char. found, bought, or traded 
&#62; for the item, as long as it's legit.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; &#62; elixers?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  This is actually just trading/accepting items (question 2) with 
&#62; a particular item specified.  It makes no difference what the item 
&#62; is, as long as it's not duped.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  Cheating really doesn't depend on the relative levels of the 
&#62; players involved.  Is it cheating for a lower level player to clear a 
&#62; level while a higher level clears another (or sits in town)? Or what 
&#62; about two characters of the same level?  Of course not.  
&#62; Incidentally, it's hard to see what benefit the lower level player 
&#62; gains from this, since they don't gain XP.  Going into the level and 
&#62; picking up gold and items?  But this is effectively the same as if 
&#62; the higher level player picked up the items and gold and gave them to 
&#62; the lower level player in town, which isn't cheating.  This just 
&#62; removes the higher level player as the middle-man.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?
&#62; 
&#62; No, because starting new games is part of the game design.  Your 
&#62; intent in starting the game doesn't matter.  (If you think that this 
&#62; is cheating, where do you draw the line?  How much of the game must 
&#62; you play before it wouldn't be considered cheating?  All of it?  What 
&#62; about characters who can handle the Church or Cats, but not the Caves 
&#62; or Hell?  Are they cheating by clearing only the Church or Cats?  And 
&#62; what about people who do &#34;Laz runs&#34;?  Are they cheating by 
&#62; starting games only with the intent of doing a Laz run?)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
&#62; 
&#62; Technically yes, because an external program is being used inside the 
&#62; game to gain information that you otherwise would not be able to gain 
&#62; inside the game using normal game functions.  That's not to say its 
&#62; use is good or bad, however, since its use may be justified in some 
&#62; cases.  But it is &#34;cheating.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; &#62; could not regularly access?
&#62; 
&#62; No, because town portals are part of the game design, and the game 
&#62; design does not prevent lower level characters from entering portals 
&#62; to these areas (compare with Blizzard preventing lower level 
&#62; characters from entering higher difficulty games).  Unless this has 
&#62; been identified as a &#34;bug&#34; like duping, it is not cheating.  
&#62; (As far as I am concerned, if a lower level character wants to risk 
&#62; their items by taking on a very difficult level, good luck!).
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  Creating characters is a legitimate game function, and as 
&#62; discussed above, giving items from one character to another is part 
&#62; of the game design.  Intent again is irrelevant in this case.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  If it's not cheating to transfer items under question 2 above, 
&#62; it isn't cheating to transfer items between characters created by the 
&#62; same person.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  No more so than PKing by any other method can be considered 
&#62; cheating.  Nova is a legitimate spell in the game.  (Note that 
&#62; duelists can agree to a &#34;Code Duello&#34; that establishs any 
&#62; restrictions they desire, and a violation of those rules could be 
&#62; considered cheating, although not as I defined it above.)
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  See previous answer.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
&#62; 
&#62; Yes, because to do so requires the use of an external program that 
&#62; allows you to do something in the game that is not part of the game 
&#62; design.  Whether the time you save by teleporting in town makes this 
&#62; &#34;cheat&#34; a &#34;bad&#34; or &#34;harmless&#34; cheat is 
&#62; another question.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
&#62; 
&#62; No.  This is one of the cases where the intent of the user makes a 
&#62; difference because it involves the use of an external program. While 
&#62; the use of an external program allows you to save char data, using it 
&#62; to combat against external problems or events (like a system crash) 
&#62; does not accomplish something contrary to the intent or design of the 
&#62; game.  I believe that this is apparent from Blizzard's help to people 
&#62; in saving and transferring character data.  As long as the intent and 
&#62; result are the same, whether you follow Blizzard's instructions 
&#62; (which are NOT part of the game, by the way) or use a hack program 
&#62; should make no difference.
