&#62; Based upon your screenshots, the rogue has a LOT more light radius 
&#62; than the mage.  This must be because Dexterity boosts light radius 
&#62; along with the other things like &#37; to hit, AC, etc.
&#62; 
&#62; I say this because I (my mage) was using Nightscape (Unique Armor) 
&#62; and Gotterdamerung, both of which give -40&#37; to light radius (-
&#62; 80&#37; total). Only the 1 square I was standing on was fully lit, 
&#62; and the 8 squares that surround that 1 square were 1/2 lit.  Nothing 
&#62; else was lit.  On your screenshots, however, You have an ADDITIONAL 
&#62; set of squares which are partially lit up (they are lit about the 
&#62; same as the 1st ring for the mage).  So, using the darkness trick 
&#62; might be better for the mage or warrior, since the +250 dex is a 
&#62; detriment to the rogue for this particular case.
&#62; 
&#62; So, does this mean that BNET will now be flooded with dupes of 
&#62; Nightscape and Rings of Darkness?  THAT would be cool, Nightscape 
&#62; replacing GPOW as the armor of choice!!!   :)
&#62; 
&#62; Artemis II
&#62; Cant wait to get home to experiment some more with this


No. You are reading a little bit to far in this. I complement you 
though on noticing the &#34;extra&#34; lit up squares. Dex has 
nothing to do with the light radius.

The answer is simple, I used 2 rings of darkness. They are not full -
40&#37; rings! I forget the exact stats on them, but I think I have 
like -60 to -70&#37; light, not the full -80&#37; you experienced. On 
a side note, I AM looking for better Darkness rings (remember 
everyone, I collect the -ALL stuff like trouble etc.)

I guess hunting for a full -40&#37; ring of Dark is like finding a 
full +20 Zod. &#60;g&#62;

Later,

                               -=/ Code Myster /=-


PS: I find it very funny to think of everyone that will be hunting in 
the cats tonight to find Rings of Darkness (I have found all mine 
there). hehehehehe</pre>
