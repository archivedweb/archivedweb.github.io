<pre>Hi!

I'm so glad you joined!  I looked for your name on the members list a 
couple of times cause I saw your post on our Discussion Group page 
but I didn't know to look for a different name.  Last night there 
were not a lot of people in the main channel because there was a 
tournament going on in a different channel.  That's were I was 
between 9p.m. and 11p.m. EST watching the tournament (through my 
husband's character, Ironsamson, who was one of the people running 
the tournament).  That was kind of fun to watch.  Everyone probably 
went back to the main channel around 11:45 after the tournament.

I should be getting on the Molten lava channel tonight between 9:30 
p.m. and 10 p.m.  I could answer any questions you have, you can 
whisper me if you don't want to &#34;talk out loud&#34;.  

I agree that the guild is has a lot of organizational structure that 
to some people is not necessary, but believe me, I checked out other 
guilds when I was deciding on one and some have no structure and you 
can't find on their page (if you can find their page in the first 
place) what they stand for, what they allow and don't allow, which is 
what I wanted to know.</pre>
