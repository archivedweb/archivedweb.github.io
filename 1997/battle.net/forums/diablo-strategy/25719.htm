&#62; Eaglehorn is an excellent bow.  I use it most often, even in 
&#62; Nightmare /Hell and Hell/Hell.
&#62; 
&#62; I also have Windforce, which is also excellent, partly because it 
&#62; just does more damage than Eaglehorn and it knocks-back monsters.
&#62; 
&#62; I just finished Hell/Hell the other night.  I used Windforce most of 
&#62; the time, and it's knock-back feature allowed me to stay alive when 
&#62; fighting the Steel Lords on 16.  If I was using the Eaglehorn, I 
&#62; would have died.
&#62; 
&#62; However, I died once when fighting Diablo, because he would get 
&#62; knocked back and then hit me again with apocalypse.  So, after I 
&#62; restarted in town, I switched to the Eaglehorn and went back down 
&#62; after Diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; The Eaglehorn worked great!!  I was able to hit Diablo repeatedly 
&#62; without him even getting a chance to hit me back once.  He just 
&#62; stayed in one spot as arrow after arrow sank home, quivering with 
&#62; each hit.
&#62; 
&#62; I then developed a new respect for my Eaglehorn--it may not do the 
&#62; damage of some bows, but the monsters can't hit you if you're hitting 
&#62; them, and the Eaglehorn does the job, even if you have to fire a few 
&#62; more arrows than the Windforce.  

Personally, I like to use my Merciless Bow of the Heavens.  The best
bow of Diablo varies: ask 100 Rouges and get 100 very different 
answers.  I'd say that you should find a bow (or two) that you like
and that keep the monsters off of you (either by knockback or by
killing them first) and use it/them, no matter what they are, as long 
as you like and are happy with it/them.
