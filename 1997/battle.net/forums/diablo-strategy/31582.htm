<pre>To all of you out there,this is just my theory of how the first legit 
GPOW is found.Now all of us know that in multiplayer mode there are 
only 4 quests.And so if u want to get a good item,it must be from 
either a)chests or b)from dead creatures,am i right?What i'm trying 
to say is that :do u guys remember a room in hell which has a lot of 
weapons and good armors?Seems familiar? The room is where LORD OF THE 
BLOOD is situated.Of course ,that quest only happens in single player 
games.Perhaps some one killed LOTB and by chance GPOW is one of the 
armor in the room?I remember getting a lot of full plate at that 
place.Perhaps that guy save GPOW (ie:hacked) in his &#34;item 
directory&#34; and then brought it onto B.NET?I think that is a high 
possibility because i can't remember any other place which provides a 
lot of goodies as much as the LOTB's room.If u guys notice ,there's 
this debate in the forum which says that getting GPOW legitly is 1 in 
a million, and that it is also would be too expensive to buy(if u 
know how to calculate).And so ,as i keep mentioning,PERHAPS my theory 
is right. I dunno what u guys may think but i would like to have your 
opinions.Or maybe u guys wouldn't even care less about this 
article.Just to tell what i feel that's all.

                                                    Yours sincerely,
                                                      Canto          </pre>
