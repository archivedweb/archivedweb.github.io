<pre>     I know exactly how you feel, Violence.  When I first started 
playing, it was Sorcerors and Rogues: leave the dredgework to the 
thugs.  And besides, all the Warriors I met were brutes that relied 
on their equipment to pull them through.  After wondering why they 
played this way, I started &#60;gasp&#62; a Warrior!  And I haven't 
looked back.

     The Warrior has become my personal favorite class, although I 
still occasionally play Rogues and Sorcerors.  The reason is this: 
While mages, for the most part, don't have to worry about tactics 
(teleport in and CL everything that moves), and Rogues always get 
pigeonholed into using bows (which I'm not very good with), the 
Warrior HAS to think his way through fights (unless you're with the 
GPOW crew).  Because if you don't, you become confetti.

     And before I get into the &#34;Warriors don't know how to 
play&#34; paragraph, let me say this: I have also met Rogues and 
Mages that &#34;can't play&#34;.  I've seen lvl 4 Rogues rush at the 
Butcher with a shortsword and shield and wonder why they died.  I've 
seen Sorcerors with bows go up against Diablo (that one was funny).  
So the Warrior is not the only class that people can't seem to get 
the hang of.

     But you are right, many people CAN'T play Warriors.  I think 
some can't because as newbies they were given all their equipment, 
and so always relied on it (until it fails them).  Others, however, 
have no excuse.  Most of the Warriors I meet in public games these 
days are either jack@$$es or stupid.  An example:

          I started a public game, called it &#34;Legits Only&#34; or 
something.  Went down to Hell and began to rack up the experience.  
After about 5 minutes &#34;John Dough&#34; (generic name) entered the 
game and asked for a portal.  Fearing a PK, I got ready beforehand.  
He wasn't and so we decided to play together.  We walk down a 
hallway, and I peek into the room at the end.  About 4 dozen Soul 
Burners start shooting Blood Stars at me.  I retreat and tell him.  
He yells this &#34;Yeehaw!&#34; and runs into the room.  HE HAD CHAIN 
ARMOR ON!  I wasn't about to die for a lost cause, so I stood back 
and watched him die. Didn't like it, but I wasn't about to die to 
save his butt.

     So, Violence, in conclusion I would say it depends on who you're 
playing with.  I don't consider myself a REALLY good player (ie: of 
DS's or Code's caliber) but my freinds tell me I play well.  I rarely 
run into the middle of a room, and when I do, I make sure I can 
survive the enseeing melee. I THINK. That is a Warrior's most 
valuable asset.

     Hope this clears up a few issues.
