&#62;         Cheating is defined, in my book, as doing anything that is 
&#62; not an INTENTIONAL part of the game. This means abviously that all 
&#62; hacks and trainers are cheating, as well as duping, because although 
&#62; it can be done within the game without the use of an external 
&#62; program, it wasn't placed there intentionally.

Sorry to disagree with you Kenwar, but that's really picking on
semantics.  If Blizzard's programmers had had 100 years to finish
the program, I'm sure they would've done a lot of things differently.
Trying to base the definition of cheating on what they intended to
do is a slippery thing at best.

My thinking is as follows:  It's a game.  It's meant for you to have
fun.  It's more fun not to cheat.  You wouldn't believe how stoked I
felt after finding Dreamflange and Windforce in a legit guild (AODH).
The identical finds would've been meaningless in a cheating
environment where everything is hacked and duped.  The difficulty
of finding stuff is what makes the find (and the game) all the more
satisfying.  By &#34;cheating&#34; you take away that satisfaction.  
Giving
high level items to low level characters, hacking super-items so
that there's no more point to finding anything, etc. all ruin the
fun so I consider them cheating.  After all, you're cheating
yourself out of what fun the game has to offer.

&#62;         Two things I don't see as cheating that I have seen listed 
&#62; here as cheating are, backing charachters up, and trading. First of 
&#62; all, I have seen this said a number of times, and I agree, Blizzard 
&#62; did not intend for system crashes and hd crashes to be a part of the 
&#62; game. I haven't actually used a backup program successfully yet (not 
&#62; for lack of trying)

Next time try using the transfer portion of DiabloBackup, not the
backup portion.  The backup program is (apparently) limited to the
same machine+machine name, so won't work if you change names/OSes/
hardware(?).  The transfer program doesn't have this limitation,
although it is a lot more work to use it (which is fine with me
since it reduces the temptation to use it to cheat).

And to those who think backing up is cheating:  If the power goes
out during the 4th quarter of game 7 of the NBA finals, do you expect
them to play the entire game over or pick up where they left off?
Please try to distinguish between external circumstances and
challenges built into the game.

&#62; but I do not think it is cheating. Second of all, I play in a legit 
&#62; league, with other legit players, then trading is not cheating, it is 
&#62; a way of life. If i find a dreamflange with my rogue, and my buddy 
&#62; the mage finds a windforce, you can believe we'll trade!

Heh.  That's what happened to me.  I felt kinda silly using
Dreamflange to read books.  :)  Sure was glad when Hugo (mage)
and I found Windforce in a game together.

&#62;        Now I realize that Darksniper is going to disagree with me on 
&#62; this one, but I also believe that recieving items from players well 
&#62; over your charachters level is another form of cheating, and is 
&#62; almost as bad as the rampant duping out there. In my guild we follow 
&#62; a 3 level trading rule, because otherwise the characther at the other 
&#62; end of the trade may be getting an item that is totally out of 
&#62; possibility for a charachter of his level to obtain legitimately. 

Actually, I've run into a couple problems with this rule.  When I
first started out at level 1, Hugo was level 12 and happened to be
in my first game (different dungeon) looking for a book of Mana
Shield and Town Portal.  Well, first book I found on level 1 of
the dungeon was Town Portal.  In fact, I end up finding four of
them in levels 1-4.  Not only that, I cleared level 4 and dropped
by town and Adria was selling a book of Mana Shield.

By your very clear reasoning above, it shouldn't be a problem for a
*lower* level character to offer an item to a higher level character
(out of good faith - I'd found 4 TP after all, and there was no way
I could afford the MS book at that level but I could've bought it
for Hugo).  But we checked with Sabrina and decided it'd be against
the rules for me (level 7 by that time) to help Hugo (level 13 by
that time).

The other time was when a level 28 player (names withheld since the
validity of this transaction is pending Flagstaff's ruling) needed a
book of Mana Shield.  A level 32 player ended up finding the book.
&#34;32&#34; sold it to a level 30 player who sold it to 
&#34;28&#34;.  It seems to
me that's circumventing the rules, but I can also see it as being
legit (trading being part of the game and all).  And it was only a
book of MS which as you'll recall Adria once offered to my level 7
character.

&#62; When the items a charachter is using far outclass the charachter, 
&#62; then the player is playing the item, not the charachter, and that is 
&#62; not the way the game was meant to be played.
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  what ruins the fun of the game.

&#62; the other one I 
&#62; despise is that the person can't win without them. That is bull, they 
&#62; just need a few more hours of practice, and they'll be able to handle 
&#62; the situation with little or no problem, and beyond that, Diablo is 
&#62; meant to be a challenge! if there was no challenge, there would be no 
&#62; fun!

I think you've hit another nail on the head.  The game is not only
about collecting items.  It's about collecting experience and
learning strategy.  Hugo and I were having a tough time on a level
with magistrates and snow witches.  He kept having to switch between
fireball and lightning and stone curse.  I (rogue) had 17&#37; 
lightning
resist and was getting the #$&#37;! beat out of me because the charged
bolts didn't register to my brain as a bigger threat than the dozen
blood stars that were coming straight at me.

After a couple rooms (and about 8 full mana potions :) of this, 
inspiration dawned and I told Hugo to fireball the witches and I'd
nail the magistrates.  We finished the level in no time.  A cheater
or PKer will never have the satisfaction of having thought up a key
piece of cooperative strategy like that.</pre>
