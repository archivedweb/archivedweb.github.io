&#62; Here are my opinions on cheating.  I appreciate any feedback that you 
&#62; may have to offer, so here goes:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.)  Altering your character in any way, by use of ecternal programs, 
&#62; or any other methods IS cheating.  (Example:  Raising exp, gold, 
&#62; stats, spell levels, adding items, adding spells, etc...)
&#62; 
&#62; 2.)  Backing up/restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating.  I 
&#62; am not going to use that old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse either.  
&#62; In single player Daiblo, when you get yer ass whupped up on by some 
&#62; demons, you can just restore from your last save, and multiplayer 
&#62; should be no different, especially with the added risks of pkillers, 
&#62; and the like.  Whilst I do agree that you must beware of such 
&#62; dangers, and protect yourself, that is not always enough, therefore, 
&#62; backups/restores, should be used to ensure your safety.
&#62; 
&#62; 3.)  In multiplayer games high-level players giving things to lower 
&#62; level players is legitimate ONLY if what is given to them is normally 
&#62; obtainable by the lower level character, for example, if a 20th level 
&#62; Rouge gives a few healing potions to a level 5 Warrior, that is fine, 
&#62; but giving something that the lower level character would not have 
&#62; access to until farther in the game IS cheating.  I am sick and tired 
&#62; of seeing low-level characters (level 1-12) having Godly plates, 
&#62; Obsidian rings, Dragon amulets, and King's swords.  These items are 
&#62; EXTREMELY rare, and are not legitimately found until much later in 
&#62; the game, not to mention that the vast majority of them are hacked 
&#62; anyway.  I am on Battle Net all of the time, and I see it every day, 
&#62; level 1-12 characters with the best equipment in the game, and it 
&#62; makes me sick, and almost want to go into convulsions every time I 
&#62; see it.
&#62; 
&#62; 4.)  Dupping IS cheating, under any circumstances.  If people didn't 
&#62; dupe, then the problem expressed in #3 above would not be so bad.  If 
&#62; King's swords, and other rare equipment, were as rare as they should 
&#62; be, they NOBODY would be giving them away.
&#62; 
&#62; 5.)  Using a program, such as one of the trainers that is out there, 
&#62; to grant immunity to other player's attacks is NOT cheating, unless 
&#62; participating in a duel, of coarse.  Reason being, with all of the 
&#62; PKers out there, one MUST protect oneself.  I know TONS of people 
&#62; disagree with this, but, it is an easy solution, to a BIG problem 
&#62; like PKers.
&#62; 
&#62; 6.)  Having other players buy items for you (from Griswald, Wirt, or 
&#62; Adria) is NOT cheating PROVIDING that they are the same level as you, 
&#62; or damn near the same level, and also providing that you have the 
&#62; required amount of gold.
&#62; 
&#62; 7.)  It is not cheating to re-start a game, just to see if Griswald, 
&#62; Wirt, or Adria have and rare items.
&#62; 
&#62; 8.)  It is NOT cheating to use programs that can show you other 
&#62; players stats.  If you are not cheating yourself, then you should 
&#62; have no reason why you would mind someone else viewing your stats, 
&#62; unless you are cheating, and have all 255, or something.
&#62; 
&#62; 9.)  It is NOT cheating to use portals to grant a lower level player 
&#62; access to a deep part of the labyrinth that they would otherwise be 
&#62; unable to visit, whilst they would have access to equipment that is 
&#62; &#34;before their time&#34;, they would surely get their ass whupped 
&#62; by the harder demons that lurk at the lower levels of the labyrinth, 
&#62; so everything equals out in the end.
&#62; 
&#62; 10.)  It IS cheating to use teleport in town, or any other 
&#62; &#34;illegal&#34; spells, that you would not normally be able to cast 
&#62; in town.
&#62; 
&#62; 11.)  Is it cheating for one character to give another one some gold? 
&#62;  Well, it depends.  If it is only a few hundred or so, then NO, it is 
&#62; not.  If however, it is piles of 5,000, then YES, that is definately 
&#62; cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; I appreciate your time and efforts of reading this, and the possible 
&#62; posting of a reply.  I am in no way, shape, or form, out to shed dis-
&#62; respect onto anyone, or offend anyone, and I hope that I have not 
&#62; done so.  I understand that everyone has their own views, and 
&#62; opinions about this subject, and that is the purpose of this.  To 
&#62; find out what people think.  Thank you for your time and effort.

Hello there,

I commented on the use and availability of Godly plate of ???. I hold 
true 
much of what you have stated here.

I have one comment though, if a player of a lower lvl joins in a 
campaign with  more experience players and is offered Duped items and 
he accepts, provided that he or she is experienced enough to have 
them; Would you consider this cheating. The reason I ask is that I 
view duping along the same lines that we used to view enchanted items 
in the days of AD&D and D&D. It is a discetionary thing. I mean for 
one there is the threat of pk'rs, but there is also the spirit of 
teamwork and a job well done. 

I recently gave a duped item to a fighter who showed allot of heart 
and teamwork during a campaign. He played with grace, fairness, and 
showed a great love for the adventure, so I rewarded him. Just as a 
player might be rewarded in the days of AD&D by receiving an 
enchanted item from a more experienced player after a great campaign.

Thank you,

Alaric LvL 29 Warrior.

Any comments would be most welcomed.......</pre>
