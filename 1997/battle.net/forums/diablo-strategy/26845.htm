<pre>Greetings.

I am pleased my posting got some attention, since I was of the belief 
with all those cheaters out there, nobody would ever take me serious.

To clear it up, I will now let it out how I did it. Greetings to 
Melissa the Sorceress, I am pleased you got the idea by reading my 
post CAREFULLY, as it identifies you as a real player, unlike those 
cheaters.

Now here it is.

The only purpose of my character was to test the effect of darkness 
on monsters. I had previously noticed that with the Goetterdaemerung 
helm, I attracted less monsters.  So I created a new character called 
&#34;Monster's_Pal&#34;, when I finally had found the last requisite 
in the dungeons that I needed to equip him: a ring of darkness, -
40&#37; light, worth 1 gold piece. I provided him the Scavenger 
Carapace, loads of Money, a Gold amulet of Presicion and a ring of 
Strength and the Goetterdamerung helm of course. The Black Skull 
shield has also -10&#37; light, so I gave it to him, too. One of my 
best swords, a bastard King's Sword of Speed, bought by my main 
Character (level 41), enabled him to do some damage (not much, 
though). That made him armor class 73 and 0&#37; resistances. I asked 
a friend to open a normal game via modem, and to create a town portal 
to hell. He did it and left, so that I was able to enter hell with a 
level 1 character. When I killed Diablo, I had already level 14. 
After playing a bit on the b.net with other players, I then felt 
ready for the attempt to do it in hell difficulty. I had noticed that 
I was totally invisible to the monsters, if I approched them on the 
diagonal. When I approached them directly, I was seen at a distance 
of one square. I had not used much infravision scrolls on the first 
dot mission, but I knew I would need them badly in hell difficulty. 
So I prepared that challenge and bought as much infravision scrolls 
as he was able to carry. When I entered hell difficulty via a modem 
game with my level 18 warrior (who still had 10 points to distribute 
left but already vitality of 100), I had on a reserve plate, 8 
potions in the belt, 2 town portal scrolls and the rest was filled by 
infravision ones (about 30). My game creator left and I entered hell. 
It was fairly easy to proceed through level 13 and 14, since I looked 
out not to approach a monster directly. So if there was a monster 
blocking the way, it never got to know what it killed since it 
couldn't see anything. I made mistakes, though, and attracted some 
from time to time...once three witches that had almost killed me (no 
resistances!). But I was able to escape through a town portal, and 
when I re-entered, I was able to escape them again, because I got 
invisible to them after having reached a certain distance.

Killing Lazarus and the unique witches was no severe proplem, since I 
kept invisible to them. Lazarus was also not very hard, with my 300 
hp I was able to stand one fireball.

In level 16 it proved to be harder, for as on the one hand my stock 
of infravisions had been halfed, and I had forgotten to purchase a 
telekinesis book on the other. I went up to level 1 and 5 (got almost 
killed in 5, had to drink all potions, then escape) and searched for 
a staff of telekinesis or a book, but after about a quarter of an 
hour I reentered hell since I had no luck. So I had to make it the 
normal way. I now realized that if I was killed, I wouldn't stand a 
chance to get back my equipment. When I again made one false step, a 
blood knight got aware of me and started hitting, I needed to use 5-6 
potions (one after every hit), to kill him. Fortunately, I had more 
space for potions now, since I had used many of my infras.

I proceeded and killed only if necessary, then opened the gate to 
diablo. I attracted the surrounding knights and ran away, then I went 
back to them and they didn't notice. It was fun. I killed about three 
Advocates blocking the way to diablo. Then I started swinging at him, 
and the poor guy neither knew what hit him nor inflicted even 1 hp of 
damage to me. After some time he died, and I had reached my goal.

:)

Still it was a challenge, so if you like, try it that way, I felt 
great when running around in the midst of Acid beasts, Advocates and 
so on...Standing in front of a monster that cant see me and swinging 
at it.

Monster's_Pal

p.s. Its enough to have -80&#37; light. the -10&#37; of the shield 
didnt take any effect.</pre>
