<pre>First off, I want to apologize for getting this summary posted so 
late. Our game publisher came into town and I was stuck in more 
meetings than I had planned on.

Anyway I dearly thank everyone who participated in this little 
survey. I am quite supprised by the number of posts that have been 
placed here. I expecially appreciate those of you who contacted me 
via Email and conversed through out the day. Your answers were very 
well justified and I really enjoyed reading them.

Below, you will see a quick list I made of the answers that where 
given along with totals in each area.  (*note*, had I to do this over 
again I would have remembered to add the stupid numbers to the 
&#34;#).&#34;'s you saw DOH!!!!)

(note: I'm hurring here, I may have counted some of these wrong).


Ok so what does this mean? DarkSniper Aside (I'll deal with you at 
the bottom DS) I thought it would be intersting on getting peoples 
input as to some issues I concider &#34;grey&#34; areas. Again, I 
ABSOLUTLY am not trying to defend cheating or not... just to point 
out that we *ALL* have opinions on what is legit or not. I was 
supprised with quite a few of the replies up there.

I think alot of people enjoyed reading others replies as they made 
very valid points both ways on subjects I thought would be 
&#34;landslide&#34; YES's or NO's. The closest split was on the issue 
of #7, Deye. The ones I was most suppried about would have to be 
#6,#9,#14 without a doubt.

So I'll bet more than a few are wanting me to post the anwers to my 
own questions. Here goes:

#1). &#34;accept Gold&#34;
This is not cheating. It may ruin the fun for those who use the gold 
as they are able to gain items they would not otherwise be able to 
have.

#2). &#34;accept Items&#34;
This is not cheating as long as the item is legit. It may ruin the 
players fun though.

#3). &#34;higher level chars buy items&#34;
This is a grey area. You cannot access something so you are having 
others access it for you. To this I would have to say, No, not 
cheating.

#4). &#34;elixers?&#34;
This is again like #3, a grey area. I cringe to give elixers to 
people below level 26 as blizz did not intend for them to get them at 
that level... I lean towards a YES here.

#5). &#34;clear levels&#34;
Not cheating.

#6). &#34;shopping&#34;
Absolutely is cheating. I think this is bending the rules of Diablo 
to restart hundreds of games in order to &#34;ramdomly&#34; get an 
item you wish. What is the difference between this and restarting 
games until you get one with &#34;easier&#34; creatures to get your 
exp? It is cheating (and I'm guiltly of it)

#7). &#34;use Deye&#34;
It is a cheat as it is an external program used to access something 
not availible in the spec of the game. However, I use it from time to 
time.

#8). &#34;lower players to portal&#34;
Not cheating. Blizz could have restricted players of too low a level 
from entering the portal.

#9). &#34;only purpose is to hold extra items?&#34;
I feel VERY strongly about this... IT IS CHEATING. I look at it like 
this, you are given a unique inventory space you have to fit items 
into within the game. You have to manage your inventory space to 
determine what items you intend to carry, what you have to give up 
etc. If blizz wanted you to have a zillion items, they would have 
given you inventory &#34;pages&#34; to fill up. Nope, blizz gave a 
static inventory space. Using other chars to expand this space is 
cheating.

#10). &#34;transfer items&#34;
Not cheating because if you find an item and it's legit, you should 
be able to put it on another char that you use as long as that char 
is *NOT* just a char to hold the item.

#11). &#34;Pk with the Nova spell?&#34;
I threw this one in... it's unethical but is not cheating. (hacked 
Nova is though!)

#12). &#34;Portal Kill someone?&#34;
Not cheating... very unethical, but not cheating.

#13). &#34;Teleport in town?&#34;
Definitly cheating. However, most people do not know of a bug in 
v1.03/1.04 that allows you to cast a spell in town without external 
cheats (is true! Rogue can cast Repair skill/staff recharge also). 
Either way you look at it, it's cheating (I have done this).

#14). &#34;backup chars&#34;
Absolutly cheating. Blizzard originally gave out the means to move 
char files to those who needed to either &#34;reformat&#34; their HD 
or get a new computer. I follow the Tech support base and really have 
not heard them state that this is also to be used for general 
backups. Another way to think about it, it's not in your game manual 
now is it? Nope, it was not intended to be backed up. (I backup 
though).


Anyway this is how I feel about it. Please, if you disagree with me 
or other people who have posted, do not flame anyone.... everyone has 
stated great opinions here. In the end, we all seem to have a 
different view of this expecially on the minor issues. Just be very 
careful when stating your &#34;legitimacy&#34; that you may 
unintentionally offend someone who holds a slightly different view 
than your own.

To close, HAVE FUN! Diablo has been one of the most amazing games I 
have ever played. Sometimes we tend to forget that while getting into 
these discussions. For myself.... I'm gonna go play more!

PS:
To DarkSniper:

    You are the most paraniod person I have seen in a long time! Do I 
scare you that much? Why do you see me as your nemesis? No matter 
what I post whether for good or bad, you are RIGHT there in my face. 
I have been really trying hard to avoid flaming you hard over this 
because you are really starting to annoy me. I can't believe your 
second post in the replies trying to twist this into some other 
argument about legitimacy. My thanks to Red Herring for his post at 
least giving me the benefit of this summary before saying anything. 

    You do *NOT* own this channel. I will not back down either (the 
raw amount email to me today from others shows me that even though we 
are not in agreement, there are alot of people who enjoy seeing me 
around here).

     Get over yourself DarkSniper, becomming the &#34;eugene&#34; of 
Stragety is not your best move.
