<pre>This is in response to being called a &#34;Moron with a point&#34; by 
Red Herring, I hope that you enjoy my Pulp Fiction parody. LONG!

&#62; Take a look at the reply you got to your post below.  Although he is 
&#62; a moron, he has a point. 

[If you've never seen Pulp Fiction, this may not make any sense to 
you.  Basically, I'm making fun of Red Herring.  Please forgive any 
spelling or grammer mistakes]

Scene: The coffee shop when Jules confronts &#34;Ringo&#34;

The part of Jules Winfield will be played by Fightin'Amish and the 
part of &#34;Ringo&#34; will be played by Red Herring.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

&#34;Do you read the strategy guide Herring?&#34; Asked Fightin'Amish.

&#34;Not regularly, no&#34; replied Herring.

&#34;Well there's this passage I got memorized,&#34; said 
Fightin'Amish.  &#34;Diablo 23:17, 'The path of the Moron with a 
Point is beset on all sides by the IQ's of the Gifted and the 
arrogance of Educated Men.  Blessed is he who in the name of Wisdom 
and Higher Learning guides the Moron through the Halls of 
Enlightenment, for he is truly the Moron's teacher.  And I will 
strike down upon thee with great ignorance and furious stupidity 
those who would make fun of my Moron and you will know my name is the 
Professor when I lay my Intelligence upon thee!&#34;

&#34;Now I been saying that sh*t for years,&#34; continued Amish. 
&#34;I never really though about what it meant.  I just thought it 
was some cold blooded sh*t to say to a mutha f*cka before I popped an 
arrow in his as*.  Some sh*t happened today that changed all that.  
See, it could mean that I'm the 'Teacher' and my 2 cents is the 
'Gifted' and it's this forum that is full of 'ignorance.'  Or it 
could mean that I'm the Professor, and it's the forum that is filled 
with Morons.  Now I'd like that, but that sh*t ain't the truth.  The 
truth is, YOUR the arrogant and I'm the Moron with a Point.  But I'm 
trying Herring, I'm trying real hard to be the Professor.&#34;


Haha, hoped you enjoyed that.
