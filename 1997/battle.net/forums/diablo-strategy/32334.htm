<pre>Nicely detailed request.  Good job.
1. The caves are hard for a level 16 rogue.  As you already wrote, go 
very slow.
2. Lose the armor.  You don't want to be shining +40&#37; light.  You 
become a walking beacon.
3. Lose the empryean band.  Your ring of stability already gives you 
hit recovery (Not cumulative).  For the +20&#37; light, look at 
number 2.  +2 to all is minimal.
4. Use the gold bow of shock.  Better base damage, better to-hit 
percentage, and lava lords and mud runners are susceptible to 
lightning.
5. Use lightning spell against monsters.  One or two can knock out 
three to six, depending on how they are lined up.
6. Since your vitality is low, get the mana shield scroll from Adria 
if possible.  This will allow you to double your hit points.
7. Nice amulet.  Keep it.
8. Sell two out of your four bows, and use the money to buy a better 
armor.  Even a normal armor with base AC over 18 is better than the 
one you have.  If your strength is too weak to wear better armor, you 
may have to forgoe your amulet, until you level up or find a 
ring/armor that increases your strength.  If you find the armor, wear 
the amulet to wear the armor, and then take off the amulet.  The STR 
bonus on the armor will allow you to keep the armor on.

Hope these will help.

&#62; I am a level 16 rogue in single player. I just got to level 9, the 
&#62; first level of the caves. My problem is that no matter how cautious I 
&#62; am, I keep getting whooped by mud runners and lava lords who kill me 
&#62; before I can do anything. This really sucks. Does anybody have any 
&#62; tips for me?
&#62; 
&#62; Here are my stats:
&#62; 
&#62; Strength:     35
&#62; Magic:         30
&#62; Dexterity:    68
&#62; Vitality:       27
&#62; 
&#62; My equipment is:
&#62; 
&#62; Mail of Radiance                      Amber Cap
&#62;  AC: 18 Dur: 55                         AC: 3 Dur: 15
&#62; +40&#37; Light Radius                   Resist all +18&#37;
&#62; 
&#62; Obsidian amulet of Sorcery     Empyrean Band

&#62; +18 to Magic                            +20&#37; Light Radius
&#62;                                                 Fast hit Recovery
&#62; Ring of Stability                       Absorbs 1/2 of trap damage
&#62; Faster hit Recovery
&#62;                                               
&#62; Bow of Perfection
&#62; Damage 3-6 Dur: 45

&#62; 
&#62; Using this equipment, my strength is 37, my magic is 50, my dextery 
&#62; is 100, my vitality is 29, my life is 85, my mana is 97, my armor 
&#62; class is 41, my to hit &#37; is 100&#37;, my damage is 13-16, and my

&#62; +19&#37;, +10 strength), and an optic amulet (+20&#37; light radius, 
&#62; Resist Lightning +20&#37;, -1 damage from enemies, +5 to magic). Once 
&#62; again, can anybody help me?
