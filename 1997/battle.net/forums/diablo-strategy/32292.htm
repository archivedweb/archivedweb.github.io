&#62; OK, so if Stone Cursing a monster does not give you any exp when it 
&#62; dies,
&#62; I have another question for you.
&#62; 
&#62; Many people here seem to like the idea of going into hell with a mage 
&#62; and
&#62; a rogue, or rogues and a mage of any combination...
&#62; 
&#62; The favorite strategy seems to be to have the mage stone the monsters 
&#62; (the immune
&#62; all's specifically) and have the rogue pick them off.
&#62; 
&#62; If that is the case, won't problems arise since the Rogue is 
&#62; obtaining all the Experience?
&#62; 
&#62; I know personally, since I'd be the mage, I'd be kinda pissed... :)
&#62; 
&#62; Xix


If the purpose of the expedition is to gain EXP then yes, the 
Sorcerer gets hosed if his only participation is to Stone Curse for 
the others.

Personally (and yes Aahz, I almost read your whole post below) I feel 
that if a Sorcerer is taking the &#34;passive&#34; role in a game, I 
will either alternate level clearing with him or at least take turn's 
clearing rooms (in the game with me Aahz, DarkSniper and Art, we 
weren't going for EXP rather a specific object (OZ) which my char 
seems to find more than other players hence I killed more creatures 
looking for the &#34;golden drop&#34; (I believe the Obsid Stars came 
from a creature I dropped).

Anyway I think it takes strong resolve for a Sorcerer to ONLY Stone 
Curse expecially in a level where things are supceptable to 
Fireballs. As for myself, I concider it curtious to allow them to 
kill as much as I do.

I also think that if *ANYONE* feels that they are not getting enough 
&#34;action&#34; then SPEAK UP!!!! You have as much right to the 
killing as others and if you are all friends, they should realize 
they may have been a little caught up in the action and not realized 
they are &#34;hogging&#34; the creatures..

If you are in a public game and everyone else is killing the 
creatures, drop to the next level when no-one is looking ;)
