&#62; &#62; I just earned my second dot on a solo mission.  But I'm curious if 
&#62; &#62; someone has some useful input for me.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; First, I launched about 10 flame waves into Diablo's lair.  After 
&#62; &#62; dodging his sewage and doing the stone curse/fireball thing on all of 
&#62; &#62; the pursuant knights, it was just me and Diablo.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I laid no less than 20 bone spirits (I went down with 35 mana 
&#62; &#62; potions) 
&#62; &#62; and 15 fireballs (hits; I must have fired off about 30 total) before 
&#62; &#62; he bit it.  With 15th level flame wave (min 210 damage) and fireball 
&#62; &#62; (min 400ish damage), add in 20 bone spirits. . .  You do the math.  
&#62; &#62; That's a spicy meatball!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I know that Diablo has resistance to this, that and the other.  So 
&#62; &#62; here are my questions:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 1.  If you &#34;resist&#34; something, does it reduce the amount of 
&#62; &#62; damaged caused, or do you simply take no damage x&#37; of the time?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 2.  Does Diablo have a set amount of hit points?  Does anybody know 
&#62; &#62; what the total is?  Does anybody know what kind of calculations are 
&#62; &#62; used to figure his hit points?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Any help is appreciated.

&#62; i took a guy that had 343-865 damage and kill him with three hits so 
&#62; around 1029-2595 that was only on normal though.

  Well, got Diablo last weekend, and just beat it today for the first 
time. I was playing as a warrior, and I kept getting my ass kicked, 
but then I tried Griswold's Edge, and that just dominated him. It 
knocked him back and he couldnt hit me with his up close swing, and 
it took me about 15-20 hits with it to kill him. Not to tough in 
single player. Is it different in multi-player? I would like to hear 
back from anyone w/info. Thanks.</pre>
