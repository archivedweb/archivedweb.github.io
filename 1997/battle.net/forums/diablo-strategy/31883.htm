<pre>Well, I think I just met a thief for the first time on b.net. it 
happened when I asked someone to help me with transfering items 
between my chars. I offered him some elixirs. Once we were in a game, 
there were three of us, the others are &#34;scott&#34; and 
&#34;zamba&#34;. After giving elixirs, I began to drop items. One of 
them is a mindcry, then they come around and we had a short 
conversation. Meantime, the mindcry just disappeared. I asked them if 
anyone took them, they said none of them took it. Here came a 
conclusion: COMP ATE IT. Yeah, they told me that and they really 
thought that I was really stupid enough to believe them. How the hell 
couldn't I tell the difference between someone took the stuff and the 
bug. The bug usually happens when we're trying to pick up something 
while opening the inventory window. Well, I just let it go, don't 
care much about the mindcry because I don't really need it. I just 
love collecting unique items I've found, I even keep a fool's crest.

After all, my point is we can't really trust people even in the 
virtual world. Or can we???
