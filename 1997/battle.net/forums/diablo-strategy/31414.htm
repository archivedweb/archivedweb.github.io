<pre>Hi fellow Rogues (and whoever),

For a long time I thought Gotterdammerung was one of the most 
dangerous items you could use --it reduced visibility to almost 
nothing and reduced all resistances to nil.  It had great potential, 
tho -- +20 to all attributes, AC of 60, -4 to damage and high 
durability.  I found it early on, tried it, and tossed it --greatly 
disappointed (as it looks cool too).  However, after finding it for 
about a third time, I decided to try something new.  I bought all the 
infravision scrolls I could find at Adrias, grabbed my favorite bow, 
used all the cool Drake amulets and stuff that raised mana levels and 
went hunting in Hell.   Well, after raising my mana shield, casting a 
safety valve portal behind the stairs, I cast infravision and began 
walking...  into a room full of critters, mostly witches.. and guess 
what happened?  Nothing!  I could see them, but the could not see me 
unless I walked right up on them or hit them with my arrows/spells.  
It was a cakewalk!  One by one, the bimbos and critters dropped like 
flies as my withering barrage of arrows sailed out of the blackness 
into their vividly red forms.  It took a little bit of practice to 
learn how to target them, but once I did, they were at my mercy.  I 
had a total blast!!!  Diablo became really exciting to me again using 
this tactic I call Stealth mode:  Gotterdammerung + Infravision + a 
good bow (the Merciless, Weird kind, or Eaglehorn (my personal 
favorite)).  If you want to have some fun, I suggest you try this.  
It may not be mass destruction (ala mages), but it is role-playing 
the Rogue as she was intended:  the silent, stalking, denizen of the 
deep!  Enjoy!</pre>
