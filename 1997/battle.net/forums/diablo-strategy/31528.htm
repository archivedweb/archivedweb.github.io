<blockquote>
<pre>I have long been reading this forum, and the sheer volume of posts on 
the subject of &#34;cheating vs. legit&#34; in Diablo never ceases to 
amaze and annoy me.  It seems that the land of Tristram has been 
divided into two distinct sects, cheaters and legit players.  I, 
however, believe that the distinction is not as clear as many would 
like to think.  This post details my thoughts on the subject.  Call 
it an opinion, call it a vent, call it what you will.  

First, let us examine the typical &#34;cheater.&#34;  What drives a 
person to cheating?  Maybe frustration with their inability to play 
well.  Maybe a need to dominate others to boost their ego.  Or 
perhaps just boredom with the game.  Whatever the reason, they have 
chosen to alter the game for themselves and/or others.  Their methods 
are many.  Duping, hacking items, godmode, ghostmode, inflating their 
attributes or spells; just to name a few.  Some are good-natured.  
Some are malevolent and rampant pk's.  They are the bane of the 
&#34;legit&#34; player.

The typical &#34;legit&#34; player is the &#34;anti-cheater.&#34;  
They detest duping, hacks and other &#34;impure&#34; methods of play. 
 To them, cheaters have ruined the game as it was intended.  They 
often consider themselves above the cheater, and are generous with 
flames that state the fact.  Some have even dedicated themselves to 
&#34;rescuing&#34; newbies from the pitfall of cheating.  Many join 
guilds where they can play legit games with their legit friends.  
They are often thought of as the &#34;good guys&#34; of battlenet.

Now, at first inspection, these two groups may seem all-inclusive.  
But I propose that there is a third group lost somewhere in between.  
They are less apparent, but are possibly the greatest in number.  We 
have sometimes seen glimpses of these players in posts here titled, 
&#34;Is this cheating?&#34;, etc.  They are players who selectively 
do things that other players may consider cheating.  I place myself 
in this middle group, and I would argue that most people who claim to 
be &#34;legit&#34; belong here, too.

As an example, I will use a recent post from this forum.  
[Disclaimer:  The use of this individual as an example does not imply 
that I am picking on him, and does not require a flame in return.  :-
)]  The poster claims outright to be &#34;legit.&#34;  He explains 
that he recently convinced a newbie to cast off cheating and join him 
in legitimacy.  As part of this, he instructed the newbie not to 
accept duped or hacked items.  The two played together, but the 
newbie played the church while the poster went to hell.  The poster 
returns with items (rings and armor) from hell and gives them to the 
newbie to help him stay alive in the catacombs.  Now, I would claim 
that the newbie's acceptance of these items jeopardizes his 
reputation as a &#34;legit&#34; player.  Would he have gotten these 
items on his own at his level?  Mind you, I'm not saying this is 
WRONG.  In fact, I admire the poster's intentions.  I'm just saying 
that it isn't (in my opinion) 100&#37; &#34;pure.&#34;

But on to the point.  I see legitimacy, not as a divergent issue, but 
as a CONTINUUM.  Put simply, it is not a black and white issue.  It 
is an expansive range of shades of gray.  At one end is the 
&#34;extreme cheater&#34; who uses every hack in the book.  At the 
other end is the &#34;true legit.&#34;  In my opinion this is one who 
does not use any cheats/hacks/accessory programs, does not dupe, and 
does not use anything that he does not kill or buy himself.  Now I'm 
sure that many of you are thinking, &#34;That's ridiculous.  Your 
standards for a 'true legit' are too high.&#34;  In response, I would 
say that it's supposed to be.  It's an extreme, the end of the 
continuum.  There is no implication, on my part, that you should even 
TRY to be a &#34;true legit.&#34;  

I propose the following examples to illustrate this idea. They are 
roughly ranked in order from most legit to least legit.  [Disclaimer 
#2:  This list is not intended to be all inclusive, nor is the order 
of ranking necessarily &#34;gospel.&#34;]

*  &#34;True legit.&#34;
*  Backing up characters in case of system crashes.
*  Taking legit items from other players.
*  Taking legit items from higher level players.
*  Using hacks for protection against cheating pk's.
*  Creating, using, giving, and taking duped items.
*  Creating, using, giving, taking, and duping hacked items.
*  Hacking stats, spells, etc.
*  Godmode, etc.
*  &#34;Extreme cheater.&#34;
  
And now, my second point (this is the venting part).  The legitimacy 
continuum is in no way related to being good or bad.  Being a cheater 
doesn't necessarily make you BAD.  And being &#34;legit&#34; 
certainly doesn't make you better than everyone else.  I don't know 
which is worse, pk'ing cheaters who ruin games, or so-called 
&#34;legits&#34; on their high horse throwing around flames.  For 
example, how many times have I heard the &#34;press Alt-F4 to 
dupe&#34; line, or, even worse, attempts to try to get cheaters to 
reformat their hard drives?  If, as a &#34;legit&#34;, you really 
want to be a &#34;good guy&#34;, throwing around childish insults and 
being downright destructive is not the way.  Don't play with people 
if you don't approve of their place in the continuum.  But let them 
play the way they want.  Everyone (well, almost) has payed for the 
game, just like everyone else.  And everyone has the right to enjoy 
the game however they wish. 

As an attempt at setting a good example, I'll relate a recent 
experience of mine.  I started a public game on battlenet.  I almost 
always begin a night on battlenet in a public game, usually titled 
&#34;TheTruffulaGrove.pureonlyplease&#34; (feel free to drop in 
sometime if you want.)  Anyway, I was playing with my warrior, and I 
was soon joined by a rogue who was near the same level as I.  I went 
to town to meet her, and she claimed to be &#34;legit&#34;.  I 
noticed, however, that her hit points seemed a little high.  &#34;Oh, 
well,&#34; I thought, &#34;we'll give it a try.&#34;  We went to the 
catacombs, and played fairly well together.  She was considerate, and 
cooperative.  I was enjoying myself.  But quite suddenly, I wasn't 
having much fun.  I looked at my health, and I was almost dead.  She 
had accidentally shot me with ONE arrow, and it almost killed me.  I 
popped open a portal, and jumped in.  She said, &#34;what are you 
doing?&#34;  I told her, &#34;your damage is just too high, you 
almost killed me with one shot.&#34;  She assured me that she was 
&#34;legit&#34; ... she had just gotten some good items from a 
friend.  I explained that I was sorry, but I just wasn't comfortable 
playing with her.  I thanked her for playing with me, bid her good 
venturing, and left to start a new game, 
&#34;TheTruffulaGrove2.pureonlypleas&#34;.  Now maybe she was using 
hacked equipment.  Maybe not.  It didn't matter.  There was no need 
to accuse, there was no need to preach.  The very next game, I met 
&#34;Rook&#34;, a mage with a gaming attitude similar to mine.  We 
played well together, but were soon pk'ed by an obvious cheater :-(.  
We didn't have to flame him.  We simply quietly moved on to a private 
game, and had a great time playing together for the rest of the 
evening.

Now, to sum up this long story, it was a normal night on battlenet.  
I met a polite &#34;cheater&#34;, I met an impolite 
&#34;cheater&#34;, and I met a polite &#34;legit&#34;.  I didn't 
flame, I didn't judge.  I simply played with the person I was 
comfortable with, and had a good time.

When I first decided to write this post, the forum was overrun with 
people preaching about the evils of cheating, flaming any cheater who 
asked for help.  Today, though, I noticed several posts from people 
who seem to have the &#34;live and let live&#34; attitude that I try 
to keep.  (Lestat, Code Myster, and Saint Michael, just to name a 
few.)  They make this post a little like old news, but I'm glad to 
see them.  I truly believe that if more people followed this way of 
thinking, battlenet would be a better place.

You might want to know where I believe I fit into the continuum.  On 
a scale from 0-10 (why does everyone always leave out 0?), with 0 
being the &#34;extreme cheater&#34;, and 10 being the &#34;true 
legit&#34;, I would rank myself at 8 or 9.  In the past, I used the 
trainer to see ghosts, but recently ditched it after I noticed my 
warrior's spell levels jumped to 16 for no apparent reason.  (I had 
to set all spells to level 0 and start my book hunt over to feel 
comfortable with myself).  I back up my characters regularly and 
restore them when I lose items to server problems or cheating (but 
not legit) mk's.  I have accepted items from a friend who I play with 
often who is near the same level as I.  Otherwise, I'd say I'm pure.  
Am I a cheater?  Am I legit? ... Does it matter?  I would argue that 
the answer to all three questions  is &#34;no.&#34;

Finally, I'd like to thank you for you patience , if you're still 
reading :-).  I realize this post is VERY long (I might have a record 
here), but this stuff has been welling up inside me for a long time, 
and finally getting it out feels good.  I realize that this post may 
offend some people.  Please know that this is not my intention.  I 
also realize that this post will soon be lost to that great bit-
bucket in the sky.  Cheating pk's will continue to ruin the fun for 
others.  &#34;Legits&#34; on their high horses will flame away.  I 
only hope that I have made you think for a moment about the value of 
tolerance.

So, in conclusion, I think this &#34;legit vs. cheater&#34; argument 
is way out of hand.  Legitimacy is a continuum, not a finite state.  
In fact, many players who claim to be &#34;legit&#34; are not 
completely pure.  My advice to you ... Find a place in the continuum 
where you are comfortable playing, play with people who you are 
comfortable with,  and do not judge others for their choice.
