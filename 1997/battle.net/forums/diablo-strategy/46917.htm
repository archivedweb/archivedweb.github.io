&#62; 
&#62; I was in NM hell last night I did some stupid things and I got myself 
&#62; killed and lost all my equipment.  So I scraped my money together, 
&#62; bought some basic equipment and went down to reg hell to try to re-
&#62; equip myself.  On lvl 13 I found a Fool's Crest and I was not amused. 
&#62;  Then Lazurus dropped a unique helm and I thought my luck was finally 
&#62; changing- perhaps the RC I've been searching for.  I pick it up and 
&#62; check my inventory and yes - it is another Fool's Crest. TWO in the 
&#62; same game!  At this point I decided someone was telling me it is time 
&#62; to quit for the day.
&#62; 
&#62; Val lvl 34 rogue
&#62; .

i had a comparable experience.  not only were duplicate unique items 
dropped in the same game, they were dropped in the same room.  again, 
one came from lazarus, but i'm not sure who dropped the other.
i forget what the items were, but i know i sold the armor.  blessed 
full plate of absorbtion can be beat, but i think i'll bo looking a 
while.
