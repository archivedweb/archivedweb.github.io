<pre>To all,

         I have recently have done a test on Blood Suffix.

The Items that are used are soldier's bastard sword of blood and Helm 
of Sprits (Unique)  Both takes 5&#37; hp.  If you attack a monster 
like Blood Knight and you did 100 points of Damage, you'll gain 5 hp 
back.  Now, the true test was on the case of 'what if you added 2 
blood items.'  The only possibilities are Helm of Sprits with a Sword 
of Blood.  I equiped my warrior who finally found the soldiers's 
bastard sword of blood few days ago.  Since only the Helm of Sprits 
were put on and off, the damage range was same (Max, Min and average 
Hp gain was same :).  I Stoned the same monster, I think it was Azure 
Drake.  And Hit him many times and recorded the Hp received each hit. 
 The findings were same weather or not if the Helm of Sprits were 
worn or not.  Therefore, if you found the Helm of Sprits like me, use 
a sword that doesn't have Blood suffix since it won't help you.  I am 
using King's bastard sword of Haste (bought from Gris), so I'm 
getting blood in hasted form.  It's really great.  Any warrior out 
there should seek out for the Helm of Sprits, since it'll help you 
out.  It's most useful if you are a high lvl warrior since the AC on 
the Helm of Sprits is only 6. :(  Good Hunting everyone. :)

     Lestat, lost and confused.</pre>
