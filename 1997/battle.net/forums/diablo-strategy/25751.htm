<pre>I just want to know anything about this level! Some people talks that 
it is real!!!!! I dont belive that! Can you say something?

 I have this instruction but i did not try it yet:
Here are instructions on getting to the cow level. I've seen
      instructions on various websites, but most of them are bogus.
      I tested the following and they actually work:

      1. First you have to have townkill enabled, so download a
      program like DiabHack and turn townkill on.
      2. In the village, create a town portal in between the cows.
      3. Walk about 10 paces up from the portal, but not so far that
      you can't see it.
      4. Click on the portal. You will start walking toward it. At the
      exact moment when you are entering the portal, cast teleport. 
(Just
      like you were duping except you cast teleport instead of 
touching
      a potion on your belt). You will then be transported to the
      cow level. If you messed up you will simply reappear in town.
      5. It takes a few tries to work, but its well worth the effort!
      The cow level has a couple of new enemies which are very hard, 
eg.
      normal/cow level is about as hard as hell/hell. You can find 
tons
      of good equipment here; I found rings of the zodiac, king's bow,
      and sword of the crusaders.

      Good luck!</pre>
