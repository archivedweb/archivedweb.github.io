&#62; 
&#62; You don't have to be a rogue to identify which chests  are trapped.  
&#62; There are actually two types of traps, those that are sprung right 
&#62; from the chest itself and those that come flying out of the wall.  If 
&#62; the former, you are out of luck, only a rogue can figure out whether 
&#62; its trapped or not.  The latter kind of chest, however can be 
&#62; detected and avoided by any class.  Before opening a chest look at 
&#62; all walls that surround the chest.  If you see a dark circle on the 
&#62; wall, the chest is trapped.  Avoiding the trap is easy.  
&#62;

&#62; 
&#62; The hole will always be placed one square away from the chest.  
&#62; (above, hole = 0 and Chest =C, the hole is one column to the right of 
&#62; the Chest.)  Standing in any of the X locations to open the chest, 
&#62; are your best bets at remaining safe.   Standing in any of the B(ad) 
&#62; locations will get you toasted/skewered.
&#62;
i've found that he missile will seek out the spot where you were 
standing when you opened the chest.  therefore, the strategy that 
works for me is to open and keep walking.  it targets where i was 
standing, but fortunately...i'm not there anymore! :)
 
&#62; 
&#62; By the way, has anyone ever been killed by their own Golem?  I was 
&#62; playing my new mage yesterday and walked into a Golem swing.  Killed 
&#62; me right off (you don't lose your equipment, BTW) and then the Golem 
&#62; died when I restarted.....Do you think he was committing suicide?

your golem is 1-0 in duels!  i bet he kept your ear too.  he died 
because when you restarted you were no longer on the same level as 
him...blammo.

how about nother newbie strat...filling your inventory :

i try and keep my inventory looking like this at lower levels

pppp  sshh   h=helm
pppp  sshh   s=staff/shield whatever (anything 3 spaces tall)
pp    ss     p=potion/scroll
pppppppppp

why do i do this?  well, when you pick up potions and scrolls in the 
dungeon they get placed in the lowest row with a space open, and in 
the leftmost spot on that row.  therefore with my inventory like this 
i can pick up two potions and then still pick up a 2x3 item and not 
have to move stuff to fit it.  plus, when you pick up gold it gets 
placed in the lowest row possible, in the rightmost space on that 
row.  any gold i pick up gets thrown under the helm (or rings, pots, 
etc.) and i don't have to worry about *that* blocking an item 
placement either.  as a bonus, since my pots are mostly on the left 
of my inventory, i can open my inventory in a battle (as a last 
resort) and drink straight out of it without moving the mouse very 
far from battle.  hope this helps, it is my time-tested strategy.
