<blockquote>
<pre>I'm glad to see a number of interesting and intelligent discussions 
of cheating posted in the last few days by CM and others (rather 
similar to the PK debates a few weeks back).  It's also rather 
interesting seeing some of the same arguments made in that debate 
resurfacing in some of the posts below (e.g., Sprite's argument about 
the creator of the game setting the rules of that particular game is 
the same meta-game argument I made against the backstabbing PKer who 
enters a &#34;co-op&#34; only game).

Lorax, I agree that there is a continuum of behavior that people find 
acceptable or unacceptable, and I think your list is fairly accurate. 
I do not think &#34;legit&#34; is the proper term for one extreme of 
your continuum, however, because there is a range of behavior that 
some players do not engage in that is nevertheless entirely 
&#34;legitimate.&#34;  (By &#34;legitimate&#34;, I mean within the 
structure, rules, limitations, and design of the game as created and 
intended by Blizzard).  For example, some people will not accept 
items from anyone else, regardless of whether the items are legit or 
duped.  Trading items obviously was intended to be a part of the game 
by Blizzard (and an important part), is clearly permitted within the 
game design and structure, and thus cannot seriously be considered 
&#34;cheating.&#34;  Similarly, some people feel that it is wrong for 
low level characters to trade for or be given powerful items, even if 
legit/non-duped.  This also is clearly permitted within the game 
design, and thus cannot be considered cheating.

All of these behaviors are technically &#34;legit&#34;, even though 
some &#34;legit&#34; players may not like the way other 
&#34;legit&#34; players play.  Thus, a more appropriate term for the 
pure, I-found-it-myself player at the one end of your list might be 
&#34;purist.&#34;  

The legit/cheat line does exist and can be drawn in the continuum 
according to how one defines &#34;cheat&#34; and &#34;legit.&#34;  
Most people seem to agree on a general definition of these terms in 
relation to the game along the lines of the one I gave above 
(actually, I only defined &#34;legit&#34; above;  I would define 
&#34;cheat&#34; as the inverse of legit, or the use of external 
programs or internal bugs or anomalies to achieve a result contrary 
to the intention of the designers or creators of the game.  BTW, 
&#34;cheat&#34; also has a broader meaning as someone who uses 
deception or lies to injure someone or deprive them of something of 
value, and thus could be applied to the &#34;backstabbing&#34; PKer 
who is technically &#34;legit&#34; in game terms.)

I thus would draw the legit/cheat line after the fourth or so item 
(like you, I believe the use of a backup program to protect yourself 
from system crashes, etc., is not cheating--I think a system crash is 
akin to having a chessboard knocked over by your dog; it is not 
cheating to set the pieces back in place and continue your game, and 
it is not cheating to save your character from being &#34;knocked 
off&#34; by Microsoft).  I do consider using godmode or other hacks 
to protect oneself from PKers to be a cheat, but please note that I 
am not stating that this behavior is morally right or wrong.  It may 
in fact be &#34;justified&#34; cheating, an issue I raised earlier in 
the debate on PKing (the unresolved question of whether cheating is 
ever justified is an interesting issue).

I agree that flames, obscenity, etc. add nothing to the discussion.  
I also feel the same about broad assertions about cheating or legit 
play in general.  The point of discussion should be about a 
particular pattern of behavior: what is it, what effect does it have 
on game play and other players, what is it being used for, etc. (in 
effect, a discussion as where to draw the line).  The placement of 
the &#34;line&#34; doesn't automatically create a parallel division 
between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34;, but would then enable us to 
discuss whether that particular behavior is &#34;good&#34; or 
&#34;bad&#34; in context (BTW, I am not a moral relativist, at least 
from the individual's point of view).  

Thank you for a very thoughtful post.

&#62; Ya know, one of the reasons I liked the character Aahz so much is 
&#62; that he can put into words his feelings... I try to do just that but 
&#62; often fail and end up starting a war or two :)
&#62; 
&#62; You my friend, have easily summed up my feelings 100&#37; in your 
&#62; post. I hope others will read this and possibly understand what I 
&#62; meant in past posts.
&#62; 
&#62; I am not a char as &#34;white as the driven snow&#34;, I don't think 
&#62; I ever truely claimed to be. I have cheated a little, I will continue 
&#62; to cheat a little. I have played more games of Diablo than alot of 
&#62; people who post here combined. On your scale of 0-10 with 10 being 
&#62; &#34;legit&#34; I would rank myself at 7.5. 
&#62; 
&#62; I really don't know how to close this message.... I'm still getting 
&#62; over the shock of the original post. If I could only have 1 wish in 
&#62; Diablo right now, it would be that all the self proclaimed 
&#62; &#34;legits&#34; really read and study the above post. 
&#62; 
&#62; Again, thank you for your post, if nothing else, it means alot to me.
