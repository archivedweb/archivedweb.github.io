&#62; Dear all,
&#62; 
&#62; I've been venturing deep into the dark labyrinths of Hell together
&#62; with my trusted companion Sir Oppy. We've encountered a problem 
&#62; though...
&#62; I do an extensive amount of damage with my arrows...more than Sir 
&#62; Oppy's armour can handle actually...:). We've tried several 
&#62; strategies but to no avail.
&#62; We've come up with another strategy...one where I shout:&#34;Watch 
&#62; out...I'm going to let one fly. Get out of the way...!!!&#34;.
&#62; You can imagine that should I type this in the heat of battle Sir 
&#62; Oppy would probably be lying crushed on the cold dungeon floor and I 
&#62; would be surrounded by Slayers breathing heavy on my new and sexy 
&#62; Rogue costume...not a pleasant thought.
&#62; 
&#62; Does anyone know which file I should edit to change the messages that 
&#62; are under the F9-F12 keys to one that is more of my liking...?

There is a diablo.ini file in the Diablo directory.  Just use a text 
editor and change what is says.
 
&#62; Second question...does anyone have any suggestions on how a warrior 
&#62; can make himself transparant to my arrows...or any other tips on how 
&#62; a rogue and a warrior should play toghether? Killing monsters I 
&#62; mean...not any other &#34;playing&#34;...;)

Well there are a few hints.

1. Warriors, unless they like dying, should never fight in the middle 
of a room.  They should always hug the walls and let the monsters 
come to them.  If the monsters have ranged attacks then scoot along 
the walls and get to the monsters that way.  

2. Rogues should usually attempt to dominate a room by covering the 
center of a room.  If a monster runs along a wall, let the warrior 
take him.  If the thing runs through the center of a room, then the 
rogue should take him.

3. Rogues should always fire arrows in 2 shot &#34;bursts&#34; and 
*never* more than that.  You can see for yourself that if you start 
clicking that mouse too much that there is a 2 arrow &#34;lag&#34;.  
Usually this translates into 2 arrows being fired before an arrow 
gets fired at the location you last clicked. 

What this does is setup a stream of arrows that is very hard to 
manage and dangerous for everyone else.  By using a 2 shot burst you 
will take out monsters faster (i.e. no lag to deal with) and more 
accurately.  And best of all if your friend does get hit, it will be 
with a maximum of 2 arrows and not 5 or more.

4. Coordinate actions and movements.  Talk about how you are going to 
handle specific situations.  There are a number of (nearly) standard 
actions.

a. The Retreat: You have just gone some place you really didn't want 
to go and now you have to book.  Set up a leapfrogging technique so 
that all of you know what you're supposed to do.  I.e. Warrior stands 
and does a rear guard action while rogue gets ready, warrior retreats 
along a wall while rogue covers with arrow fire, mage selects 
appropriate spell so warrior and rogue get out of the way.  Repeat.

b. Clearing a small room:  Who goes first?  What order?  Who will act 
as the &#34;Distance Medic&#34; with Heal Other? etc.

c. Clearing a large room:  Same as above but also includes &#34;How 
do we avoid activating all the of the monsters at once?&#34;.

Etc. 

Hope this helped a little.
