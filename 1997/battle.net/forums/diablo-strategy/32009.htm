<pre>hmm... nice definition of cheating, I agree with u to some extend but 
not all....

&#62; 5.)  Using a program, such as one of the trainers that is out there, 
&#62; to grant immunity to other player's attacks is NOT cheating, unless 
&#62; participating in a duel, of coarse.  Reason being, with all of the 
&#62; PKers out there, one MUST protect oneself.  I know TONS of people 
&#62; disagree with this, but, it is an easy solution, to a BIG problem 
&#62; like PKers.

i don't agree with this... being hit by other player is very common. 
Yeah, i understand there r pk out there, but not every players r pk. 
If u met a pk, u can alwiz join a new game b4 getting killed. I don't 
itz that hard pressing the ESC key then click on &#34;new game&#34;. 
using a trainer will loss itz excitement of being accidentally kill 
by other players:P
 
&#62; 6.)  Having other players buy items for you (from Griswald, Wirt, or 
&#62; Adria) is NOT cheating PROVIDING that they are the same level as you, 
&#62; or damn near the same level, and also providing that you have the 
&#62; required amount of gold.

beep... wrong again. having other player to buy weapon for u is okie, 
provided u r capable of wearing it (with zodiac ring or amulet). 
Besically I think gold is the least important thing in the game, 
cause u can alwiz get more.

&#62; 11.)  Is it cheating for one character to give another one some gold? 
&#62;  Well, it depends.  If it is only a few hundred or so, then NO, it is 
&#62; not.  If however, it is piles of 5,000, then YES, that is definately 
&#62; cheating.

Same as before, I don't agree with this. Whatz wrong with giving a 
person $5000??? I alwiz give other player gold when i don't have any 
spare weapon or armour with me. When s player is more then level 20, 
he/she can easily find more then 20k gold by simply starting a new 
nightmare game, and complete the 1st 4 levels. do u get what i 
mean?... gold is not important in the game!!! you can easily get 
more:)
