&#62; Does anyone use axes? Or does everyone sell them right away because 
&#62; they're too slow and 2 handed? I saw a post ealier that rogues should

&#62; good staves or 1 handed items because they need a shield, and I guess 
&#62; warriors should get 1 handed items because they need a shield in Hell.

First of all, use what you are comfortable with. Most people aren't 
comfortable with an axe, or don't like using them because of the AC 
difference. There are times when, and when not to use an axe. When 
you have all melee monsters on a level, you might want to put the axe 
away, because AC can make a world of difference, unless you  have a 
high enough AC, to that it doesn't make much of a difference. But, if 
you have all Witches, you can use that axe, without (much)worry. I 
say this, because of the fact that AC does not matter against witches 
(if I am wrong, feel free to point it out). Resistance does. This 
goes for normal hell. In nightmare, you'll need an axe that has a +to 
hit prefix(and a +dex suffix, for added fun). Then you're back in 
bussiness. At higher levels, you'll be able to stun lock witches even 
without a speed, or haste suffix (at level 31, I can stun lock all 
types of witches except soul burners with my Master's axe). In 
Hell/hell, you WILL NEED a King's axe of something REALLY good, or, 
put that axe right back in your backpack on melee levels. A kings 
bastard of haste or slaughter and a very good shield would be your 
best bet on hell/hell anyway. 
All characters should pick up magical items, and sell them if you 
don't need them, or want them.
