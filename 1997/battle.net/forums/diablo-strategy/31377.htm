&#62; this is what happened today, i was playing with this guy (dont wanna 
&#62; mention his name). he knew nothing of this game. a level 10 warrior. 
&#62; he was legit though, i ll give him that. after awhile i thought he 
&#62; was ok and asked him if he wanna join my clan, he said, no thx im a 
&#62; leader of a clan. then i thought hmmm maybe this guy is koo. he 
&#62; insist that i check his web page out and it was something geocities, 
&#62; the really slow web pages... well geocities is already slow enough 
&#62; and on top of that, he had all these pics on it. i skip all that and 
&#62; wanna check out his clan and members. i clicked on members and i see 
&#62; nothing, so i thought maybe he doesn't list them. so i asked him how 
&#62; many members? after a slight pause, he said 2. i was... &#37;$&^*&# 
&#62; 
&#62; u call that a clan? and i advice him to give it up and he didn't take 
&#62; it that well and just left. 
&#62; 
&#62; an advice to all u out there who wants to or have a clan. if u dont 
&#62; have time and if ur not dedicated to build a clan give it up! merge 
&#62; with some other clan, it ll do u and ur members a favor! this is what 
&#62; gives these clan a bad name. these new clans comes up and they go. so 
&#62; their members starts to build friends and trust in the clan, and 
&#62; their leaders give up. leaving these poor legit members hanging. 
&#62; 
&#62; if u have 2 members in ur so call clan, pls dont call it a clan.

     DarkSniper,

     I have read all the threads on this post, and EVERYONE has valid 
points... But for the most part they're moot.

     Yes, him starting a guild when he doesn't know much about Diablo 
could be disastrous for some newbies.  And yes he should be allowed 
to play the game the way he wants.

     I understand your wanting to save some newbies pain (I was one 
once &#60;grin&#62;), but, if he really wants to go through with his 
clan, who are you to criticize him? You can point out that it might 
not be a good idea until he's more experienced, but browbeating it 
into him is NOT going to make it easier to take.

     As for all the debeting on cheating/cheaters and the flames 
flying back and forth, I don't know whether that's personal or not... 
So I wont comment on it.

     DarkSniper, think of it this way: When Diablo first came out, 
everyone was legit because nobody knew of or had any cheats.  Then 
people started finding them, which made the legits, unable to compete 
with the godly cheaters, form guilds and start playing private games. 
(BTW: I am not criticising guilds, I find the idea great... I'm just 
saying that cheaters have made people even more aware that they need 
people they can trust) Now, if we take this a step further and 
imagine your game:

     DarkSniper and (GuildLeader) are in a game. GuildLeader's guild 
is smaller and can't compete with DarkSniper's guild. Hence, 
GuildLeader either must conform to DarkSniper's standards or retreat 
to somewhere safe...

     Looked at another way:

     GuildLeader (Legits) is unable to compete with DarkSniper 
(cheaters) and must conform.

     AGAIN, I AM NOT CALLING YOU A CHEATER OR IMPLYING ANYTHING OF 
THE SORT.  I am just pointing out the similarities.  When confronted 
with a greater power, anyone can cave in. Don't tell me you might not 
have when you where starting your guild :).

     In conclusion, DS, all I'm trying to say is that you and 
everyone else is entitled to your own opinions, but your NOT entitled 
to ram them down someone else's throat :).

     Let the man play the way he wants to play.
