<pre>Greetings,
    There have been many recent posts debating &#34;cheating vs 
legits&#34; etc, but I think most of them are too long and boring to 
read, so I'll be very blunt, nonphilosophical and down to the point 
with this post.

1. Diablo is a game.  Play it and have fun.  Play it however you have 
fun. If you are not having fun play it another way.

 I have fun playing without cheating.  I find fun in getting new 
items, gaining levels, working with others to achieve a common goal, 
and other reasons.

2.  You can't STOP people from cheating as long as people want to.  
All you can do is educate people, give them the facts, then let them 
make a choice.  It is the same thing with smoking.  Give them the 
facts and give them the CHOICE.

3.  If you don't like cheating join a noncheating guild/clan.

4.  Insulting and attacking cheaters doesn't make you any better than 
them.  It may give you a false sense of righteousness, but your 
spirit will be just as empty/full or emptier than it was before your 
attack.

5.  Cheaters are people just like noncheaters/legits

6.  Diablo is meant for a MATURE gamer, many cheaters/legits are not 
mature enough to place this game in PERSPECTIVE

7.  Visit my Diablo site at
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/5701">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/5701</a>

any typos/bad grammar were intentional becuz i am very tired.
