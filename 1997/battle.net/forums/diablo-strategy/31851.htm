<pre>[please forgive me for maybe starting a thread, but ... :-)]

&#62; With all this in mind, i choose the warrior as the best class. Why? 
&#62; because as the game goes on its harder for him to play and strategy 
&#62; becomes much more important. 

I can only agree. I think the warrior is the best class. Here are my 
reasons:

1. The warrior can play all levels solo and beat the baddies and the 
game never gets too hard / too annoying. Yes, he has problems with 
the soul burners / advocates on hell/hell, but these are about the 
only monsters I really fear with my level 40 warrior. But you can 
always stone them and when I beat them up with my KSOS, they are 
finished quite fast. 

2. On the other hand, the other classes have problems with many 
monsters. The rogue is a close up second to the warrior - she has to 
carry around quite good equipment to live in hell. My rogue is level 
39, soon 40, carries about the same equipment as my warrior (except 
for Eaglehorn instead of the KSOS and a godly shield) and she has 
about 30 AC less than him and 100 hits less. Remember: my warrior 
goes to hell/hell regularly and laughs about nightmare/hell, but my 
rogue has problems in nightmare/hell and can't do hell/hell alone. 
The monsters I fear the most are Blood Knights and Azure Drakes (and 
of course Soul Burners and Lava Maws). When there are too many of 
them so that my rogue gets stuck in a group of them, they want to see 
quite a bunch of healing potions - and if there are more thany four 
or five azure drakes, my rogue get _really_ stuck and can do nothing 
but &#34;teleport or die&#34;. Yes - you should not let your rogue 
get surrounded by enemies, but use ranged attacks instead. But what 
can you do if you play hell alone and get into a room with twenty 
enemies ? But I like the mana/magic capabilities of the rogue. 
Nevertheless, the rogue is - from my point of view - inferior to the 
warrior when used as a solo character. Now to the Mage: I never 
understood how a mage could survive hell/hell alone - after all, 
there _are_ monsters with &#34;immune to all&#34;, so that the only 
tactic available is &#34;stone and beat up&#34; or &#34;stone, golem 
and beat up&#34;. But how you could do this when the mage does only 
about say 40-50 damage/hit (with a _really_ good weapon - not with 
the dreamflange most seem to use) was beyond me until some days ago. 
I met a player who is a real mage fanatic and I asked him how he was 
able to do hell/hell alone. He said &#34;well, of course these 
monsters are a problem. So I don't even bother killing them, but 
instead I teleport around, looking for the stairs down, so I can skip 
the level&#34;. So much for doing hell/hell alone. When I talk about 
&#34;doing hell/hell&#34; I mean of course &#34;killing all the 
monsters and getting all the items&#34;. Apparently, the mage cannot 
do that - or, if you try it, it takes a _really_ long time (stoning 
everybody, hitting one of them for about twenty to fourty times till 
he dies, stoning everybody again, beating up the next one, ...). 

3. When rating the classes after their capabilities for co-op play, 
the warrior stands out again - because he simply cannot do 
&#34;friendly fire&#34;. I have met only one or two mages who were 
fun to play with. All others enter the dungeon and set their chain 
lightning switch to &#34;on&#34;, not bothering that their warrior 
friends drop dead around them. Or, worse, they wait until the warrior 
goes hand-to-hand with a knight, then they start &#34;helping&#34; 
with fireballs. The few mages who were OK either went their own way 
or they stood there, stoning everybody in sight. Both isn't the kind 
of cooperation which is the most fun ... Rogues sometimes are really 
OK to play with, but only if the player is very experienced and knows 
_where_ he should shoot and _when_. Otherwise rogues can be really 
annoying. Warriors on the other hand are _always_ OK to play with - 
except when it's a cheater who takes away all the monsters.
The games on battle.net which I remember as the best were always 
games where all players had a warrior as their character.

just my 0.02.  -  I know that most battle.net - players seem to 
prefer mages (at least I get this impression when I follow the 
threads), but I really never understood WHY. Maybe somebody can 
explain it to me - I am really interested.</pre>
