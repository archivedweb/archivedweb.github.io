<pre>Here are my opinions on cheating, I appreciate feedback on whether or 
not you people agree, or disagree with my thoughts, so here goes:


1.)  Using any program that alters your character IS cheating (ex:  
raising exp, gold, stats, spell levels, or adding items)

2.)  Backing up/Restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating, and 
I am not going to use the old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse.  In 
single player Diablo, if you get your ass whipped by some demons, all 
you have to do is restore from your last save, well, there is NO 
reason that multiplayer should be any different, especially with the 
added risk of pkillers, and the like.

3.)  Transferring characters to/from single player and multiplayer is 
NOT cheating.  If the character has not been altered by external 
programs, or hacked in some way, then this transfer is perfectly 
legitimate, after all, why should someone spend weeks, building up a 
single player character, just to find out that if they want to play 
multiplayer, then they will have to start all over from level 1!

4.)  In multiplayer games, high-level players, giving things to lower 
level characters is alright, IF they are normally obtainable by that 
lower level player, such as a level 20 rouge, giving a level 5 
warrior a few healing potions, but it should not be takken too far!  
Such as giving a plate of armor that the lower level character would 
not have access to for levels to come.  I am sick and tired of seeing 
extremely low level characters such as levels 1-12 having Godly 
plates of the Whale, and Obsidian rings of the Zodiac, and Dragon's 
amulets of the zodiac, and King's swords of haste, these things are 
EXTREMELY rare and should not be found untill really high levels, I 
get on B-net all the time, and I always see this, level 1-12 people 
having better equipment than me (level 16 Warrior), and you know 
someone just gave it to them.

5.)  Dupping IS cheating.  If people did not dupe, then the problem 
in #4 would not exist, if King's swords of haste were as rare as they 
SHOULD be, NOBODY would be giving them away.

6.)  Also, using a program such as a Trainer, that can grant immunity 
to other players attacks is NOT cheating (unless dueling of coarse) 
because of the vast number of dumbshit PKers that are out there, one 
HAS to protect oneself.

I appreciate you time and efforts of reading this, and possible 
posting of a response.  I am in no way shape or form showing 
disrespect to anyone, or out to offend anyone, so I hope I have not 
done so.

Sincerely,
Anonymouse (Level 16 Warrior)</pre>
