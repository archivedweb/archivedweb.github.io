Dear Merrilee,

First of all, you WERE one of hellbounds friends.  As for being to 
hell/hell, yes you are correct we did do hell/hell together, once.  
My level 39 mage and your level 36 rogue kicked butt even with some 
really incredible lags.  I do believe I remember you retreating quite 
a bit though.  As for doing it solo, I believe you did level 13 and 
then quit because it was to tough and not worth it.  As for the 
uncivilized, piggish, barbaric nature of the overconfident sorcerers, 
I think the comments were in line with what Blizzard intended.  The 
rogue is virtually naked when without armor.  The mage has a full 
length robe when without armor and the warrior is also fully clothed. 
 Now you tell me if Blizzard didn't want and expect comments about a 
naked rogue.  Just one more of the many attractions of the game.  My 
advice to you rogues is, if you don't like someone looking, then 
don't blatently flaunt it.  Finally, as for watching me get brought 
down a peg, I know I die more often than you do.  I don't mind dying 
at all.  A lot of players don't like dying.  I could care a less.  If 
I'm not dying then the game isn't challenging.  As an example, my 
hell/hell trick of getting everything around and in laz's chamber 
activated, tleporting to a corner and attempting to take everything 
out before dying.  Yes, laz unexpectedly teleported out and took me 
out with some well placed fireballs while I was surrounded by a horde 
of nasties.  It was fun and after laz smoked me three more times when 
I came down naked, I finally had everything killed and got my stuff 
back.  Without death and a consequence of death, the game is boring.  
It becomes a hunt for items in which everything is random.  Bring 
your weak arrows on anytime you like.  Luckily there are adventurous 
rogues like the Code man that aren't afraid of dying or hell/hell.

Hellbound

P.S.  I beleive on my first adventure into hell/hell I was either a 
level 31 or 32 mage.  I got to the laz level and died at the stairs 
with a group of soul burners around me.  I lost everything as after 
about the tenth attempt at killing them I quit accidentally instead 
of restarting in town.  Now I know that the soul burners are immune 
to all.  You may feel that I was being stupid, I on the other hand 
enjoy a challenge with a consequence.  Anytime you want to duel me, 
just bring it on.  Oh yeah, that's right you did challenge my level 
31 warrior to a duel with your level 37 rogue.  Tough guy your not.</pre>
