&#62;    OK, I missed the last couple of days on the forum while getting my 
&#62; car repaired, so I didn't have much chance to be in on the big 
&#62; debates. So, with apologies to Kramer and Lorax, I'd like to toss in 
&#62; my 2$'s worth. (Inflation, y'know?)
&#62; 
&#62;   This is something I've been thinking about for a long time now, and 
&#62; I've gotta get it out. Lots of people seem to think only in terms of 
&#62; Good/Bad, Legit/Cheat, Co-op/PK. Each duality is considered the same 
&#62; (ie Good=Legit=Co-op; Bad=Cheat=PK), but I think we really need to 
&#62; think along two axis instead of one. I once played a great deal of 
&#62; AD&D, and Diablo has a lot of similarities to the old tabletop 
&#62; classic. So, what I'm considering here is a WHOLE NEW idea: using the 
&#62; AD&D alignment system to kill two birds with one stone: (1) quickly 
&#62; divide people up into those you do(n't) want to play with, and (2) 
&#62; make cheating part of the roleplaying experience available to Diablo 
&#62; players. First off, Legit/Cheat isn't about good and evil, it's about 
&#62; following the rules. Thus, Lawful and Chaotic are the new terms of 
&#62; the day. Co-op/PK can be described as good and evil, though. Either 
&#62; you work with people, or you prey upon them. Even this isn't iron-
&#62; clad, however; remember duelling, self-defense, and avenging honor 
&#62; are &#34;good&#34; reasons for player killing.
&#62; 
&#62; Some examples, which may be construed as &#34;picking on&#34; if you 
&#62; wish, although such is not my intent.
&#62; 
&#62;    Lawful Good: DarkSniper, obviously. Also, however remember that 
&#62; less verbose posters also qualify as LG, just because you don't 
&#62; preach a sermon, doesn't mean you can't keep the faith.
&#62;    Lawful Neutral: I've yet to see this creature. Stays away from 
&#62; cheats, but has no compunctions against wasting a fellow player, 
&#62; especially if they are annoying in some manner. May attack from 
&#62; suprise, but probably won't.
&#62;    Lawful Evil: The image projected by the Priests of Chaos guild. 
&#62; They don't cheat, but they'll use every trick in the book to kill 
&#62; other players. I can respect that. (Not that I'd knowingly play in a 
&#62; game with one.)
&#62;    Neutral Good: These are the newbie-helpers. They dupe things, or 
&#62; hand out unneeded items to new players. Or, perhaps, like myself, 
&#62; maintain back-ups in case of crashing.
&#62;    True Neutral: Haven't seen this person yet either. Probably just 
&#62; not interested in anything beyond single player, though.
&#62;    Neutral Evil: These are the people who like killing other players, 
&#62; and are just to that stage where it would be a little easier if they 
&#62; could dupe off that ring they found, or use Deye to pick easy 
&#62; targets. They stack the deck, but don't use marked cards . . . . yet.
&#62;    Chaotic Good: Code Myster. He uses the cheats, he admits to it, 
&#62; and isn't ashamed of it. But, he doesn't hurt other players, so good 
&#62; for him.
&#62;    Chaotic Neutral: This guy doesn't play Diablo, he plays SNES games 
&#62; with a game genie. He wants every advantage possible, and doesn't 
&#62; care to bother with other players either way.
&#62;    Chaotic Evil: The scum of battlenet. Godmode PKers. TownKillers. 
&#62; These are the people who use Raymond's Trainer to cripple your 
&#62; character, then copy all your items, then let you get monster killed 
&#62; in Laz's chamber. STAY AWAY!
&#62; 
&#62;    Some of you probably think this post is a little silly, and I 
&#62; agree, it is a little silly. But then, having a huge, hostile fight 
&#62; over a computer game is a little silly as well. Thanks for reading 
&#62; this far.

I guess that puts me at Neutral Good philosophically (in gaming 
anyway), with style of play ranging +/- a little on the Law/Chaos
axis depending on my mood and the preferences of the people
I play with.  (Hey, I've lost my char twice due to no fault of mine,
and recovered her once.  I'm backing up.  If you won't play with
me because of that, fine, you go your way, I'll go mine)

Interesting to think about back when I was playing AD&D (and
D&D before that!).  I tended towards the Chaotic Good, with
characters who enjoyed tweaking those stuffy lawful good
types when they hit those uncomfortable moral grey areas.
I guess I've both mellowed and become more lawful as I got
older.
