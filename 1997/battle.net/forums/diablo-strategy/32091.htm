<pre>I tried this a while back in church, cats, and caves.  It worked in 
caves, but not in church or cats.  I wonder if I was wearing the 
jewelry when I went down. Hmmmm.....  Why should that matter, I 
wonder.

Also, I wonder what this looks like when you play in multiplayer.  If 
one player has +50&#37; light and another has -50&#37; light, does it 
cancel each other out, or does one player see a bright screen while 
the other player sees a dark screen.  If the second case was true, it 
would be like using an invisibility spell.  Cool.

&#62; I know there are those who will not want to read this post or even 
&#62; hear about what I'm about to post. For those in this group, do not

&#62; 
&#62; I am about to discuss the most amazing strategy I have seen yet in 
&#62; Diablo. It makes the game so *EASY* that it is possible for a newbie 
&#62; to enter Hell Hell and beat EVERYTHING without armor or even advanced 
&#62; weapons.
&#62; 
&#62; This is unethical to the point of cheating... but it's legal, uses no 
&#62; cheats, no hacked items ... nothing but a simple strategy. It has 
&#62; forever changed my view of Diablo knowing how easy it is to kill 
&#62; EVERYTHING ... it's facinating yet depressing.
&#62;

&#62; Ok, so you want to know what it is eh? I have seen at least 2 other 
&#62; posts on this concept in this forum over the past month or two. I'm 
&#62; not claiming I came with it either, but I did run enough experiments 
&#62; last night to add insight into the base idea.
&#62; 
&#62; All this came about because I tried to beat Diablo last night in Hell 
&#62; Hell with my Rogue. Nothing out of the norm about that, however I 
&#62; wanted to do it NAKED!!! That's right, NO ARMOR!!!! No Plate, Mail, 
&#62; Leather or anything. A naked Sorcerer can do quite well but how would 
&#62; a naked Rogue fair? I was SHOCKED by the outcome.
&#62; 
&#62; The basic premis I used was this: Creatures get &#34;activated&#34; 
&#62; by the &#34;light&#34; casted out by your player. The larger the 
&#62; light radius casted by your player, the more creatures you can 
&#62; activate as you move. By using Rings of Darkness, I wanted to make my 
&#62; light radius as small as possible and hence allowing me to get closer 
&#62; to creatures without activating them.  
&#62; 
&#62; With two rings of Darkness in my inventory, I dumped all my armor and 
&#62; spare items in town, loaded up on mana and headed to hell. When I got 
&#62; down, I put on the rings and WOW did it get *DARK*! It was really 
&#62; errie. I used one of a million Infra scrolls I had and started off 
&#62; slowly. The level contained Doom Guards and Lava Maw's. I had 
&#62; intended on getting close to a creature, stoning them and shooting 
&#62; them with my bow.
&#62; 
&#62; What happened you asked? I got my A** Kicked!!!! I was overcome in a 
&#62; blink of an eye and found myself back in town. I started back down, 
&#62; moved slowly and used 8 belt potions in Chain Lighting effectivly 
&#62; killing everything. I got both Darkness Rings and continued even more 
&#62; slowly. As creatures poured out at me, I chained them. It was a Mana 
&#62; intensive level but I got through it without dying again. It was 
&#62; weird though... the creatures seemed to be activated beyond my 
&#62; &#34;light radius&#34; (I found out why later).
&#62; 
&#62; After trip to town to repair Windy and get mana, I continued down to 
&#62; level 14. I again moved extremely slowly not wanting a repeat of 
&#62; level 13. It was wierd, I could walk up EXTREMELY close to creatures 
&#62; now! I stoned the Hell Spawn and shot them easy as pie. There were 
&#62; Guards there not immune to fire... it was AMAZING, as they were not 
&#62; moving, 1 fireball would kill 3 at a time! Not only that, it did not 
&#62; &#34;wake up&#34; the creatures standing next to the ones who died! 
&#62; It was SO easy! I did not die once on this level. I had to return to 
&#62; town to repair Windy again as well as get more mana.
&#62; 
&#62; As nothing moved when I got close, I was able to &#34;practice&#34; 
&#62; my Stone Curse and Arrow aiming. I have heard TONZ of people give 
&#62; their ideas on where to &#34;aim&#34; to increase your chances of 
&#62; hitting a creature... you know what?? They are all WRONG! I can now 
&#62; stone ANY single char out of a huge group each and every time. It was 
&#62; staggering to me to know in all this time, I had been aiming 
&#62; incorrectly. 
&#62; 
&#62; I learned something else staggering to me, as I used Windforce, a bow 
&#62; with Knockback, sometimes stray arrows would activate hellspawn off 
&#62; of the screen. Their AI tells them to come directly to me, regardless 
&#62; if they can see me or not. They would approach until they reached my 
&#62; &#34;light radius&#34; and would crouch down to fire. 1 shot from 
&#62; them would &#34;confuse&#34; them and they would wander back and 
&#62; forth across the light radius threshold. I found I could activate 
&#62; lots of hell spawn and only shoot them when they crouched down to 
&#62; fire. Hit them once and it would take them 4-5 sec to crouch back 
&#62; down, and give me time to kill others. It was easy! Also, I noticed 
&#62; that if I teleported only a few &#34;squares&#34; away, enough that 
&#62; my light radius did not hit them, they would instantly &#34;loose 
&#62; me&#34; even though I was still near them. I never had to retreat 
&#62; far, only a few squares!
&#62; 
&#62; I continued to level 15, even more confident now of my new found 
&#62; &#34;skills&#34;
&#62; Level 15 was a CAKEWALK with 1 exception. I was standing in a room 
&#62; that bordered another room filled with creatures. I was far enough 
&#62; away that even with my normal light radius, I would not have 
&#62; activated them.
&#62; 
&#62; I tinkered with my ring configuration trying to come up with a better 
&#62; mix of stuff. I ended up sticking with my original configuration and 
&#62; continued into the next room. NEARLY EVERYTHING WAS ACTIVATED WHEN I 
&#62; ENTERED THE ROOM! I jumped into a portal and went to town for more 
&#62; mana and to think about why all of a sudden the creatures were 
&#62; activated beyond the light radius as in the first level of hell. 
&#62; Suddenly I realized the answer. You *HAVE* to be wearing the darkness 
&#62; rings when you ENTER the level! I repaired Windy, got more mana and 
&#62; started back down the portal ready for a quick retreat if I was 
&#62; wrong. I wasn't. All the creatures were just standing there again 
&#62; (btw: light from the portal did not seem to effect them). I quickly 
&#62; cleared them out and went for laz. I was able to walk in the middle 
&#62; of his area, kill everything but him without a shot at me. After 
&#62; taking care of him, I headed to 16.
&#62; 
&#62; I took another trip to town for mana and repairs then started 
&#62; clearing 16. It was EASY! They never fired a shot! It was sometime 
&#62; around here that it dawned on me to take a screen cap (damn, sorry 
&#62; everyone, standing in laz's room would have been cool). Anyway here 
&#62; are some screen caps. You can click on them right now to view (direct 
&#62; pictures, not my page):

&#62; #1) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen03.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen03.gif</a>
&#62; This is me entering the upper left room in 16. (don't look at my cute 
&#62; butt!)
&#62; 
&#62; #2) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen04.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen04.gif</a>
&#62; Farther in same room.
&#62; 
&#62; #3) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen05.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen05.gif</a>
&#62; entering D's sq. I got careless and activated the two Knights (btw: 
&#62; notice the wierd refresh on the mana as I was hit in the middle of 
&#62; the screen cap).
&#62; 
&#62; #4) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen06.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen06.gif</a>
&#62; Knights killed, nobody else see's me.
&#62; 
&#62; #5) <a href="http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen07.gif">http://www.burgoyne.com/pages/dchriste/temp/screen07.gif</a>
&#62; Everyone dead but Diablo. I teleported only this far away. He can't 
&#62; see me. The other light is from where Gorash died.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway it was an eye opener for me. It was SO easy it is pitiful. The 
&#62; only drawback with this method is that #1) you need around 2-4 infra 
&#62; scrolls per level and #2) heaps of mana (which you need ANYWAY in a 
&#62; hell hell run).
&#62; 
&#62; If a level 1 player was carefull with stray arrows, he could easily 
&#62; clear hell hell alone with no armor. It's facinating yet sorta 
&#62; depressing. Throw away your armor folks, you don't need it. You only 
&#62; need 2 rings of Darkness which only cost 1 gold piece a piece.
