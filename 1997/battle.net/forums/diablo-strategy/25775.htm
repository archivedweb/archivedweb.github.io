<pre>I was in the caves yesterday with my rogue (Royce lvl 18) and there 
were two other warriors with me.  One of the warriors turned on the 
other and started hacking.  The guy quickly died.  I asked what was 
going on (personal vendetta, pk, bounty hunter, etc...) but the guy 
started coming after me.  I shot him with my arrows and easily dodged 
his fireballs.  I was in an area with a big rock, so I just circled 
it, fired at him, and kept dodging his stuff.  Boy, HE SUCKED!!!  All 
he had to do was put up some firewalls on one side, and come after 
me, but like an idiot, he just kept chasing me, and once in a while, 
change directions.  He was so bad, that I had lots of time to 
ridicule his tactics while fighting him.  I also warned others that 
joined.  Eventually, he must have had enough and left.  My arrows, by 
the way, hit him constantly, but his hit points never went down 
(Surprise, a cheater!)

My question is this.  Is it your experience that all these cheaters 
(god mode or otherwise) can't play well.  I've run across a few 
cheater/pk's  and they usually stink in their play.  It seems, they 
are only successful when they attack surprise attack.  Are there 
cheaters out there that consider their ability, above average?  Just 
wondering.</pre>
