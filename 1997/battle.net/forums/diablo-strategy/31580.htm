<pre>&#62; What I've came across every time I play is a level 30 + character who 
&#62; thinks that it's really cool to dump tons of rings, armor, money ... 
&#62; in the square village to get you started.
   They THINK they're helping you, but . . .

&#62; My dumb level one character ended up with over 200 hit points, 
&#62; 140&#37; hit and max resistance to all magic in a matter of seconds, 
&#62; needles to say he could go down through the first levels and chop 
&#62; away every thing in sight with no hassle.
&#62; I finally sacrificed him because it just didn't feel right.
  Good for you--I also hope that you realized how boring it was
going to get real quick--there really was no challenge!!

&#62; I'm still looking for a group of level 1-3 people that believe in a 
&#62; real adventure and would like to tie up a sense of team spirit.
&#62; Maybe I'm dreaming and that just doesn't happen in todaya virtual 
&#62; electronic world..
&#62; The conned and killed, Uhl Bok
  Bok--I've been playing multiplayer Diablo for a while, but not on 
battlenet.  Even though I have a couple of high-level characters, I'd
be interested in playing some low-level games, too.  (Rogue is my 
class of choice; I also play a good warrior.  I suck at multi 
wizards!)  I can't get on bnet often, at least not until we get online
at home.  If you're still looking for another player, email me at
SUSALKA@ZEKE.ENET.DEC.COM   I'll probably get on bnet tonight , maybe
9:30 eastern time--I'll be looking for DarkSniper, but if I don't find
him, feel free to look me up.  Check out channel Boots first.  If 
you join, I'll quit and restart a new character!

Hope you find your way to hell with some quality gamers!!

fight the good fight,
Boots

   Mordenkainen--l16 wizard (solo-multi)
     All 150&#37; legit!!</pre>
