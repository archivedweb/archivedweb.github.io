&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62;  If you want to participate in this survey, please answer the 
&#62; questions *BEFORE* you read other peoples replies (in order to 
&#62; preserve answers). I want each of your opinions.
&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; This is a simple survey of what people concider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; is or is not, cheating.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

It's not cheating if the gold is legal.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

Yes, if the low level char is a newbie...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

Yes, if the low level char is a newbie...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

Yes, if the low level char is a newbie. Read my comment on the end of 
the page...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

Actually it might not be very fair if the low level char could have 
sone it himself. He could have used the exp. better that the hight 
level player.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?

I don't think so. It's... shopping! Everyone goes shopping ;)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

Yes, Deye is a cheat programm. Every not-Diablo software used in 
Diablo is a cheat-program. And if you want to spot cheaters, keep 
your own eyes open. They might do something obviously cheateresque.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

I think it is. They aren't sopposed to be there, thats why they can't 
access this place regularly. It would be cheating to allow them to be 
there...

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
items?

I see my storage chars as my... slaves... hehehe. They have to carry 
all my old and good stuff so I don't have to sell it or give it away. 
I think nearly everyone with more than 4 chars has at least one 
storage char... wait, just because I do it, and others do it, doesn't 
mean its not cheating.. hmm. So, I just don't think storage chars are 
cheating!

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

All characters of one player can be seen a a team. It would not be 
cheating to let them exchange their equipment, it actually helps 
everyone, and as long as the equipment is legit, equipment transfer 
is legit too!

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

If the Nova spell is contained in staff for scroll form with limited 
(and below 255) charges, it would not be cheating. But also not very 
good PKing...
 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

No, it's just very mean.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

It is. Only Healing, Heal Other and Resurrect are allowed in town, 
teleporting in town is cheating.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

It's not cheating. Since system crashes aren't a part of the game 
(or..are they?), it is not cheating to avoid character lossed they 
might produce. However it would be severe cheating to restore the 
chars after being PKed. 


I answered honestly... and now a note:

All questions about a high level char helping a low level char can be 
answered quite simple: It is by all means cheating to spoil the 
experience of being a helpless low level char that has to rely on 
startegy more that good equipment.
Giving a a mail to a newbie that never even saw one, should be 
considered cheating. I think every newbie has the right to get all 
the different items by himself, it would not be fun at all to know 
all kinds of items after one week of playing.

On the other hand, I wouldn't consider giving items to low level 
chars cheating, if the player has already got one or more legal chars 
on high levels and so surely knows how to play Diablo. I would call 
it even less cheating to give a player good items that has lost one 
or several high level chars during to the infamous system crashes and 
has to start from zero...
