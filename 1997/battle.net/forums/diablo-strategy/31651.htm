&#62; now other than an obs amulet of zod i cant think of anything that 
&#62; would make this mage better. do u have any suggestions?

If you want to play a sorcerer in it's purest form I'd say get Naj's 
light plate.  I still have a problem with the sorcerer's being able 
to wear the heavy plate.  These guys are suppose to be fairly weak 
physically and are suppose to rely on their inate magic ability to 
survive.  In Diablo they are simply too powerful.  The fire ball is 
so strong that it precludes the use of any other spell except on fire 
immune's and the sight of fully armed and armored mages charging into 
fights and going toe to toe alarms any role playing game enthusiast.  
Naj's, while being plate, is specifically designed for the mage so I 
don't have a problem with it.  Then again Blizzard allowed the use of 
heavy plate so use it if you like that's just my opinion.

PS My sorcerer does have Naj's (given to him by my rogue) and I will 
continue to use it.

PPS That is one awsome set of awsome plate (no pun intended) I've 
been looking for that set up with my rogue for a long time.  Best 
I've done is saintly full of percision.  Congrats on finding that one!</pre>
