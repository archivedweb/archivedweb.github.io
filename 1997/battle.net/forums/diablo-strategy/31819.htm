<pre>All the other tips are good. I'd like to clear up something
about the lighting and chain lighting spell.

The damage listed for these spells are much lower than the
damage listed for fireball. But the lighting spells work
differently.

Fireball does full damage to the targets in the center of the
blast and does less (half damage i think) to targets at the
perimeter of the blast. I think The blast area also increases
as the level of the spell increases.

The damage done by lighting is per segment of the lighting that
hits the target. The number of segments increases as the level
of the spell increases (longer strand of lighting). Lighting
damages all targets in it's path, not just the first target; so
try to line up the baddies before you zap away.

With chain lighting, you get one strand per level. CL will target
monsters off the screen and behind walls (monsters behind walls
will not take damage). This means you will activate most monsters
in the vicinity when you use CL. So be prepared for them.

I love to use CL when I'm solo, nothing clears an area faster.
But CL is a bad thing to use when you're playing with others for
they can get fried also.

If you think CL is expensive, wait till you use the stone curse/
golem combo to take care of the immune-alls.

Hope this clears things up.

&#62; Yes yes, I know Saint Michael was a warrior, but I couldn't help but 
&#62; experiment with the mage class so I made one.  He's about 29th level, 
&#62; and what I want are some suggestions for items I should be searching 
&#62; for.  Right now here are some of the stats/items I can remember.
&#62; 
&#62; Awesome Plate (+136&#37; AC 49)
&#62; Drake's (Long) Staff of Wizardry (+40 mana, +30 magic)
&#62; Awesome Helm of Sorcery (+130&#37; AC 6 +20 Magic)
&#62; Ring of Zodiac (+19 all)--best item of the bunch--
&#62; Ring of Wizardry (+30 magic)
&#62; Amulet of Titans(+26 Strength) &#60;--how do you think I wore plate?:)
&#62; 
&#62; the sorceror (Djinn) has over 500 mana, and a good assortment of 
&#62; spells.  I know many players  use the DreamFlange/Stormshield 
&#62; approach, but I do NOT want to sacrifice +30 magic for a stupid mace 
&#62; and fastblock shield.  I still have another 120 magic to go before I 
&#62; max out, too. (250 is maxed right?)
&#62; 
&#62; I have also noticed that my CL spell costs me about 28 mana to cast.  
&#62; In comparison, Fireball costs 10 and does 10 times the damage(ok, not 
&#62; quite, but follow my point here).  What level CL do you have to have 
&#62; to lower that spell costs??  Every book I get lowers the cost by an 
&#62; excruciatingly small 1 mana.  Damage increase is minimal.  Is there 
&#62; some point where it starts making a bigger difference to get CL 
&#62; books??  At this rate, the least it will cost is about 20.  When I 
&#62; get in scraps with SoulBurners, and the like, I have to really pump 
&#62; out the lightnin to kill em.  That bleeds the mana like a bucket with 
&#62; a hole in it.  I end up spending more on mana pots than I am picking 
&#62; off the ground (ok..another exaggeration..but you get the idea) 
&#62; 
&#62; Another thing, how do you higher end mages deal with triple immunes.  
&#62; I have read of people using melee weapons, but it seems unreasonable. 
&#62;  My mage swings a sword like a decrepit grandmother.  How am I to 
&#62; deal with these immune bastards?  My AC isn't the best on the planet, 
&#62; but mages aren't supposed to have great AC (I think mine is around 
&#62; 130).  My &#37; to hit is sickening (94&#37;) when attacking tougher 
&#62; creatures.  Djinn just swings and swings, as if fanning the demons to 
&#62; appease them.  
&#62; 
&#62; So...if you have suggestions?  I would like you guys to respond with 
&#62; some items I should be looking for to keep mana/magic up and some 
&#62; tactics to defeat these immune bastards, and possibly so ray of hope 
&#62; for an inexpensive CL.  Thank you for your time:):)
