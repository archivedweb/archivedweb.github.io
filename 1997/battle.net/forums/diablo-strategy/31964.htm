&#62; I have read several posts concerning random spawning of good items.  
&#62; It seems that the principle theory is that the date of your PC 
&#62; calander has something to do with it.
&#62; 
&#62; I have heard of several people claiming that May 29 has been 
&#62; especially good for them.
&#62; 
&#62; My own character has never had much luck.  Billy is currently level 
&#62; 32 and has only found perhaps 5 or 6 unique items (mostly junk).  
&#62; 
&#62; Does anyone know for sure how this random function works.  An idea I 
&#62; had is that it is a function of date and the ascii value of your 
&#62; character name.  This would be very easy to implement from a 
&#62; programming standpoint and also make everyone's &#34;Special Day&#34; 
&#62; different.
&#62; 
&#62; Who knows?
&#62; 
Who knows? The game programmers, and they made it so you're not 
supposed to know.  I find games a lot more fun when you just play 
them instead of trying to outsmart them.  But then again, that's just 
me...</pre>
