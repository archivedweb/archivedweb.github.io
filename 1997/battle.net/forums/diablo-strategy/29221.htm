<pre>At this point I have played mages to levels 31, 33, and 36, a rogue 
to level 35, and a couple warriors to levels 38 and 39.

The answer to your question depends upon what you like-

The character which levels the fastest is by far the mage. I just 
took one from Thurs afternoon to Sunday evening from 1 to level 33, 
legit (I restarted my Lok character as a mage, the old one was 
shrined). That is fast. You can't do that with a rogue or a warrior.

In terms of surviving hell/hell I would imagine the rogue has others 
beat. The rogue has the ranged attack to which nothing is immune 
(bow) and rogues have huge ac necessary to thrive there. Rogues have 
pretty good mana, enough to curse and clear with a bow. I have had 
high level rogues bail my butt out of many a nasty situation- they 
just get that ac up there and come in and chain over and over and 
over. Its like pulling teeth getting a mage through triple immune 
soul burners. You stone curse then sit there and wait while your 
golem polishes them off. Warriors in hell/hell have to walk very 
carefully. They only have enough mana for about 3 stone curses, and 
its easy to get swamped. The highest legit level character I have 
heard of was a 48th level warrior though, and I have been told by 
some warriors they have better luck than other classes in hell/hell.

If you like not being dependent upon gear, mage is for you. A naked 
mage still does well. Rogues and warriors rely upon good gear to 
survive. 

If you don't like clicking til your fingers fall off, rogue is not 
the class for you. It gets tiresome clicking over and over and over...

If you like a class where you can sit back, put your feet up, and 
just use one hand, warrior is for you. With a warrior and a vamp 
sword, you just set the spell to heal and hack, hack, heal, hack, 
hack heal...

Mages are interesting in that there is always something to look 
forward to at Adria's. You can in principal get all your spells to 
15th base level with a mage. It sure is nice reading a spellbook and 
not having to change all your clothes to read it, putting on magic 
adders. I know for warriors it gets boring fast. You get a lot of 
cash, and once your stats are maxed, there is not a lot you can do 
with it.

In terms of dueling any one of the classes can do well as long as you 
play to the strengths of the class. Warriors have such huge hp that 
they can lurk and wait for you in ambush with no mana shield. A 
warrior on you with his sword is a duel all over. I have heard of 
rogues with impossible to hit 400 ac's, but for the most part, most 
rogues are not in that category. For a wizard you must use all the 
spells in your repetoire to nail a rogue. Standing in the wide open 
and fireballing isn't going to do it. You must move fast with tp and 
hit, tp, hit...If you blindside a rogue you can take it out in a few 
shots with a wizard, but once that bow is on you its all over.

If you like playing open bnet as a legit player, mage is the class 
for you. If you get mkilled and lose all your crap, it just doesnt 
matter. You can wander about naked and have fun with a mage.

Presently I prefer a mage. I like all of the fun options open with 
spellcasting and the mana to do it. I like the roar of chain 
lightning, and golems wandering around pounding on things. I like 
having enough mana to make teleport a normal and viable means of 
transportation. I like having one color of potions in my belt (blue). 
I like how much easier it is to go get your stuff after a mob nails 
you with a mage. I like not having to lug about a spare set of stuff. 
I like being able to use apocolypse staves. I like the fact that my 
character has a masculine grunt. I like how I can really make a huge 
positive difference in a group with a mage.
