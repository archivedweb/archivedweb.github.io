&#62; well, this is starting to turn into a 24 hour debate between DS and 
&#62; co. vs. Code. 
&#62; 
&#62; DS, u need to stop trying to tell the world not to cheat. let them go 
&#62; as they please. did u read Lorax's post on the continuum? it was the 
&#62; most truthful and logical explanation to cheating and legitamacy. 
&#62; 
&#62; If a newbie wishes to cheat,  then who gives a crap! let him cheat. 
&#62; hes the one wasting $50 on a good game because he will get bored of 
&#62; diablo in a couple of weeks. and then maybe after hes gets bored, 
&#62; he'll realize that diablo will be fun again if he doesnt cheat. he 
&#62; will then hopefully turn away from cheating for good. a gain for u!
&#62; 
&#62; Another thing, why dont u at least respect Code for admiting he 
&#62; cheats? Have u ever looked at the view of cheating from Code's point 
&#62; of view? teleporting gets u across town faster, big deal (i dont 
&#62; really consider this cheating because it does not enhance the 
&#62; charater itself, it wont help him succeed in the game).many other 
&#62; examles like that. What drove Code to cheat, have u ever wondered 
&#62; that? why dont u ask him, then u might understand why he cheats?
&#62; 
&#62; Now, dont get me wrong, im not taking sides. i dont like the fact 
&#62; that Code does cheat, but at least he admits it. DS is a non cheater, 
&#62; i like that too. DS, u got your guild nice and large by now, and i 
&#62; commend u on that. it full of legit players, very good. keep it up! 
&#62; but dont start trying to change people. let them be they way they 
&#62; want to be. u will never change the entire diablo world to legit.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, i left my e-mail up there for u to e-mail me if u have comments, 
&#62; not to flame me. but, i dont go a &#60;bleep&#62; if u do. 
&#62; 
&#62;  i meant not to insult u, but to simply comment on u (a simple 
&#62; critique). Find your place in the continuum and stay there (i love 
&#62; that post Lorax!).
&#62; 
&#62;  just for the record, i only am not legit on one of my charaters, the 
&#62; rest r fully legit. Nobody's post convinced me to start fully legit 
&#62; charaters, i convinced myself (hint, hint DS). 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; And one more thing to those who r going to flame me, dont hate me 
&#62; because i have an opinion (whether u agree w/ it or not, all i ask is 
&#62; that u respect my opinion)
&#62; 
&#62; c-ya yall in channel forum at 8:00 pm est Saturday
