<pre>No offense to Lanhdanan, especially cause he just wrote this post to 
say thanks to others...

But what does he mean when he says:

&#62; Darksniper: I wasn't even going to transfer my character until you 
&#62; said that you didn't consider it cheating. 

Is Lanhdanan talking about transfering a single-player character to 
multiplayer?  If so, I don't see how that it wouldn't be cheating.

If using a backup program to restore a multiplayer character after a 
MK is considered cheating, then restoring a single-player game after 
a MK (which all single-players legitimately do) becomes cheating when 
that player is transferred over to multiplay.  

Strictly speaking, the transferred single-player character just 
hasn't gained his/her points, levels and equipment in the same risky 
and difficult conditions that are faced by the multiplayer character.

If I have misunderstood or misinterpreted what Lanhdanan was talking 
about, then I apologize profusely: sorry for misunderstanding and 
getting involved in something I really don't know anything about.

However, if Lanhdanan is talking about a transfer from single- to 
multiplay, then I'd be interesting in talking more about why such a 
transfer would or would not be considered &#34;cheating&#34;.</pre>
