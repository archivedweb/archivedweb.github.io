<pre>DarkSniper, 

To begin, I'd also like to commend you on an insightful post.  I love 
seeing that my post has brought some replys from those who agree with 
me, but it's also good that it has spurred some alternative points of 
view.  I can't say I'm surprised, though.  :-)

I'm sad to say, however, that I did take offense to one point in your 
post.  You suggested that ... well, maybe it's better to quote you 
... &#34;ur a person who would let the world corrupt and just sit 
there and do nothing.&#34;  Now, I'll give you that you followed that 
comment up with a polite subpoint, but the heart of it kind of hit 
below the belt.  Of course, this leads me to the rebuttal that you 
already guessed in your post.

Diablo is only a game.  I know that there have been some deep 
discussions about this point lately.  Here's my take on the issue.  
True, in some cases, the way a person plays a game reflects their 
real-life morals.  But I'd say the this is very rare.  As you said, 
Diablo is something of a RPG.  Role playing game.  Say the words 
aloud and listen to them. ... Role playing. ... RPG's are not an 
attempt to recreate true life.  They are an attempt to create a 
twisted version of it, where you can escape life and PLAY a ROLE that 
you can not or would not otherwise.   

In your argument, you are looking at my battlenet persona, pulling 
him out, and sticking him in real life.  I think this is absurd.  
Just for kicks, lets look at it the other way around.  Lets take my 
real life persona and put it in the game.  If I were REALLY in 
Tristram, what would I do?  I would probably run.  That's right, I'd 
grab my wife and get as far away from that god-forsaken place as I 
could.  I sure the hell wouldn't be down in the caves facing acid 
spitters!  I'm no green beret.  I wouldn't last a second against 
those monsters.  There are a lot of other people in the world that 
could do a much better job in the battle against evil.  What good 
would I be, to the cause or to my wife, if I were dead?  Now, that 
may sound like I'm a coward, but it's honest, and I would bet that 
99&#37; of the people on battlenet would do the same.  I'll agree 
that this argument is a stretch.  No doubt about that.  I hope it 
shows you, however, that your comparison is equally outrageous.

This is where your real-life arguements fall apart.  Just because I 
act one way on battlenet CERTAINLY doesn't mean that I am the same 
way in real life.  My apathy toward cheating on battlenet does not 
necessitate that I am apathetic about real life issues.

Your drug use analogy was good in that it clearly shows your 
intention is to help others.  I tell you, DarkSniper, I admire that 
greatly.  But, if this is really how you feel, I would give you a 
suggestion ... Take all of the energy that you have spent fighting 
cheating in Diablo, and apply it toward REALLY fighting drug abuse.  
You might make the real world a better place, and I'd argue that you 
might even enjoy Diablo more.

As for your descriptions about what you consider cheating and what 
you do not ... I say &#34;fine.&#34;  Frankly, I'm not sure why you 
even included them in your post.  So, you don't think that character 
back up is cheating.  Did you expect me to argue with you?  The whole 
point of my post is that everyone, including you, has different 
opinions about what is cheating and what is not.  You can draw the 
line in the sand wherever you want.  Just don't expect others to stay 
on your side of it.

In closing, I'll say that I agree with you on one point for sure.  We 
will never see eye to eye on this.  :-)  But, you know what?  We 
don't have to.  We can agree to disagree and be tolerant of each 
other.  :-)

P.S.  DarkSniper, I must apologize for my earlier statement about 
your style of writing.  I was trying to make a point in a twisted, 
and apparently ineffective, way.  I'm sorry if you took it 
personally.  Sometimes, though, especialy late at night, it does hurt 
my brain to try to read your posts.  8-p  But then, I guess that's MY 
shortcoming, not yours.  :-) </pre>
