<pre>Yah, I killed my beloved character, then resurrected her at level 1.  
I'm starting from scratch, and I will be 100&#37; legit all the way.  

Partly, I did it because I want to see if I can increase my spell 
levels by replaying the game again, this time focusing on looking for 
and buying books (and ignoring crap spells that I never use).

BUT, most importantly, I had reached level 36, and the game just 
wasn't as much fun anymore.  I killed Diablo on Hell/Hell; Normal 
Hell was a breeze, and the stuff I found wasn't as good as the stuff 
I already had.

So I deleted my character and restarted in a multiplayer game by 
myself.  It was great!!  I was actually scared of the skeletons in 
the church and was amazed how hard it was to kill everything and stay 
alive at the same time.

I cleaned out the first two levels by myself--including the Butcher!! 
(he killed me once, but then I trapped him in the stairwell down and 
let fly till he croaked).  :-)

It was the most fun I've had in a long time.  I realize now that the 
fun and the excitement were derived from risk, opportunity and 
possibility, not in being secure and complete.  I can't wait to do my 
20-30 levels all over again!!

Some may think I'm crazy, but it made Diablo exciting for me all over 
again.  I highly recommend it!!</pre>
