<pre>Hi Melissa,

	I took your advice and checked out <a href="http://www.moltenlava.com">http://www.moltenlava.com</a> and 
liked what I saw, although it did seem a bit overdone.  I joined 
about a week ago, and was accepted as of Thursday.  I have restarted 
my Royce character (Although I know I didn't have to) and have played 
once.  Since I was level 1 and started playing very late (11PM PST), 
there really wasn't anybody I could play with.  But there were 
between 8 to 15 people on the channel during the times I was logged 
on (11 to 1AM).  Good turnout.  I just wanted to say thanks.  I do 
have a few questions, but I don't feel that it would be wise to post 
it here.  Maybe on the ml forum, but that's a bit too flaky.</pre>
