&#62; i ve recieved a lot of post with disagreements with me lately. and 
&#62; most of them has a &#34;dont flame me back...&#34; somewhere in there 
&#62; post. now i d like to have a chance to explain to  u that i DO NOT 
&#62; flame people cos they disagree with me. i flame cheaters and people 
&#62; who insulted me. so pls feel free to post any sort of disagreement to 
&#62; my post. i admit i do get out of line sometimes, but if u know me , 
&#62; im like that.
&#62; 
&#62; i ve recieved a post that said &#34; u dont own this channel&#34;. 
&#62; now let me make this extremely clear. i DO NOT own this forum, if 
&#62; anyone owns this forum, its blizzard. just because i get replies 
&#62; (good and bad) from some of my posts, doesnt mean i own this forum. i 
&#62; post a lot because i have nothing better to do for now. say i have no 
&#62; life for all i care.is that a sin? if yes then i ll limit my post to 
&#62; 2 per day and not 2 per hour.
&#62; 
&#62; i respect everyones opinion in this forum (except codes because of 
&#62; some differences that i wont get into). and i dont expect everyone to 
&#62; agree with me. after all, i aint perfect. and i m bound to make 
&#62; mistakes. and if u think u can change my extremely stubborn mind, 
&#62; then pls do. i have nothing against that. but if u insult me in ur 
&#62; post, pls do expect to get something back.
&#62; 
&#62; i stand up for what i believe, and if i dont agree with someone, i 
&#62; make it clear that i disagree with him or her. and if u cant take it, 
&#62; then just treat my post as if it wasnt there. i do give my opinion 
&#62; very bluntly but pls forgive me in advance that i m a person who 
&#62; hates to go around the bushes.

i respect you snipe.sure,sometimes you do get a holier than thou 
attitude but i still enjoy reading your posts and agree with most 
everything you say.you speak what is on your mind and don't care what 
anyone thinks.
