<pre>I couldn't possibly agree more with you.. I was offered and happened 
to find the absolutely best items when in my late 20's, while now, 
being L37 Rogue, 9 out of 10 times I'm offered prefix only / suffix 
only items..

And yes, I was offered my Awesome Full Plate Armor (AC75, +143&#37; 
AC I think) of the Lion (+49?? HP) when in L29.. 

I'll probably make some Nightmare/Hell runs carrying only my max 
resistances staff and a medium bow, and test this theory..

I'll let you know of the results :)

T-----s, L37 Rogue (101&#37; legit, didn't buy a Super bow once 
because I didn't have the money.. resisted my urge to duplicate and 
sell)

&#62; After reading Code Myster's comment about him getting better armor 
&#62; drops while running hell without armor, I started thinking. It seems 
&#62; like the best objects I see usually are around character levels 25-
&#62; 29. It is in that level region where I usually find the suit of plate 
&#62; which I still use into my late 30's, and it is in that level region 
&#62; where I find cool uniques like windforce, etc. I have also noticed 
&#62; that after a rebuild from scratch with no objects, I get great 
&#62; objects rapidly. Code Mysters's comment and my old history seemed to 
&#62; point to a bias in the game towards giving good drops to those who 
&#62; have little.
&#62; 
&#62; So the theory is 'Do you get better drops when you are naked?'. To 
&#62; test this I ran 4 laz runs in normal hell, where I would go down 
&#62; naked and clear level 15. The only mentionable item I got was a 
&#62; royale circlet, which was useless to me as I already had one.
&#62; 
&#62; I did notice something interesting though. When I would come into the 
&#62; game, I would drop everything and remove all equipment, then go visit 
&#62; Grizwald. In game 1, I was offered a kings claymore of the heavens (I 
&#62; bought it). In game 3 I was offered a kings scimitar of sorcery (did 
&#62; not buy it). I also noticed that I got full plate offers from 
&#62; grizwald in 2 of the 4 games.
&#62; 
&#62; Now 4 games is not statistical sample, but I haven't been offered 
&#62; kings weapons since level 23 or so. Now at level 38 I get 2 kings 
&#62; weapons in the space of 2 games at Grizwalds. Is this a trend or 
&#62; coincidence?
&#62; 
&#62; Has anyone else found that Grizwald likes nudists?
