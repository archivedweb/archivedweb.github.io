&#62; first thing, i admit i was rude. but im like that, im very blunt.

I'm blunt too, so you should like this reply.  :)

&#62; yes i do agree they have to start at some point, but not at this 
&#62; point. he knows nothing of the game. what he should do is get to know 
&#62; the game first and then build a clan. if u dont even know a 
&#62; dreamflange is a mace, how the hell r u gonna create a legit clan? 
&#62; this clan will just turn out to be a wash!

Um, big note here, you said absolutely nothing about his Diablo 
knowledge in your original post.  Your point in slamming him was that 
he only had 2 members in his guild.  If the person is a complete 
moron, well, that's different.  However, with what you said in your 
first post, you showed no reason behind your slamming him just for 
his two member guild.

&#62; u 2 dont understand what it takes to create a sucessful clan. it take 
&#62; time and dedication, this kid is still using his fathers email 
&#62; account, now how is he gonna start a clan? it is damn tuff to start a 
&#62; clan my friends. look at inferno, one of the largest clan in bnet. 
&#62; now look what happened to it. destroyed. 

There are clans out there who don't send e-mail between members.  
They just post it all on a web page.  Not the safest way, but when 
you don't have many members, it's possible.

&#62; do u know how it feels when u just joined a clan, and ur all hyped up 
&#62; about it. all of a sudden, u see these cheaters in ur games, u use 
&#62; their items that they give u (and u dont even know they r hacked). 
&#62; damn, waste of money for this game. now even if u still stay in the 
&#62; clan, the clan wont last, cos of the inexperience of the leader. and 
&#62; then as a member, ur left all alone with a character name that has 
&#62; some stupid sufrix on the back. and u have to start a new character. 
&#62; do u know how that feels??? i do. 

A couple things.  I have never joined a guild that requires members 
to have a mark in their name.  I'm not cattle, I don't need to be 
branded.  But, I did join many guilds that had problems with 
cheaters.  They were the thing that lead me to create my guild.  If 
people need to mark their members to keep track of them, they have 
serious problems.  :)

&#62; u need to know a lot of things to be a leader, not just how to make a 
&#62;  nice web page. 

Not necessarily.  I mean, if you have a nice page, and someone who 
could monitor the guild actually joins your clan, then you don't have 
to really do any work.  :)

&#62; now i dont think this kid will do well. and i just dont want him to 
&#62; waste all his time for nothing.

Well, I started out as a 2 person guild.  But now, it's rather large. 
 :)  I don't think I wasted my time, it just took a while to get 
there.  So, anyone who thinks starting as a 2 person guild, can look 
at the 160+ member Clan Legit, one of the larger non-cheating non-pk 
guilds on Battle.net, and realize that lots of things are possible.  
The web page is at:
<a href="http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo/guild.html">http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo/guild.html</a>

&#62; i did not insult him first of all, i 
&#62; just said; &#34;u call that a clan?&#34;, and &#34; why dont u give 
&#62; up&#34;. my third line was gonna be &#34;why dont u join my clan&#34; 
&#62; but he replied a no and then left after the second line. so what can 
&#62; i do?

Um, if I was trying to start a new guild, and you said that to me, 
I'd be pretty insulted.  :)
