<pre>&#62; *Finally* a topic that actually fits the name of the forum!  :)
   Why, thank you.  Credit St. Mike and Dizzy for the idea.

 
&#62; For rogue-rogue games, try crossing your arrow streams.  This works 
&#62; pretty well in hallways - it assures that any monsters trying to 
&#62; reach you have to cross at least one stream.  It's also nifty in 
&#62; doorways to open rooms:
&#62; 
&#62;       s   s   s
&#62;     s   s   s   s  &#60;--- monsters
&#62;       s   s   s 
&#62; ########    ########
&#62;        @    @ &#60;--- rogues
&#62; 
&#62;           @ &#60;--- mage
&#62; 
&#62; (ok, so my nethack/moria background is showing :)  Both rogues fire 
&#62; into the room, crossing streams to set up a kill zone.  The mage is 
&#62; optional :), but he can stand there and fireball monsters that are 
&#62; stunned by the arrows or get through.  He can also stone if you have 
&#62; to beat a hasty retreat.
   Mmmmmm--crossfire is a beee-ootiful thing!!  (and, I always love 
these visuals!!)

  
&#62; 
&#62; That has me wondering just how useful weird/strange bows are in 
&#62; multiplayer.  The warrior's AC is probably much higher than the 
&#62; monsters' AC.  I'm not exactly sure how AC and hit&#37; interrelate, 
&#62; but it's definitely not linear, so you should be able to adjust your 
&#62; hit&#37; to where you only occasionally hit the warrior, but usually 
&#62; hit the monsters.  Maybe a bow with a -hit&#37;?
  This is where the patience comes in.  The warrior takes up 
position, then the rogue and mage take up position to back him up.  
90 degrees from the warrior works well, when possible.

 

&#62; 
&#62; If you're a skilled rogue, you should be helping the mage by stoning
&#62; monsters as well.  :)  
   What are you trying to say???  ;-)  Personally, I can only cast 3
sc's on a full mana globe--is that worth it?  Prob, I guess.


&#62; 
&#62; That's a good tactic - cover for the others.  The mage I usually play 
&#62; with has a hotkey set to say &#34;Wait!  Filling belt!&#34;  Whenever 
&#62; I see this, if we're fighting monsters that fire, I try to position 
&#62; myself 
&#62; 
&#62; A)  perpendicular with him so I can draw their fire away from him,
&#62; or
&#62; B)  in between so I can absorb their fire before it reaches him
&#62; 
&#62; either way he doesn't have to worry about getting hit while shuffling 
&#62; his inventory.
&#62;

  Good hotkey idea.  Hey Dizzy--you aren't talking about anyone 
specific when you say I haven't played with a good fighter yet are 
you?????  *WINKtimWINKNUDGENUDGEtim**  maybe we should try ME as the 
fighter--I've gotten OK (not as good as rogue, but pretty ok . . .).
As soon as Axel recovers some halfway decent junk, maybe we can try
it . . .
