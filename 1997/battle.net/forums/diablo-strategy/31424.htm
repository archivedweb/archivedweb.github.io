<pre>Title: Diablo, Alternate Reality

Author: -=/ Code Myster /=-

Purpose: Make people think about Diablo and it's current state.

Expected Result: hopefully this post will get a few &#34;I agree 
because...&#34; or &#34;I disagree because...&#34; or even a 
&#34;Interesting (NT)&#34; replies.

Distribution: this will be cross posted to both Tavern and Stragety.

Thesis: Had Cheating not existed in Diablo, alot of the same problems 
would still exist.


Ok I have been thinking alot about this lately with all the endless 
complaining about the Cheating that has been going on in Diablo and 
how it has ruined the game. GPOW, KSOH, 255 Apoc staffs, Windforces, 
OZ's are all common place now. The question I asked myself and am 
presenting today is this: &#34;Are we worse off with cheating than if 
it hadn't existed?&#34;.

Let's explore this. Let's assume for a moment that absolutely *NO* 
cheating had taken place in Diablo. No dups, hacks, cheats etc. 
Diablo existed EXACTLY as it was planned by Blizzard.

Now with this base assumption, lets look at the results of what 
Diablo would be like now. As for items, most people would have lots 
of misc jewlery... as OZ's are hard to find, owning one would be a 
little rare with Heavens jewelery being more common place. Most 
higher level people would problibly have some form of Awesome Plate 
Armor as it gets offered at Griz from time to time. It would be rare, 
but some people would also have forms of Godly items etc.

Trading would be a huge part of Diablo. Higher level people would of 
course, be finding better items and trading them off to the lower 
level people while trying to &#34;trade up&#34; in items they use. As 
items wear out (Diablo's Apoc spell lowers Items Dur if anyone doesnt 
know), there would also be a need to replace the items.

In the end, most people would hit a &#34;platue&#34; with respect to 
items stoping at Awsome Plate and Jade/Heavens jewelery.

Here is where I see a difference. In the quest to &#34;better&#34; a 
players char, stealing would become very frequent as people 
frustrated they cannot find greater items on their own, would result 
to stealing. This would cause those with the great items to be very 
selective on thier trading and limit the number of items traded.

As people became scared of trading due to &#34;stealing&#34;, the 
thieves would result to another tactic, one that works against people 
who have no wish to trade.... MKill.

I think Mkilling would become the dominant method to &#34;gain&#34; 
items for alot of people. Someone would enter a game with 300+ HP's 
and everyone else would immediatly begin plotting on how to MK him 
and get his stuff. 

As MKilling became more and more rampant, people frustrated with all 
the stealing and Mkilling going on and would result to joining Guilds 
and playing in private games. Public games would be just too 
dangerous to play in.

Summary: Blizzards Diablo has broken new ground. It has brought up 
new questions that are VERY hard to answer. Game Ethics are now at 
the heart of alot of most game discussions and game designs now.

Games such as UO are going to be constantly monitored to force 
players to play the game as intended allowing less &#34;freedom&#34; 
to the individual players.

As for the current state of Diablo, Cheating has made everyone 
&#34;equal&#34;. There is no need to kill others unless you are 
either PK or PK hunter. 

Now, people stay out of public games for 2 reasons. #1 is that they 
wish to avoid PK's. #2 is that they wish to avoid &#34;cheaters&#34;. 
Had Diablo existed &#34;cheat free&#34;, everyone would still be 
avoiding public games because of a more serious threat, the threat of 
getting MK'ed and losing everything they own.

Which Diablo would be better? I do not know... if I had to answer, I 
would take Diablo in it's current state than this senario I have 
presented. I have played with alot of cheaters, most have been very 
fun to play with. I have also played with PK's.... not a single one 
of them has been at all &#34;fun&#34;. 

You will have to answer this question for yourself.
