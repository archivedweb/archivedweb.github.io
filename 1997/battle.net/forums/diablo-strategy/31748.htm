<pre>I bought a masters sword of haste from griz for 63k, its nice and 
fast but i still miss alot as a mage.  I had a sword of the vampire 
for awhile but i found that because my hit number was to low i wasnt 
regenerating my mana for my mana shield fast enough for it to be 
worth using.

&#62; Skyye,

&#62;      I have tried King's Flail of haste and King's Sword of Vampire, 
&#62; which I bought and found.  I thought the Haste would really help out 
&#62; the mage, but it really didn't.  It speeded up just a little bit. The 
&#62; King's Sword of Vampire is cool on mages, but since you get less than 
&#62; 5 mana/hit(since damage is less than 100, it comes down around 3 to 4 
&#62; mana per hit) it doesn't do much for a mages who have total mana of 
&#62; around 850 or above. (It still helps :) I prefer useing staff. 
&#62; (king's war staff of Haste would be great for those nasty triple 
&#62; immunes.)  I personally use AA Ressurect. I love the staff. If anyone 
&#62; of the party member dies, they can be ressurected using the staff and 
&#62; +2 to magic lvl doesn't hurt. :)  I have AAA (12 charges, best I 
&#62; bought so far other than bountiful staff of apoc (30 charges but got 
&#62; stolen :( )  and AA firball.
&#62; 
&#62; Lestat, lost and confused.
&#62; 
&#62; P.S. Mages are meant to use Staff.  Those dirty sword and shield 
&#62; aren't for mages. 8p

&#62; &#62; I won't bother talking about Dreamflange or staffs or spells; others

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Someone else also mentioned the King's Sword of Haste--this is an 
&#62; &#62; excellent sword for the mage, as it counter-balances the mage's 
&#62; &#62; weakness as a melee fighter and mage's relatively slow swing-speed.  
&#62; &#62; I've used this sword with my mage (bought the broadsword version from 
&#62; &#62; Griz for about 80k) and it worked very well.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Another excellent sword for the mage would be a King's (or Master's) 
&#62; &#62; Sword of Vampire, so you could constantly replenish your mana shield 
&#62; &#62; and spell-casting ability every time you hit an attacker.  This would 
&#62; &#62; be really, really cool.  I personally have never found or bought one, 
&#62; &#62; but I am always on the lookout for one.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; As for boosting your magic levels with the sword, forget it--that's 
&#62; &#62; what rings and amulets are for.  I had a Master's Sword of Sorcery 
&#62; &#62; but I found I was much better off with a different suffix (like 
&#62; &#62; Haste) that would counter the inherent weaknesses of the mage--and 
&#62; &#62; not merely add to areas that the mage is already strong in.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; hope this helps...</pre>
