<pre>&#62; I have also noticed that my CL spell costs me about 28 mana to cast.  
&#62; In comparison, Fireball costs 10 and does 10 times the damage(ok, not 
&#62; quite, but follow my point here).  What level CL do you have to have 
&#62; to lower that spell costs??  Every book I get lowers the cost by an 
&#62; excruciatingly small 1 mana.  Damage increase is minimal.  Is there 
&#62; some point where it starts making a bigger difference to get CL 
&#62; books??  At this rate, the least it will cost is about 20.  When I 
&#62; get in scraps with SoulBurners, and the like, I have to really pump 
&#62; out the lightnin to kill em.  That bleeds the mana like a bucket with 
&#62; a hole in it.  I end up spending more on mana pots than I am picking 
&#62; off the ground (ok..another exaggeration..but you get the idea) 

As with lightning, each reading of a Chain Lightning book increases 
the length of the bolt.  That being the case, each time something is 
hit, it gets hit often (usually)  Also, a less known fact about Chain 
Lightning, is that the higher the level, the farther away a monster 
can be, and still be targeted by the chain lightning.  Eventually 
(like, oh, after you reach level 45 or so) you'll learn some tactics 
to use when casting Chain so that you won't have the huge gaps in it. 
 :)

&#62; Another thing, how do you higher end mages deal with triple immunes.  
&#62; I have read of people using melee weapons, but it seems unreasonable. 
&#62;  My mage swings a sword like a decrepit grandmother.  How am I to 
&#62; deal with these immune bastards?  My AC isn't the best on the planet, 
&#62; but mages aren't supposed to have great AC (I think mine is around 
&#62; 130).  My &#37; to hit is sickening (94&#37;) when attacking tougher 
&#62; creatures.  Djinn just swings and swings, as if fanning the demons to 
&#62; appease them.  

Well, currently, I'm looking for a King's Great Sword of Haste, so 
that I can do a lot of damage in a little time.  (relatively)  So, 
until then, I'm still with the golem.  :)  

Little known use for golems.  Enemy finders.  Send one out into an 
open room, and all the witches will start firing at him from 
everywhere, but he won't be close enough to trigger them to move.  A 
nice (and little known) way to figure out roughly what you're up 
against (so you can decide to run or not)  hehehehe.

Another seldom known fact is that Nightmare Hell still gives 
experience to level 46 mages.  So, why bother with hell/hell when you 
can just go to nightmare/hell and get more experience per hour there.
