<pre>If you're not TOO tired of this discussion, let's continue . . .

I read your last post (which is now somewhere near the bottom of this 
page), and, like you, have been giving this some thought.  As I 
understand it, you consider backing up the data files using a third 
party program or DOS (even following Blizzard's instructions) to be 
&#34;cheating.&#34;  Based on an earlier post, however, you do not 
consider backing up your entire hard drive, character data included, 
to be cheating.  I see these views as inconsistent and want to 
explore any differences you see.

I want to start out by making two things clear.  First, we are not 
talking about a multiplayer &#34;save&#34; function like the one that 
exists in single player mode.  Diablo already does this automatically 
for you in multiplayer.  And I agree, and I think most everyone else 
does as well, that restoring a backed-up character file to avoid 
adverse consequences that occurred during game play (e.g., loss of 
items to monsters) is cheating (even though it can be done in single 
player mode).

Second, there is a difference between &#34;backing up&#34; the 
character data files by copying them to a new location or disk, and 
&#34;restoring&#34; that character data file by copying it back  
(Aahz and I, in fact, have just exchanged emails on this issue).  The 
mere act of backing up, as long as the act of restoration does not 
occur, cannot in my opinion be called cheating.  It by itself has no 
effect on your character or your game.  It may make you play more 
carelessly because you know you can always regain your equipment, but 
that use clearly is cheating and my assumption will be that the 
backup was not done for that purpose.  (Of course, the temptation to 
cheat by using it in this manner may be there, but I will assume that 
the user has the moral fortitude to resist that temptation, just as 
he or she already has resisted the temptation to dupe, etc.)  (In 
case you're wondering, I do back up my character data files, but I 
have not yet had cause to restore them.)

Thus, I see no difference between copying the specific data files by 
DOS or by Kevin's program and copying these files as part of a larger 
group (up to and including the entire hard disk).  In each case, the 
data is being transferred by a third-party program to another, 
presumably safer, location.

To use another analogy, when playing other CRPGs I often copied the 
save game files to a floppy disk in case something happened to 
corrupt those save game files or if my hard drive crashed.  If I 
tried to retrieve one of those saved games within the game and 
discovered the saved game was corrupted, was it cheating for me to 
copy my back-up file back into the saved game directory?  I don't 
think so.

If the restoration of the Diablo back-up files is done for similar 
reasons, then I see no difference.  What really matters is how and 
why the restoration is done.

Let me enlarge on my AD&D character data sheet analogy a little bit 
with respect to the metagame concept of roleplaying a character.  
When I am roleplaying my character during a game, whatever happens to 
my character happens and can only be reversed or corrected from 
&#34;within&#34; the game (my character has &#34;continuity&#34; or 
&#34;history&#34;).  If my sword breaks or gets lost, I have to 
repair it or find a new one.  In my AD&D game, the sword gets marked 
off my character data sheet.  If that data sheet was lost, it would 
be cheating if I recreated it and gave myself that sword back (or if 
I used an older copy that still had the sword on it).  It is not 
cheating if my new sheet is exactly the same as the one that was lost 
 (in fact, using backup files on a computer avoids human memory 
lapses, and thus is less likely to result in variations in the 
character data restored).

The key in each game is to focus not on the data file or sheet, but 
on the continuity of the character.  The character, and his or her 
history, should NOT be affected by events or actions outside the 
game, whether it be hacking the data file to increase stats, or 
corruption or loss of the data file itself.

Let me pose an interesting hypothetical for Diablo:  you back up your 
character one day, play the next day and lose all your equipment.  
Not wanting to be a cheater, on the third day (after recovering from 
your depression!) you go treasure hunting to replace your equipment.  
For some reason (your character data file is corrupted, the machine's 
&#34;name&#34; changes, etc.), you can't start a Diablo game with 
your character!  You back up the character data file, which works, 
but upon starting you find that you still have all of the equipment 
you lost because the backup occurred one day before the game where 
you lost it all.  Is it cheating to keep the equipment?  I think so, 
based on my analysis above.  What should you do?  Toss all the 
equipment that you lost (goodbye ObZod Ring, goodbye Awesome Plate . 
. :(  ).  Why? To restore character continuity as closely as possible.

BTW, I recently saw a post on this issue in which someone said they 
viewed the hard disk crash, file corruption, etc. as part of the 
history of their character.  I think this breaches the boundary 
between the RPG and RL, and is not proper roleplaying (but, then, I 
am a roleplaying purist at heart).  (Despite the fact that I sign 
these posts with my character's name, these posts are not part of my 
character's &#34;history.&#34;)

Once again this is longer than intended.  Sorry . . .
