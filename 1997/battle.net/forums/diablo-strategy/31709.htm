&#62; i believe blizzard calls this game an action RPG, am i right?
&#62; so if it is an RPG the a have a few questions for u people. a mage 
&#62; would do anything to boost his powers in the magic area if magic 
&#62; existed rght? so, why does everybody want a zod ring????? a real mage 
&#62; would rather have a wyrm's ring of wizadry than a obsidian zod ring, 
&#62; corect? same with warriors, if u want to use the best magic, BE A 
&#62; MAGE!!!! stop trying to boost all your magic up to use lvl 15 
&#62; fireball! instead focus on beating the crap out of stuff! (thats what 
&#62; u are good at :). but rouges are different. sure u should boost ur 
&#62; dex up, but blizzard made them to be able to fight and use mid lvl 
&#62; spells. thats why they are the best class :) yes mages can fry 
&#62; everything naked, so why worry about a zod ring when u can use a wiz 
&#62; ring?
&#62; when u are naked u don't need strength, so to all u mages who say we 
&#62; don't need armor, DON'T USE IT THEN!!! just wear magic and mana 
&#62; boosting equipment to kick @$$!!!! i have a mage, and i love him for 
&#62; his magic prowess, but i like my rouge better for her way to easily 
&#62; handle any situiation.sure, u mages will say get her cornered and 
&#62; she's dead, but remember we can teleport to :) we also have life and 
&#62; magic to go through, and with windforce we can keep the baddies back.
&#62; but wait, we can stone things too!!!! :)
&#62; well, i know a bunch of mages, and like i said i love mine, so Aahz, 
&#62; i don't do this out of mage hate :). people will be mad at me 
&#62; starting this debate, but i am not debating, i am mearly telling 
&#62; people what an rpg is supposed to be like, e-mail me if u like, i get 
&#62; bored saoetoimes and would love to read your posts.
&#62; 
&#62; -alvais lvl 33 rogue LEGIT!
&#62; -alvain lvl 14 mage LEGIT!
&#62; 

ok its time to reveal my secret, woooooo. well i have a level 38 
rogue, a level 15 warrior, and a level 40, yes 40 mage. i got the 
mage so high for 2 reason, one accident, i kept on using him to help 
newbies and hunting in nite hell that i forgot about the levels. 
mages do frow fast. and the second reason is i want a fair argument 
if this debate does come up again.

well guess what, it here. well, i think the mage is very powerful, 
fun to play with. but slightly too powerful sometimes. if u r playing 
a co op game, ur partners better watch out for that level 20 fireball 
coming. they r good for co op games if u play it safe. as Aahz plays, 
he uses stone. now this is the best type of mages. they do not try to 
out do what they should do (huh? does that make sense?) . 

mages r fun but i like my rogue better. cos it requires a lot more 
strategy. using of walls and doorways is a must. and i like the fact 
that i dont have to worry about immune to all witches in hell hell. 
with the help of an experience mage, a rogue can clear hell hell 
easily.

i just started a warrior, but i shouldnt give my opinion on them yet, 
cos i m only 15. but it is definitly the hardest class to play for 
me. without range attack, its damn hard to play. what m i suppose to 
do when i see 20 arrows shooting goats? actually bloodstart shooting 
goats. although this hasnt occured yet, but what happens if i see 
those witches? i need some suggestion.

in my conclusion, i think there is no best class (yes brett i know u 
ll be happy to hear this). but there is a class that u can like or 
use the best. and for me, thats the rogue. this is a preference 
thing. u like to eat harveys, i like to eat mac donalds. simple as 
that. and alvais likes mac donalds as well. =)

DarkSniper

&#62; PS, i just got fined $105.00 in court so mabye i am just pissed off 
&#62; and need to vent :) if u are a mage and i know u don't be mad, just 
&#62; give me a good slap in the face :)

p.s. i ll think twice before i use fireworks next time al... well at 
least u didnt go to jail =) egg ur neighbours! maybe u ll get another 
fine. </pre>
