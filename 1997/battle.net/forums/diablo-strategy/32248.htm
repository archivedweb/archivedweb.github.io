<pre>After reading Code Myster's comment about him getting better armor 
drops while running hell without armor, I started thinking. It seems 
like the best objects I see usually are around character levels 25-
29. It is in that level region where I usually find the suit of plate 
which I still use into my late 30's, and it is in that level region 
where I find cool uniques like windforce, etc. I have also noticed 
that after a rebuild from scratch with no objects, I get great 
objects rapidly. Code Mysters's comment and my old history seemed to 
point to a bias in the game towards giving good drops to those who 
have little.

So the theory is 'Do you get better drops when you are naked?'. To 
test this I ran 4 laz runs in normal hell, where I would go down 
naked and clear level 15. The only mentionable item I got was a 
royale circlet, which was useless to me as I already had one.

I did notice something interesting though. When I would come into the 
game, I would drop everything and remove all equipment, then go visit 
Grizwald. In game 1, I was offered a kings claymore of the heavens (I 
bought it). In game 3 I was offered a kings scimitar of sorcery (did 
not buy it). I also noticed that I got full plate offers from 
grizwald in 2 of the 4 games.

Now 4 games is not statistical sample, but I haven't been offered 
kings weapons since level 23 or so. Now at level 38 I get 2 kings 
weapons in the space of 2 games at Grizwalds. Is this a trend or 
coincidence?

Has anyone else found that Grizwald likes nudists?
