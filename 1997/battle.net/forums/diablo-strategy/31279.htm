&#62; &#62; &#62; first thing, i admit i was rude. but im like that, im very blunt.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I'm blunt too, so you should like this reply.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; yeah blunt is good, but u also have to read what i posted
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; yes i do agree they have to start at some point, but not at this 
&#62; &#62; &#62; point. he knows nothing of the game. what he should do is get to know 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the game first and then build a clan. if u dont even know a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; dreamflange is a mace, how the hell r u gonna create a legit clan? 
&#62; &#62; &#62; this clan will just turn out to be a wash!
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Um, big note here, you said absolutely nothing about his Diablo 
&#62; &#62; knowledge in your original post.
&#62; 
&#62; i did say he knows nothing of the game. just didnt elaborate on it 
&#62; cos i didnt think it was necessary.

Well if that was your main point you should have elaborated on it.

&#62; 
&#62;   Your point in slamming him was that 
&#62; &#62; he only had 2 members in his guild.  If the person is a complete 
&#62; &#62; moron, well, that's different.  However, with what you said in your 
&#62; &#62; first post, you showed no reason behind your slamming him just for 
&#62; &#62; his two member guild.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; u 2 dont understand what it takes to create a sucessful clan. it take 
&#62; &#62; &#62; time and dedication, this kid is still using his fathers email 
&#62; &#62; &#62; account, now how is he gonna start a clan? it is damn tuff to start a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; clan my friends. look at inferno, one of the largest clan in bnet. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; now look what happened to it. destroyed. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There are clans out there who don't send e-mail between members.  
&#62; &#62; They just post it all on a web page.  Not the safest way, but when 
&#62; &#62; you don't have many members, it's possible.
&#62; 
&#62; that would be a complete mess if some cheaters wanna destroy ur clan. 
&#62; a pure useless idea. and when i said he does have an email, i meant 
&#62; he is too young and inexperence. if u dont have ur own email, how the 
&#62; hell r ur members gonna find u when they have a question? post in the 
&#62; web page? u know how inconvinent it is?
&#62;

Well it seems to work well for Clan Legit. We post, others respond,
we need help in a clan game, we post a message and anyone who reads 
it comes and helps, or we use ICQ. 
 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; do u know how it feels when u just joined a clan, and ur all hyped up 
&#62; &#62; &#62; about it. all of a sudden, u see these cheaters in ur games, u use 
&#62; &#62; &#62; their items that they give u (and u dont even know they r hacked). 
&#62; &#62; &#62; damn, waste of money for this game. now even if u still stay in the 
&#62; &#62; &#62; clan, the clan wont last, cos of the inexperience of the leader. and 
&#62; &#62; &#62; then as a member, ur left all alone with a character name that has 
&#62; &#62; &#62; some stupid sufrix on the back. and u have to start a new character. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; do u know how that feels??? i do. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; A couple things.  I have never joined a guild that requires members 
&#62; &#62; to have a mark in their name.  I'm not cattle, I don't need to be 
&#62; &#62; branded.  But, I did join many guilds that had problems with 
&#62; &#62; cheaters.  They were the thing that lead me to create my guild.  If 
&#62; &#62; people need to mark their members to keep track of them, they have 
&#62; &#62; serious problems.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; i agree with u, but seemingly, over half of the clan dont. look at 
&#62; the big 2, inferno and snakegod. and a lot of other clans. and that 
&#62; is what happened to me when i joined my first clan. just using it as 
&#62; an example to show how bad it feels when a clan is down.
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; u need to know a lot of things to be a leader, not just how to make a 
&#62; &#62; &#62;  nice web page. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Not necessarily.  I mean, if you have a nice page, and someone who 
&#62; &#62; could monitor the guild actually joins your clan, then you don't have 
&#62; &#62; to really do any work.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; then u wouldnt be a true leader would u? i mean, yeah u can tell this 
&#62; guy to do something and that guy to do others. but in conclusion, if 
&#62; u dont really do any work, then ur not a true leader. ur just a 
&#62; person with the highest rank who do jac.
&#62; 

FMF doesn't have to tell anyone to do things for the Clan, I among 
others ahve volunteered to help simply because it's a great Clan.
Have you even looked at FMF web pages? If you do you can see he does 
do alot of work both on the Clan and on his Diablo Information pages.
If you have to ORDER your clan memebers to do the work then you don't 
really ahve their support just their fear of being kicked out.


&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; now i dont think this kid will do well. and i just dont want him to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; waste all his time for nothing.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Well, I started out as a 2 person guild.  But now, it's rather large. 
&#62; &#62;  :)  I don't think I wasted my time, it just took a while to get 
&#62; &#62; there.
&#62; 
&#62; did i ever said anything about starting with 2 person? i started with 
&#62; 3, not much of a difference. its his ability and his knowlege
&#62; 
&#62;   So, anyone who thinks starting as a 2 person guild, can look 
&#62; &#62; at the 160+ member Clan Legit, one of the larger non-cheating non-pk 
&#62; &#62; guilds on Battle.net, and realize that lots of things are possible. 
&#62; 
&#62; as i said before if u read my post. the numbers of members means 
&#62; nothing. i can say i have 130. i saw that clan from melissa that has 
&#62; 600. and some clan has over a 1000. so? dont tell me u see 160+ 
&#62; members everyday in ur channel. and dont tell me u have 40 games open 
&#62; per nite. i dont think so eh? if it is true, put me down as one of ur 
&#62; members!
&#62;  

Nah, but we can pretty much find open clan games anytime of the day 
or night. 

&#62; &#62; The web page is at:
&#62; &#62; <a href="http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo/guild.html">http://www.gac.edu/~gkemmetm/diablo/guild.html</a>
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; i did not insult him first of all, i 
&#62; &#62; &#62; just said; &#34;u call that a clan?&#34;, and &#34; why dont u give 
&#62; &#62; &#62; up&#34;. my third line was gonna be &#34;why dont u join my clan&#34; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; but he replied a no and then left after the second line. so what can 
&#62; &#62; &#62; i do?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Um, if I was trying to start a new guild, and you said that to me, 
&#62; &#62; I'd be pretty insulted.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; well, too bad cos i d say the same thing to u if it happened ;)
