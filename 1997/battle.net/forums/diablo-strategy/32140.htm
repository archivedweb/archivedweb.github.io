&#62; &#62;  You *HAVE* to be wearing the darkness 
&#62; &#62; &#62; rings when you ENTER the level! 
&#62; 
&#62; I also noticed that when wearing the items of darkness that my portal 
&#62; and guardians DID NOT REVEAL THE MONSTERS THAT WERE ONLY A COUPLE OF 
&#62; SQUARES FROM ME!!  That is to say, in an apparently well lit area (an 
&#62; area lit by several guardians), the monsters were INVISIBLE TO ME!!!  
&#62; This really sucked, as it seemed that they could see me at a 
&#62; distance, but I could not see them until they were right on top of 
&#62; me!! 
&#62; 
&#62; You might want to experiment with the effects of 'artificial light'.  
&#62; Such as guardian, Town Portal, lightning, fireball, etc.  These 
&#62; effects didn't seem to make sense at the time.
&#62; 
&#62; Also, if you were to die on a level which you initally 'seeded' as 
&#62; 'dark', and therefore had to re-enter the level from town without 
&#62; wearing darkness items, would the level 're-seed' itself to let the 
&#62; monsters see you?
&#62; 
&#62; just some things to try,
&#62; 
&#62; Artemis II

I think the monstervision &#60;g&#62; gets reset every time a 
character
enters the level, based on _that_ character's light radius.
This would explain several instances we have had where
the first person down the stairs could wander around close
to the stairs without triggering any monsters, but as soon
as the second showed up, the monsters started streaming
in from all sides.

Cudos to CM for figuring this out.  I had noticed the fact that
increased light radius caused monsters to trigger from 
farther away, but it never even occurred to me to test
the reverse!  But I've suspected for a while that my Royal 
Circlet was actually handicapping me a little, in addition 
to all its advantages.

A related phenomenon I have observed is that a golem is
visible to all monsters in line of sight (I'm not sure about 
those out of LOS).  I've tried popping off a golem in hell
a few times, and had bloodstars streaming in at it from
all over the place.  Some time after it died, they stopped.

One time, the stars kept coming at the place the golem
used to be for such a long time that I got curious.  They
were coming down a corridor I had not been down yet.
After they stopped, I moved over to the wall and sent
streams of arrows down the corridor till no more witches
screamed.  Then I moved out from the wall 1 square, and
repeated until I had cleared the corridor.  The witches
never fired a shot at me.  I proceeded down to see where
they were.  Turns out the corridor ran the entire length 
of the level (across the bottom right side).  The witches
were all clumped (in lumps now ;-) at the extreme far 
corner from where I started with the golem.  They were
able to see the golem from the opposite side of the 
dungeon!


btw, monstervision gets reset when a char enters the 
level.  herovision &#60;g&#62;  gets reset each time _any_ hero
changes his/her light radius (I think).  Does that mean
you could go down &#34;cloaked&#34; then switch to 
_increased_ light radius and wander around a fully
lit dungeon invisible to the monsters?  _That_ would
be cool!
