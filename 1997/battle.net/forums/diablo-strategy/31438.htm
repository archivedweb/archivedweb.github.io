<blockquote>
<pre>I think you're still legit because you got screwed by some Blizzard 
programer's STUPID menu design, not because you couldn't legitimately 
get your stuff back.  I don't know what idiot put &#34;Start a New 
Game&#34; above (and logically, before) &#34;Restart in Town&#34;, 
but I'd like to Stone Curse him and use his head for archery 
practice.  OK, maybe that's a bit extreme...then again, maybe not.  :)

Also, who designed that screen that says &#34;Create a New Game&#34;? 
 What else are you gonna do at that point?  Why not just go straight 
to the next menu screen where you choose the difficulty level?  The 
two separate screens should be combined into one.

Anyway, I'm sure you get my main point--you didn't lose your stuff 
because of anything within the game itself, only something external 
to the game.  However, this is a good example of why when you lose 
your stuff, you should be very, very careful, and not do goofy things 
like trying to turn on the music.

IMHO, you're still legit, though others may disagree.

And restarting can be a fun challenge, but I understand if you're not 
into playing another 60 Laz runs just to find that Dreamflange 
again...</pre>
