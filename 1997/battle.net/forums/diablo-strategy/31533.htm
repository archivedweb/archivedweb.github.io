&#62; Ya know, one of the reasons I liked the character Aahz so much is 
&#62; that he can put into words his feelings... I try to do just that but 
&#62; often fail and end up starting a war or two :)
&#62; 
&#62; You my friend, have easily summed up my feelings 100&#37; in your 
&#62; post. I hope others will read this and possibly understand what I 
&#62; meant in past posts.
&#62; 
&#62; I am not a char as &#34;white as the driven snow&#34;, I don't think 
&#62; I ever truely claimed to be. I have cheated a little, I will continue 
&#62; to cheat a little. I have played more games of Diablo than alot of 
&#62; people who post here combined. On your scale of 0-10 with 10 being 
&#62; &#34;legit&#34; I would rank myself at 7.5. 
&#62; 
&#62; I really don't know how to close this message.... I'm still getting 
&#62; over the shock of the original post. If I could only have 1 wish in 
&#62; Diablo right now, it would be that all the self proclaimed 
&#62; &#34;legits&#34; really read and study the above post. 
&#62; 
&#62; Again, thank you for your post, if nothing else, it means alot to me.

Code Myster,

I do not know you well, but I have read many of you posts, and can 
tell that you are sometimes misunderstood.  I often feel the same, 
and the length and depth of my post was, in part, my attempt to try 
to clear up some previous discussions where I feel I failed to 
represent myself well.

In my opinion, it is good that you admit that you have cheated, and I 
think you should realize that there is nothing inherently wrong with 
it.  As long as you are enjoying the game and not hurting others, go 
with it.

You are quite welcome for the post, and I'm very pleased that it 
meant something to someone.  Even if no one else reads or responds to 
my post, I am happy knowing that it was not for nothing.
