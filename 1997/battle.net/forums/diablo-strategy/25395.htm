<pre>The point is ALL games die, some sooner than others.  I'd say Diablo 
has managed to hold the interest of it's players
much longer than the average game, I know it did mine.

So Diablo doesn't thrill you like it did the day you opened the box, 
name a game that does.  The Realms and even
Ultima Online will face the same fate, games are a transitory thing.  
As the old players leave new ones take over
thats just the way it is.

Actually it's a good thing games do get boring after awhile.  There 
wouldn't be much point to making new ones if
they didn't, no one would have time to play the new ones cause they'd 
still be too busy playing the old one.  In fact
you'd only need 1 game. :)

Eventually I'm sure there will be a new Diablo or one based on it, 
have a little patience.  Kinda stupid to release
a sequel (or even hint at one) while the original is still selling 
well.

&#62; &#62; Where do you get this crap from?  You don't have any sense my dear 
&#62; &#62; friend?  Name anything in life that doesn't slowly die??  Got any?  
&#62; &#62; Doubt it!!  Oh, a rock!!
&#62; 
&#62; Not so..I can think of many things that I have done all my life that 
&#62; still are quite interesting to me....like sports, hobbies, etc.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Are you just making this up as you go?  I have yet to have the same 
&#62; &#62; items since day one, I keep getting better items or I started a new 
&#62; &#62; character.  Have you tried multi player?  And had a challenging game?
&#62; 
&#62; Technically, the games are not the same. However, how much different 
&#62; is a game with a few walls rearranged and a few diff items presented? 
&#62;  
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Yeah, the 12 year olds!! 
&#62; &#62;
&#62; Wrong!!!! I have played since the game was released back in January i 
&#62; think....Most people cheat to some degree. Cheating has gotten so bad 
&#62; that only g-mode players are considered cheaters these days. 
&#62; Technically, if you even have a duped item you are a cheater. I bet 
&#62; 90&#37; of the players on bnet have duped items whether they know it 
&#62; or not. 
&#62; 
&#62; Most of my friends on bnet cheat and try to lie about it. I don't 
&#62; really mind b/c they are cool guys.....and yes, most of them are over 
&#62; 20 yrs old.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; &#62; Last time I looked Starcraft is right around the corner!  And then 
&#62; &#62; the new Warcraft game.  I would have to believe no company puts out a 
&#62; &#62; sequel within a year of realeasing the original.  Give them a good 
&#62; &#62; year or year and a half, to release a new Diablo.  Look at Warcraft, 
&#62; &#62; Warcraft 2 came out over a year later.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Patience is a virtue my friend.  Realize a great game and applaud it!!
&#62; 
&#62; Diablo was a great game...but it is too limited. After coops for a 
&#62; month I tired of them. After dueling for 4 months I tired of them too 
&#62; :(  
&#62; 
&#62; Too bad b/c I once really liked to duel, but now I realize that no 
&#62; matter how good you are, the action of the game prevents you from 
&#62; getting significantly better. Those of you that played Street fighter 
&#62; II in the old days when the game was still a game of skill will 
&#62; understand what I am talking about. That game you could play forever 
&#62; and progressively improve at it almost like a sport. Diablo is really 
&#62; a contest of half decent reflexes combined with whoever can get their 
&#62; hands on the best stuff.
&#62; 
&#62; Don't believe me? Think I am full of crap? Well, look around the 
&#62; forums and tell me a veteran's name that still posts in this forum or 
&#62; in odgen's tavern. You know what? The only veterans left only post 
&#62; and play Diablo just so they can &#34;hang&#34; with their friends. 
&#62; When I look at the names in these forums, I see all newbie posts. 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Don't get me wrong, I think Diablo is a really great game. I still 
&#62; play it once a week maybe. I once played every day for hours and 
&#62; hours! Now....I have returned to WC2. So until Diablo 2, I'll be 
&#62; training ogres and smashing stuff :)</pre>
