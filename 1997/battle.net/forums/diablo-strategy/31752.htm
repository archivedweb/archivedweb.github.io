<pre>&#62; To DarkSniper:
&#62; 
&#62;     You are the most paraniod person I have seen in a long time! Do I 
&#62; scare you that much? Why do you see me as your nemesis? No matter 
&#62; what I post whether for good or bad, you are RIGHT there in my face. 

i will be in anyones face if i dont agree with that person. i dont 
give a $hit who u r. i got in an argument with brett, fire mad flesh, 
lorax, mana flux... just to name a few. it not only u.

&#62; I have been really trying hard to avoid flaming you hard over this 
&#62; because you are really starting to annoy me. I can't believe your 
&#62; second post in the replies trying to twist this into some other 
&#62; argument about legitimacy. My thanks to Red Herring for his post at 
&#62; least giving me the benefit of this summary before saying anything.

i did say i m waiting for ur summary, and did u read my title? it 
said estimation! which means its not the truth, is what i m guessing 
ur trying to say.
 
&#62; 
&#62;     You do *NOT* own this channel. I will not back down either (the 
&#62; raw amount email to me today from others shows me that even though we 
&#62; are not in agreement, there are alot of people who enjoy seeing me 
&#62; around here).

first off, i NEVER said i own this channel. this is the strategy 
forum, not the darksniper forum. just because i disagree with u does 
it mean that i own this forum? i dont think so. do i care how many 
emails u get? this is not a popularity contest. i dont care if 
everyone here likes me or not. if i want them to like me, i wouldnt 
offend so many people in this forum.
hey if u r jealous about post from people who enjoys my post, thats 
too bad. sometimes life sux.and i do nothing to make them like my 
post. i m just express what i feel. if they like it thats good, if 
they dont, thats fine with me also.

&#62; 
&#62;      Get over yourself DarkSniper, becomming the &#34;eugene&#34; of 
&#62; Stragety is not your best move.

did i ever said its a good move? btw why? cos we both disagree on 
stuff u say? hey if u cant be critizied, then dont post here. if u 
post something, u r bound to get people who agrees or disagrees with 
u. it just happens that the stuff u put up r stuff that  i dont 
agree. 

so i guess if someone disagree with u, then hes annoying huh? well 
too bad then let me be annoying. if u dont wanna be annoyed then dont 
even bother posting here. but pls dont get me wrong, i m not 
suggesting u to leave but i just want u to know that, i have the 
rights to agree or disagree with u. in the posting guide lines, there 
r nothing about &#34; u cant disagree with someone&#34;. if u think i 
was flaming u then take it the way u want to.


DarkSniper

p.s. i dont think this means anything to u, but i totally lost any 
respect i had for u. and i m sure u ll probably say the same.</pre>
