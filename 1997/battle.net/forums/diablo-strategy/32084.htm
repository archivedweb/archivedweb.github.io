<pre>I see the advantage of using a hallway with both sides of the hall 
cleared, IE an east west hall with all mobs dead north and south of 
the hallway. The trouble I have with it is that if I am clearing the 
level fast, I would rather port in and burn a blue from the corner 
and move on, than to retreat and set up a great kill. I guess you 
could say port into every northern room and out again and get the 
whole northern half of the level chasing you into the hallway for a 
nice chain (if you had a really great ac). Has anyone ever tried 
stirring up the entire level and waiting at a spot for chain? On 
normal difficulty laz runs I notice the game really slows down as it 
tries to process the simultaneous movement of many many mobs. The 
'leading the stragglers into a corner' trick basically is ignoring 
them and having them follow me into the next room to be cleared. For 
areas like the cats where you have hallways surrounding rooms, it 
seems best to port into the corner of the room first, then do the 
hallway, else your bolts ground on the wall of the room.

With regards to guardian, I am of a split mind in the matter. If I 
use fireball, it only takes one stray fireball to take out my rogue 
buddy. I have a pentium 100 and he has a mmx 166, so there are many 
times when the update rates get out of synch and we appear to 
spontaneously appear out of nowhere to each other. Many times I have 
stone cursed something and watched my rogue friend fire off in a 
direction with no mobs, then see the stone cursed creature die in the 
location where the rogue was firing. The rogue moves by quantum 
leaps, and I don't feel good about using fireball in these situations.

Firebolt is far to wimpy to make headway. Guardian does light up the 
room and flush out the creatures. A level 18 guardian does about 50-
150 damage per firebolt, and a level 18 firebolt does something like 
35hp, so guardian is useful. Its a wash- the rogues arrow or my 
guardian may get the killing xp blow in, so the xp split is fair. It 
seems best if I cast guardian into a room, and have the Rogue 
position herself to pick them off as they come through the doorway. 
Another good place is to put a guardian around a corner, and have the 
Rogue position for things turning the corner. That way we both get 
xp, and there are no stray shots. Where things get difficult is if 
the Rogue runs off down the hall, and there is nothing I can do but 
assist by stone curse or heal other, both of which net 0xp. 

For the most part guardian is a spell my rogue buddy loves, but its 
the hidden that cause most of the problems. When you have low ac and 
say teleport, guardian, lightning bolt and stone curse hot keyed and 
you go down a new level with illusion weavers or hidden, unless you 
set up guardians fast you die on or near the stairs. For some reason 
the illusion weavers/hidden are not under the same 
movement/activation restrictions as other mobs- they will come a long 
ways away out of direct line of sight of you to kill you. 

g    m1 R m2     S

Hidden are wimps too- so say your rogue, R, is in the lead and you, 
S, cast guardian, g,  beyond the rogue and the mob at m1, the 
guardian fires back towards you. However if the hidden flees, it 
might flee away from the rogue and guardian, so when it returns to m2 
the rogue is in the line of fire. Of course none of this is a problem 
for an armored mage, you just sit there until surrounded by illusion 
weavers, then fireball them one ball at a time (they are not hitting 
you). I am presently trying to come up with a decent multiplayer 
tactic for dealing with the hidden.</pre>
