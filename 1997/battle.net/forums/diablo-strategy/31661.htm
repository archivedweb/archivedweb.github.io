&#62; Boots,
&#62;     Just wanted to revise my rather hasty assessment of the situation 
&#62; you described before with the zodiacs.  While I have never lost a 
&#62; host of equiptment using my pride destroying method of recovery, I 
&#62; can see how it is possible.  In many situations, I was playing on a 
&#62; LAN and called a friend to join the game and help.  Obviously, this 
&#62; is a little tricky to do in other situations :)  In general, once you 
&#62; lose your items, you shouldn't try to beat them with &#34;backup&#34; 
&#62; equiptment.  I don't believe in backup equiptment.  It's weaker than 
&#62; your primary, so what makes you think you can beat these baddies when 
&#62; you couldn't do it fully loaded?  Following that logic, it's better 
&#62; to try and get in naked and lure em around the level.  Of course, 
&#62; when the monsters choose to rest their greasy asses on the bottom 
&#62; stair, it's a little tricky to manage a recovery as I suggested.
&#62; 
&#62; One note:  I never suggested a phase or teleport.  In that situation, 
&#62; it's better to cast a town portal.  Cast it away from the monsters 
&#62; and then die.  Restart in town and then use portal to start away from 
&#62; the baddies for a possible monster-luring-joyride 
&#62; 
&#62; May your items never hit the floor again.....

  Thanks for the apology--not really necessary; I probably would have 
said the same things!!
  That phasing/teleport thingy was from memory; I hadn't checked your 
post just before writing, but I think someone else had suggested that,
and it stuck in my memory . . .

Just to give you a bit more details about my fateful night, when I
had donned my backup stuff, I had no intention of fighting, just 
running in, grabbing my stuff, and running back.  However, we died far
enough from the stairs to be a pain, but close enough for the baddies 
to see me as soon as i came down.  I had to try to fight thru a couple
that were blocking my way; I actualy succeeded, but got lava'd into 
oblivion (before I could even suck down a potion--with my finger on
the dam button, to boot!!! &&&#37;&(&#37;)*^)*&&#37;&#37;&&#37;)
I actually did try to go down naked, just to run, grab, run, tp, 
run down again, etc.  I was immediately swamped,and could not even 
quaff more than one potion; I NEVER would have been able to cast 
any spells.

I think your ideas for recovering stuff are great; in fact, I had used
similar methods to recover stuff with the same character (and even in
nm/caves--same area, 1 level up!!) with 100&#37; success (and about 
100
deaths).  Not a chance this time!!!  DOUGHDOUGHDUP!!!

May your stuff not hit the floor either--if it does, let it 
be away from the stairs  &#60;sniff&#62;,
