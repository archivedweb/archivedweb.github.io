&#62; Aahzmadius must a told you last night I was going to post this 
&#62; message today. I hope you didn't post your one below in an effort to 
&#62; &#34;beat me to the punch&#34;..... doesn't matter.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; I'm tired of all the arguments I get into with you. Most of my posts 
&#62; seem to gather alot of interest expecially my last survey. I got alot 
&#62; of mail from people who enjoyed that (44 replies last time I counted, 
&#62; darn near a record). I think alot of people enjoy our little 
&#62; &#34;debate&#34; but I think we are going too far.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Anyway I will state my position 1 last time for everyone: I am an old 
&#62; timer. I detested cheaters. Cheating started the day diablo came out, 
&#62; long before anyone ever &#34;created&#34; a cheat. Anyone remember 
&#62; &#34;Modem drop dup&#34;? How about &#34;Portal Dup&#34;? These 
&#62; existed from the beginning and people took advantage of them. I hated 
&#62; them for it. I was a purist.
&#62; 
&#62; As the cheating escalated in later months, the programmer side of me 
&#62; (I'm a lead game programmer if anyone doesn't already know) began to 
&#62; really get interested in how alot of these simple cheats worked. I 
&#62; began to explore their methods and actually talked with their 
&#62; creators. I talked to Enigma, Andy Duplain and others. It was 
&#62; facinating to me. 
&#62; 
&#62; At my work, with Diablo cheating making all the news, I was asked to 
&#62; explore how these cheats work and create a model of a game that was 
&#62; cheat proof that could be used in future projects.
&#62; 
&#62; Somewhere around this time, I began backing up my char due to a 
&#62; flakey system. I knew it was cheating but I rationalized that as long 
&#62; as I don't restore my char after loosing items to creatures, it's 
&#62; really not &#34;cheating&#34; .... yea right *wink wink nudge 
&#62; nudge*&#60;g&#62;.
&#62; 
&#62; In the world of Tristram, me in my Awsome Plate, I beat Nightmare 
&#62; mode solo. I then beat Hell mode solo. Soon after, I became very good 
&#62; making solo Hell Hell runs. Although always a challenge, my 
&#62; experience was enough I knew when something was impossible and to 
&#62; retreat, or when to continue. I learned alot of tricks to stay alive. 
&#62; Armor actually became irrelevant in my method of gameplay as I was 
&#62; more akin to a mage than warrior. Spells and a Bow are everything.
&#62; 
&#62; I began to want something fresh so I began playing the single player 
&#62; game. On my first try, I was able to start in the church with a new 
&#62; char and work my way slowly, all the way down to Diablo and kill him. 
&#62; The quests were really cool so I continued to play, wanting to see 
&#62; each and every char. I wanted to learn EVERYTHING about Diablo a fire 
&#62; was kindled in me to know all. 
&#62; 
&#62; At a rare moment, I found an OZ, at another, GPOW from wirt. I always 
&#62; knew QPOW was the armor of choice for dupers and wanted to try it. I 
&#62; imported it back over to my Multiplayer char and started 
&#62; experimenting. I got a GCOW from wirt and shortly there after a GHOW 
&#62; from wirt again. I tried an experiment to see what a 500hp rogue 
&#62; would be like. I was very disappointed. But, call me lazy, I still 
&#62; kept the GPOW on my multiplayer char and continued playing, having 
&#62; fun.
&#62; 
&#62; By this time, cheating was in a frenzy and I became very flexible to 
&#62; cheats. I never have believed in the hardcore cheats like AutoKill, 
&#62; TownKill, GodMode, 256 level Spells, LeachKill and such. I started 
&#62; meeting alot of people who had dups to no end and as we played... it 
&#62; was still fun, NO I take that back, it was a HELL of a lot of fun. 
&#62; They always died several times to my 1 because I had the better 
&#62; experience, but it was still enjoyable.
&#62; 
&#62; I figured that hey, as long as they aren't trying to PK me, they 
&#62; aren't distracting from my fun... in fact, alot of times they added 
&#62; to it.
&#62; 
&#62; I started digging into the deep roots of Diablo. I have seen the 
&#62; hidden movies. I have seen the hidden Art. I have heard the hidden 
&#62; WAV files. I have see the hidden creatures. Best of all, I have 
&#62; actually PLAYED against the hidden creatures.
&#62; 
&#62; Yes, I am a cheater. I don't care who knows it. My love for Diablo is 
&#62; very great... being able to use the existing cheats to see these 
&#62; marvelous &#34;hidden&#34; things is great. The fact that Raymond 
&#62; figured out how to enable the hidden creatures for game play still 
&#62; amazes me. I have seen more and done more in Diablo that most people 
&#62; ever will. (damn, anyone used that cool Special Effects cheat? Simply 
&#62; incredible)
&#62; I do not agree that all cheats are &#34;evil&#34; though.
&#62; 
&#62; If I were to give advice to anyone starting out in Diablo, I 
&#62; definitely would recommend them to play legit. If they do however, 
&#62; want to learn more about Diablo or use a *gasp* cheat... well its 
&#62; their right. 
&#62; 
&#62; DarkSniper, we will never agree on most issues. I find it ironic that 
&#62; in 3 areas of my survey that I concider cheating, you do not. But, 
&#62; this is a &#34;free&#34; game. I respect your wishes to be legit and 
&#62; wish you well. I only ever wanted the same in return.
&#62; 
&#62; In the end, I'm going to &#34;bury the hachet&#34; on this. I'm not 
&#62; leaving but I do not want to drag out this debate much further. We 
&#62; both opened insights on cheating that the others readily enjoyed.
&#62; 
&#62; Good luck in Diablo, Good luck with your clan. Cheers.
