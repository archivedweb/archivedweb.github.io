<pre>When reading this, please consider this is only regular and Nightmare 
HELL...I have not ventured
into HELL/HELL as of yet because my mage is only level 29.

I play with two others via IPX (a level 26 warrior and 27 rogue).


Well, at first I was killing them a lot with my spells, so I brought 
plenty of res scrolls and such.

Now, we know better.

What we usually do is this...We enter the level and split into two 
groups...I go one way, and
the rogue and warrior another.  If they encounter trouble, I 
immediately do an about face
as they run back towards the center of the level (monsters in tow).

So As I reach them, I assume the monsters are not immune to fire, and 
just put up say 10 firewalls
at their backs so the monsters chasing them have to run through them. 
 If they are NOT immune
to fire as they walk through the fire now is  a good time for chain 
lightning and stone curse.

I stone them, rogue fires, and I chain them to death.

If the monsters make it through the firewalls, we have the fighter 
stand closest to the end
of the walls but off to the side. The monsters usually go for him 
first, and they are usually
much weaker at this point and easy for him to smash.


On the other hand, if I am in trouble (damn those immunities) I'll do 
the same and retreat back
toward the center of the level, I'll continue to run backwards, 
trying to leave a few spells behind
me that should affect the baddies, like a chain up a corridor or two, 
or a guardian or golem.

I'll be met halfway by the rest of the party and we'll have no 
problem.



This isn't really tedious as it may seem, since this is fairly rare. 
I can usually hold my own,
as they can as well.


Sometimes, rarely, we adventure as an entire group.  When this 
happens the technique I like
to employ most (not against FIRE immune creatures) is to let the 
fighter and rogue lead, and
when we encounter monsters to throw 20 guardians behind the baddies. 
They don't hit
my party, and hit the monsters from behind. 20 guardians are pretty 
damn effective. And I get
EXP as well. Against Fire immune creatures I have been using reg. 
lightning after walking safely
out of line with any of the others. It's not as effective as chain 
but I don't hurt the party or fire
at creatures behind walls. And I get EXP.


It all works out pretty well in the end. We split the gold we find, 
and split the items between
whoever needs them. Sure, we have an occasional mishap here and 
there, but we are usually
pretty well coordinated.

Ok, well...the guy who plays the rogue tends to start screaming from 
time to time:
  &#34;OH CRAP! I'm dying! I'm dying! NO NO NO NO!&#34; and when he 
gets all frantic like that
he tends to lose the team aspect of the game and tries to quickly 
kill everything but he always
winds up dying...so besides that, we do fairly well. And if one of us 
dies, we all have res
scrolls, so it's not too much of a problem...
