&#62;   OK, since the subject came up a couple of messages down, I thought 
&#62; I'd toss in my nickel's worth.

Based on observations made both as a warrior and a mage, the best 
thing a warror can do is &#34;always move slowly and deliberly&#34;. 
Don't go charging from one side of a battle to another seeking things 
to hit... you'll invariably run into someone's field of fire. A 
warrior should follow one of two tactics:

1. If facing melee creatures move slightly ahead and to one side of 
the ROP (Rest Of Party). By doing this the melee creatures should 
target you... not the rogue/mage. Because you are off slightly to one 
side they should both have missle opprotunities while the creatures 
close. Once they close -- DON'T MOVE! Stand you're ground and hack 
away. This will allow your rogue/mage to target other creatures (such 
as the witches) without hitting you. A good rogue can line-up and 
pick-off some of the creatures swarming you without worrying about 
hitting you -- PROVIDED YOU DON'T MOVE. However, for this to work, 
two things need to be established. You need an AC/Blocking/Haromony 
sufficient to be swarmed without falling immediately (more on this 
below). Also, you need to let your parterns know how many &#34;at 
once&#34; you can handle. They should watch what swarms you and if 
your &#34;at once&#34; level is exceeded should start stone cursing 
to help you. They should not stone curse unless your &#34;at 
once&#34; level is exceeded... its a waste of mana and condecending 
(look guys, I can handle one lone blood knight... OK?).

2. If facing ranged creatures like witches and advocates, either 
stand back and let the rogues/mages take them. This is often best 
because when the warrior advances to engage these creatures he 
usually just activates more trouble. If you must engage, then pick a 
wall and move along it taking out anything in your path. By doing 
this you move predicably... so the rogues/mages can adjust for your 
actions and not fry you. Also, you leave the center of the room free 
to fill up with wizzing arrows and fireballs -- it's really not a 
place you want to be.

Notes on AC: By my experiences, a warrior with a Harmony item, a 
regular-speed shield, and an AC &#62;= 170 can stand up to just about 
any number of melee types (knights/vipers/etc.) in normal/hell. He'll 
take damage and use potions from his belt -- but he won't immediately 
fold. I had to get my AC up around 250 to gain similar staying power 
in nightmare/hell.  I estimate I'll need fast block and an AC up over 
300 for hell/hell -- though I'm just guessing. With my champions 
sword of haste (bastard) I can take any creature on one-on-one or 
even two-on-one in hell/hell -- but I can't yet stand up to being 
swarmed. As I said above, if you are below these protection 
&#34;thresholds&#34;, you have to let your parterns know when to step 
in and help you. Likewise, they need to know you aren't quite the 
&#34;speed bump&#34; they remember all those dupers to be.
