<pre>Hello,

I read your post and felt the need to respond:

I know you have been recruited by Guilds/Clans and seem to think they 
are all the same, basically.  If so, you are greatly mistaken.  I 
suggest you take a look at the Saints of the True Cross.  We are 
about 100 strong, but are very selective about whom we recruit and 
whom we keep after the probationary period.  We had rather have one 
good, law-abiding, decent, non-cheater, (as you seem to be) than a 
thousand half-hearted, apathetic, middle-of-the-roaders.  Check the 
site and visit our library.  Apply if you wish, though recruiting has 
been put on hold until our web site is refurbished.  I liked your 
spirit and your words.  I think you would make a good Saint and your 
interest in playing Diablo would revive.  I rarely ask anyone to 
join, but you seem to have the qualifications, so I ventured to offer.

Our website is at: <a href="http://www.ihap.com/saints">http://www.ihap.com/saints</a>

Or email me at:  danomac@mail.starrlink.com

I would be glad to answer any questions you may have.  I hope you 
find what you are looking for.

Good Journeys!

&#62; ****Now My Frustration*****

&#62;  What do you think?  Am I a cheater in your eyes due to my stuff?  
&#62; Should I expect the response I get?  Are most legit people too 
&#62; paranoid?  I miss the days when I can drop the king's swords on the 
&#62; ground and be safe to play with others.  I'm becoming very unhappy 
&#62; and frustrated legit player.  Please give me, some of your thoughts.  
&#62; I'm beginning to think about Retiring Diablo complete. :(</pre>
