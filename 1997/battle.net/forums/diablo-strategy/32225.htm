<blockquote>
<pre>I assume that ideas like this have been posted before.  However, I'm 
fairly new to this forum, and I haven't seen one quite like it 
(perhaps it was an early spellcasting class that I missed?), so I 
thought I'd post something for the people out there who are new to 
the forum also.  I apologize for any repitition to you veteran forum 
readers.

I've used a mage for awhile, and so I know a little about the 
subject.  Please keep in mind that the following ideas are based on 
the assumption that the group will be staying together (you can 
always use a mage in a divide and conquer scenario, but this isn't 
really &#34;multi-player&#34; adventuring).  Also, note that this is 
written from the mage's point of view.  For the most part, the other 
members of the group are left on the periphery for the purposes of 
this discussion.  This is not to slight them in any way, I'm simply 
applying the focus to the mage here.  In fact, I will simply use ROP 
(Rest of Party) to abbreviate for those adventuring with the mage.  
Also, the party make-up is assumed to have only one sorcerer.  As 
some others have stated, I also feel that more than one mage is not 
only overkill, but also inefficient.

When you get into any kind of group tactics, all members must be 
disciplined.  If you start changing strategies without telling your 
comrades, chaos can ensue.  Therefore, for the following to work, all 
members must be on the &#34;same page,&#34; and stick to tactics 
consistently.  Another assumption made below is that mana use is 
irrelevant.  That is, little consideration is given to how 
efficiently different strategies will use mana.  So, depending on the 
mage, one might have to slightly alter one of the strategies, or even 
abandon it altogether.

One final caveat is that most of my adventuring is done in hell- 
particularly hell/hell.  Keep in mind that my point of view tends to 
be skewed in the direction of strategies that work there.  Of course, 
the following list is NOT meant to be comprehensive, simply some 
suggested ways of playing.  With all that in mind, please enjoy.

1)  DESCRIPTION:  Stone curse everything and let ROP deal out all 
damage
      MARCHING ORDER:  Typically ROP in front with mage behind, but 
mage can lead on occasion
     ADVANTAGES:
       a) Safe for all members of the group.  With no 18th-level 
Fireballs or Chain flying around, risk of friendly fire is very low.  
Since most monsters don't move for very long, they will not inflict 
much damage on the party.
     DISADVANTAGES:
       a)  The biggest drawback, of course, is that the mage gets no 
experience using this method.
       b)  This method is very tedious for the mage.  You must be 
very disciplined to use this strategy.  It's really tempting to let 
loose with Fireball or Chain, but you can't;  keep those spells in 
your pocket.
       c)  Sometimes other members in your group will feel guilty 
because they know you're not getting any XP, and they will be 
reluctant to stick with this strategy.

      COMMENTS:
         This is still the method I prefer, and the method I use the 
most often (and, thus, it's the one I know the most about).  
Sometimes I will break the monotony if we come upon a small room and 
activate some of the monsters by the doorway.  After I've stoned the 
creatures at the entrance of the room, I'll Teleport inside to the 
corner of the room and let loose with some Fireballs or Chain.  This 
is safe since ROP is still outside the room, so there is little 
chance of friendly fire from the mage hitting them- IF you make sure 
that you're in the very corner.  You get to let loose a little bit, 
blow a few things up, and then can regroup and go back to stoning 
exclusively.  One warning though:  Only Teleport blindly if you have 
good AC and an item of Harmony.
          Also, this strategy may not work well for low-level groups 
since the mage will be limited in the amount of mana he has, and will 
probably be casting a Stone Curse that is in the 50s for casting 
cost.  50 versus 40 doesn't sound like much of a difference, but when 
you add it up over time, it is certainly significant.
           In a group of only two, this can also be a slow strategy.  
With only one person to deal out the damage, it may take two or even 
three stones for some monsters before your companion can finally do 
away with all of them.  So, this will probably be a little better for 
groups of 3 or 4.
          I know what you're thinking:  Aahz, how can you endorse 
this strategy?  You've listed only one advantage and three 
disadvantages.  You've admitted that it may be slow, and you'll never 
level-up doing this.  The answer is easy:  in this case the one 
advantage outweighs the three disadvantages (for me, anyway).  It's 
like this:  no one wants to be in the dungeon with a trigger-happy 
mage.  Once you start throwing some accidental PK's into the mix, 
nobody will WANT to adventure with you.  After that, you don't need 
to worry about multi-player tactics anymore:  solo will be all that 
you need to know.
          As far as the experience goes, I will always say that if 
you want XP as a mage, play alone.  It's more efficient when you're 
by yourself because you can let loose with your spells and fly 
(literally) through levels.  However, for those of you who want to 
gain experience with your mage in a group, please read further.     

2)  DESCRIPTION:  Sorcerer leads and fires spells at monsters.  Once 
the monsters get into melee range, he Teleports behind ROP and goes 
into defensive mode; i.e. Stone Curse and Heal Other.  
      MARCHING ORDER:  Mage in front of ROP initially, then behind 
ROP as monsters close in.
      ADVANTAGES:
        a)  All members of group get experience
        b)  As long as party does not prematurely move in front of 
mage, chance of friendly fire is relatively low
      DISADVANTAGES:
        a)  Somewhat risky, since the mage throwing Chain out in 
front can potentially activate too many monsters at once for the 
party to handle
        b)  Requires a lot of judgment by all members of the party.  
Specifically, the party must get accustomed to the timing of when the 
mage should retreat and ROP advance.  Anytime you have more than one 
person trying to make timing judgments, errors are likely to occur.  
(Particularly when b.net is jumping monsters around on every player's 
screen).
        c)  Once a mage gets to a high-enough level, very few 
monsters ever make it to melee range- thus defeating the purpose of 
group adventuring.

      COMMENTS:
          Overall, this is probably the best strategy for low-level 
groups.  Everyone gets involved, everyone learns tactics, and you'll 
get a feel for how the other members of your party play right away.  
Of course, errors will be made in the beginning, but if you can 
overcome these all members will benefit relatively equally.
          You have to be careful with this one, though.  It's very 
easy to mess up the timing of when the mage is to retreat and ROP to 
advance.  Also, you have to set aside your ego here if you're the 
mage.  It's tempting to still be throwing spells as the monsters 
close in, because you KNOW that just one more click of the mouse will 
dispatch them.  You have to keep your companions in mind and LAY OFF 
as the monsters close in; otherwise ROP will have no fun.  
Additionally, if the mage retreats too soon, the party may be 
overwhelmed by too many monsters.  It's kind of a delicate balance, 
and this is why I say that learning the timing can be tricky.  Of 
course, if you adventure with the same players regularly, your group 
will get a better idea of the habits of each other, thus facilitating 
the effectiveness of the group by reducing the number of judgment 
errors.
          I like this one since all members get to kill monsters, but 
since I think it's the hardest one to implement effectively, I tend 
not to use it.

3)  DESCRIPTION:  Division based on monster immunity.  The mage kills 
all monsters that will fall to his Fireball, but leaves the fire-
immunes to ROP.
      MARCHING ORDER:  To reduce likelihood of friendly fire, mage 
should lead- unless, of course, ALL monsters on a given level are 
fire-immune.
      ADVANTAGES:
        a)  If you play enough games together, XP will be nearly even 
for all members of party.
        b)  All members of group get to deal out damage occasionally, 
increasing the fun.
      DISADVANTAGES:
        a)  All members of the group MUST be aware of magic 
resistances/immunities of ALL monsters they will encounter.  
INSTANTLY aware.
        b)  In a single-game setting, the XP distribution may be 
highly unbalanced.

      COMMENTS:
          Obviously, this strategy is only going to work with veteran 
players.  Even more obvious is the fact that it will primarily only 
be useful in hell.  I suppose you could make some other arbitrary 
division in the initial levels of the dungeon where magic immunities 
are less of a concern, but I think this would be somewhat vague at 
times.  And whenever you have vagueness, you have hesitation and 
confusion, and these will potentially lead to PK's and MK's.  The 
reason I see vagueness as a problem is that you won't be sure what 
kind of monsters are on a level until you've progressed into that 
level a little ways.  Additionally, the upper levels have more of a 
variety of monsters on each level.  So, you might be saying, 
&#34;I'll take the Goat Archers, you take the Bats.&#34;  But then 
you turn another corner and some melee Goatmen come charging towards 
the group.  This could lead to some momentary confusion, and thus 
could lead to some deaths in the party.
        Let me expand on the disadvantage that says all players must 
be instantly aware of the monsters' immunities.  Imagine a mage and 
warrior in the same group.  The party walks into a room and there are 
Snow Witches up in a corner.  The warrior immediately steps in front 
of the mage in his eagerness to slice up the witches.  However, the 
mage has already targeted the Snow Witches as fire-susceptibles and 
lets loose with his Fireball.  The poor warrior has now received the 
brunt of a Fireball right in the back, and you've got an unfortunate, 
accidental PK.  Bummer.  
         However, imagine a second scenario.  This time, you walk 
into a room and several Doom Guards approach.  The mage doesn't use a 
Fireball since he knows it will be useless (on hell difficulty).  
However, the warrior doesn't realize this right away, and so hangs 
back.  NOW you've got a problem, because there are 5 knights on the 
way to impale the mage.  Several things could happen at this point, 
but a very dangerous scenario is that  the mage panics and retreats; 
however, the warrior belatedly realizes he is supposed to step in.  
And now the WARRIOR  has 5 swords swinging at him and no Stone Curse 
support.  Bad news in hell/hell.  This is why I feel that all members 
must be instantly aware of magic immunities.  (Yes, I know that some 
warriors know magic immunities just as well as their sorcerer 
buddies.  However, in my experience this is the exception rather than 
the rule).
         I have been thinking about this strategy for awhile, but 
have yet to use it consistently.  I'll be trying it this weekend with 
Jim-Man!, so I'll let you know how it ends up working out.  I have a 
feeling that as long as the players are experienced, it should be 
very effective.


     Well, those are the three that I'm going to cover in this post.  
I know that I left out an obvious  one:  The sorcerer kills all 
things with ranged attacks and leaves the melee monsters to his 
buddies.  The reason I omitted this strategy is that it becomes 
pretty much irrelevant if a mage is traveling with rogues.  
Additionally, it doesn't ever work on level 16 of hell/hell, since 
the Advocates there are triple-immunes. 

  Some other general comments on using a sorcerer:

     I personally have never been a proponent of the Heal Other 
spell.  In my opinion, it is usually a waste of mana.  The way I see 
it, when I've played my warrior I have a much better idea of where my 
hit points are at, and I can hit the potion hotkey at the most 
opportune time.  A sorcerer standing back and watching my hit points 
on his screen will not have access to the information as quickly as 
I, the warrior, do.  Therefore, many of his Heal Other casts are 
coming after I've already hit the potion button.  This is a waste of 
mana.  Additionally, if, as the warrior, I'm waiting for the mage to 
heal me and the spell comes too late, I will see my screen turn red- 
and I will be much less likely to wait for the spell again in the 
future.  I'm not saying that it is a totally useless strategy, I just 
find that, in general, it is inefficient.  (Especially on the higher 
difficulty levels when monsters are doing mega-damage).
     I also have never been a proponent of changing around your spell 
hotkeys when playing in a group- as opposed to their setup when 
you're playing alone.  In general, this causes confusion and 
frustration when you cast the wrong spell.  I suppose that there are 
people who are more coordinated than I am, but I almost NEVER change 
my hotkey setup.  It is now a reaction for me to switch to the exact 
spell I want.  I switch between my four spells automatically without 
giving them a thought.  And I almost never choose the wrong one.  
     I know that some people will replace Fireball with Firebolt and 
Chain Lightning with Lightning in multi-player.  I don't even do 
this.  The problem I have run into in the past is that the rest of my 
party will die, and the monsters will advance on me.  Now I'm stuck 
with these lousy low-damage spells while the horde closes in.  I'd 
just as soon Stone Curse the monsters to keep my friends alive.  
However, if they do die, I won't be in as much danger of falling to 
the bad-uns also.
     Always carry Resurrect scrolls when adventuring with others.  
Hey, realistically, the occasional PK is going to happen when you're 
throwing around high-level spells.  Be a good friend and correct your 
error quickly and conveniently.  Don't make your comrades Restart in 
Town and then have to enter a portal to get back into the fray.
     One other tactic that I think gets over-looked is when to Stone 
Curse.  (Again, apologies, Lok, if you've already covered this).  If 
you don't want to activate a lot of monsters, let the melee creatures 
get almost on top of your warrior friends before you Stone them.  
Obviously, your friends have to put some faith in you, but eventually 
it will work better.  If you start Stone Cursing as soon as you see 
the two knights on the edge of your screen, the warriors have to 
advance to kill them.  This potentially could result in more knights 
getting activated, or, even worse, witches will start shooting at 
your warriors from behind the knights.  Now you've got witches firing 
away at your buddies, but your warriors are in your line of fire.  
Not a good scenario, particularly in hell/hell.  Try to stay patient 
and let the knights and vipers come to you.

Now for some requests on input:

1)  First, I'd like to see some replies from other sorcerers.  What 
do you agree with in this post?  Even better, what do you think is 
total hogwash?  Let's hear about other strategies you use or which of 
my disadvantages are really advantages.

2)  I'd also like to hear from you prominent warriors and rogues.  
How do you like your mage friends to play?  What spells do you like 
to see them cast?  Which spells or tactics make you want to fill them 
full of arrows or cut off their ear with your sword?

3)  I don't want to see any posts saying, &#34;The best way for a 
mage to play is to use Apocalypse because it doesn't hurt the other 
players.&#34;  I respectfully request that you gamers who have 255 
charges of Apoc on your staff refrain from posting replies to this.

Whoa, it is REALLY late now (for me).  I know this was long, but 
since Boots and Dizzy were asking for multi-player tactics, I thought 
I'd better throw one in.  Thanks to all who are still reading at this 
point.

Happy adventuring, all,
