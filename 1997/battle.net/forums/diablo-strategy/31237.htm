&#62;  You mean Fire_made_Flesh does not do much, next time type properly 
&#62; for important things.
&#62; 
&#62;  When FMF started his clan, he did most on his own(whats that Twig? 
&#62; Sorry I'm deaf in one ear). He did a lot for this clan, and he still 
&#62; does. It will be an unfair accusation to say he does not do much. 
&#62; Where did you get that idea from anyway?

why dont u read his post above??? he said it himself! he doesnt have 
to do much cos hes got others to do the page and others to watch the  
guild. i never said he didnt do anything in the beginning, of course 
he did, he started th clan! but a good leader should always do the 
best for his or her clan.

&#62;  I have respect for Fire_made_Flesh(more than you hee hee),

do i care? i dont even know u.

 he has 
&#62; made mistakes many times, but then so has I. He got the guild running 
&#62; much by itself, if that isn't a sign of leadership I don't know what 
&#62; is. In fact, some of the members insisted on taking the 
&#62; responsibilities, they wanted to do something for the clan, they do 
&#62; not want to have a free ride, FMF needs help, they volunteered. Some 
&#62; of the clan members still want to take some things of FMF's hand, but 
&#62; FMF refused and now he's still kept busy maintaining the clan. He is 
&#62; like a boss, a manager, you have the wrong impression of him.

maybe he should be a bit more clear in his post then.

&#62;  Perhaps you should know that FMF is one of the most knowlegable (on 
&#62; Diablo) person I know of. For instance, do you know that you you can 
&#62; get all 3 dots just from killing  Diablo in hell diff, there is no 
&#62; need for normal and nightmare.

ahhhh, yes. but what the hell does that have to do with building a 
clan?

 I and he knew this months ago, and his 
&#62; knowledge of the game is one reason I joined his clan. There are a 
&#62; lot more tricks for this game of course, some I think only I know. :)
&#62;  
&#62;  Angels Of Hell, not a spiffy name, do you have screenings? I don't 
&#62; know much about your clan either. 
&#62;  Having another clan just spreads the legits out more, why create? 
&#62; Join! Hah! not to you Darksniper, u already got one. I should have 
&#62; responded to your post about &#34;What is a good clan to join?&#34; 
&#62; 
&#62;  Mana-Flux(BP) 
&#62;  I'm getting bored of Diablo, UO UO wherest thou?
&#62;  PS: have you been to Diablo Information

u r getting quite annoying u know. i mean critisize me if u follow 
the whole thing. if u dont just shut the hell up!
