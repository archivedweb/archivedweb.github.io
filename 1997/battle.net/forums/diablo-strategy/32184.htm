<pre>     Yeah, Yeah, I know this discussion's been over for pages, but I 
justhad to give my veiwpoint.  I was bored, so I went back to page 12 
& 13 and read the Rogues vs. Mages debate.  This is my conclusion:

     NO CLASS IS BETTER THAN THE OTHERS

     It all depends on your personal preferences and playing 
style(s).  I, personally, have played all three classes and have 
found the Warrior to be my favorite.  It's not that he's BETTER, I 
just LIKE him more.  Rogues get pigeonholed into using bows (Which 
isn't a bad thing, BTW, I just can't use bows - firing angles and 
such) while Sorcerors get boring after lvl 28 or so (go down, mana 
shield, find monsters, stone curse, chain lightning...).

     The Warrior not only is the tough guy (and thus can take hits 
from trigger-happy players in multi) but is virtually no danger to 
his companions!  You ever seen a Warrior with his swords uncrossed 
hit a friend by accident?  I've never, not even the big lummoxes in 
public games.

     Yes, the Warrior takes a dive in Mana and Magic, but with the 
right items and a good weapon &#34;of Vampires&#34; (My trusty 
&#34;Vlad&#34; hehehe) he can still roll out the spells...  Take my 
example when I go into Hell: Hotkey Healing and just hack, hack, 
heal, hack, hack, heal... It's kinda funny sometimes 8).

     Rogues and Sorcerors, on the other hand, are VERY dangerous if 
the player doesn't know what he/she is doing.  Ever seen a mage 
&#34;help&#34; you out by chucking fireballs at the Knight your 
fighting?  I have, it's not fun.  And then there are Rogues who pay 
no attention whatsoever to where the Warrior is.  I admitt that a LOT 
of Warriors will barge through the Rogues' Line-of-Fire and expect 
her to stop (Yeah right!).  Savvy Warriors (Myself included) will let 
the rogue have her fun and take out enemies on OUR side of the line.

     Well, I hope that finally cleared up the issue! In conclusion:

          NO CLASS IS BEST
          PERSONAL PREFERENCE SHOULD DECIDE THE CLASS YOU PLAY
          SOME CLASSES DO NOT DO WELL WITH CERTAIN STRATEGIES/TACTICS
          CERTAIN STRATEGIES/TACTICS WORK BETTER FOR SOME CLASSES</pre>
