&#62; I like fantasy role playing games and because of that, I bought 
&#62; Diablo.   Well, it is a good game, but I am confusing on resistances. 
&#62;  What is magic resistance?  I understand fire/lightning.  What if I 
&#62; got hit by firebolt or fireball, what resistance will effect for 
&#62; that?  Fire?  Magic?  Both?  Since it is a MAGIC fires, I think magic 
&#62; should effect for that.  If not, what is really MAGIC?  Other fantagy 
&#62; games including board games, if some skeleton is immune to magic, no 
&#62; magic can give damage including any fire/lightning magics but some 
&#62; holy magics.  (At least, according to stories that I have read).  
&#62; Please anybody make sure that for me.

Magic resistance is resistance to attacks that are magically created 
but fit into neither of the other two categories. For example, when 
you get hit by that fireball, and you have max magic resistance, your 
ass will still get fried. However, if someone tosses Flash or Stone 
Curse at you, the only thing that can save you is magic resistance.
&#62; 
&#62; P.S.  I am little bit disappointed about diablo because there are 
&#62; some Japan styles.  Such as rising sun (means Japanese flag), some 
&#62; samurai weapon-like items, and taking ear when you kill other player 
&#62; (Do you know Japanese solders took their victims left ear while they 
&#62; took Korea in World War II?).  Why I don't like Japan style is 
&#62; because they changed some image of fantagy world.</pre>
