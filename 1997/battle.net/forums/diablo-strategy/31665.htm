<blockquote>
<pre>#). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
      Depends.  I suppose if it's a small amount, say, a few hundred 
or less, it's not cheating.  However, entire piles of 5000 gold is 
defenitely cheating.
 
&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?
      YES!  You shouldn't grab stuff that you couldn't normally find 
on your own.  You won't better your character if you're hanging in 
town scarfing up zodiacs(which may have come from dupers anyway).

#). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
     YES, for almost the same reasons as the last question.  If you 
couldn't normally afford it, you shouldn't have it.

#). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
elixers?
     YES.  Again, Diablo is not about chugging elixirs in town.  
You're supposed to paste demons and goat archers until your stats go 
up.  Later, when you are a high level and have gold, it's alright to 
have a drink or twenty.

&#62; &#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
     NO.  The low guy isn't going to accomplish anything, but it's 
not really cheating; you're allowed to play with whomever you want.
 
#). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
Adria or Griz for items?
     YES.  You're supposed to be taking your chances in a dungeon 
with whatever you find, not making raids on the same boss 50 times 
for items.

#). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
     YES, but I would do it given the chance because of the sad state 
of battle.net, just like I used TownKill.  Both are for self-defense 
against more flagrant cheating: PKillers.  By checking stats, 
cheaters are usually easy to find(and to avoid later).  TownKill I 
used so that if I was attacked in town, I could defend myself.  It's 
sad that you have to do that stuff just to level the playing field.

 #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
could not regularly access?
     NO.  They'll probably get their arse kicked anyway(unless 
they've got hacked items, in which case I wouldn't want to play with 
them).

#). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
items?
    YES.  Make do with the space you've got.  Decide what you're 
keeping, selling, and dropping once and for all.  Nobody said life 
was easy.

&#62;#). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another 
char?
    NO, as long as there are no magic weapons or armor being 
transferred.  Resurrection scrolls are alright, as are normal healing 
or mana potions.  These items' lasting effect on your character is 
little or nothing.
   YES, if the item drastically affects any of the receivers' stats.

#). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
      NO.  You're following the rules.  You may be an arsehole, but 
at least you're not being a ghost.  A wily player should be able to 
defend himself after the first Nova blows.   

#). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
    NO.  It's just another inventive PKill strategy.  Any street-
smart player should be aware of this and other dangers.

 
#). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
    YES, however I said before that I've used that cheat in the name 
of self-defense.  If you are using it as I do(in case someone else is 
using it to attack you), I'd have to say I can't blame you.  

 #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
    NO.  Crap happens, and you've got to be ready for it.  A great 
deal of time and effort is put into a rocking Diablo character, and 
there's no reason you shouldn't want to protect it against loss.</pre>
