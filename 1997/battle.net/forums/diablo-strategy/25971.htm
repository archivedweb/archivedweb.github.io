&#62; &#62; I dont know what the odds are for finding &#34;The Rainbow Clock&#34;

&#62; &#62; strange that it would be just sitting in the corner. If i had not 
&#62; &#62; been so greedy me and my friends would have passed it up. We where 
&#62; &#62; playing new charicters and it was a  new game. Any one else find 
&#62; &#62; anything like this...?
&#62; 
&#62; That's funny.  Just 2 days ago, I found the 'Falcon's Talon' or 
&#62; something like that on the first level/normal difficulty.  I was 
&#62; wondering about the gold items.  I was playing with a mage for a long 
&#62; time (I got up to level 36, and started needing like 20M x.p. to 
&#62; level up, geesh!)  Anyways, I was never finding much good stuff, and 
&#62; almost never a 'gold' item, good or bad.  Then, the other day, I made 
&#62; a 1st level fighter, and by the time I cleared out the church I had 
&#62; found 4 gold items!  They were the Falcon's Talon thing, the Holy 
&#62; Avenger shield, the Celestial Star, and something else but I can't 
&#62; remember.  But what gives!  Is there better stuff when you're just 
&#62; starting out?
&#62; 
&#62; Well, anyways, to answer your question, yes.
&#62; Tino

I had a similar experience in the church.  I found the Holy Defender 
and I think a couple of other unique weapons.  I remember one being 
the Ice Shaft or some name like that and I don't remember the other.  
But since then, even in lower levels of the dungeons, my luck has 
been pitiful.  Well, it's bound to turn around sometime.</pre>
