<pre>I think this happens all the time (at least to me). I get this effect
whenever the game (or system) decides to flush lots of data to the
disk. While the disk drive is busy, the game would pause for 2 or 3
seconds, then resume in the 'catch-up' mode for 2 or 3 seconds. This
cycle usually last about 15-20 seconds. Strange that most of the time,
this happens right at the start of a fight - which is bad because, I 
can't
do anything for a 2-3 seconds and the next thing I know, I'm 
surrounded
by monsters.

Here's another strange thing that's happen to me a few times. I walk
into an area and a bunch of bloodstars comes flying at me. So I dodge 
the
stars and advance to find the witches - only the volley of stars 
eventually
ends and there are no witches around or they're dead already (maybe
killed off screen somehow?).

&#62; I typically play Diablo with a laptop multiplayer solo.  The laptop

&#62; giving me a hard time lately (doesn't seat properly).  Last night I
&#62; was in the normal/caverns when the CD decided to cut out.  I spent
&#62; about two minutes trying to get it to re-seat and read again.  When
&#62; I got the game to come up again, the game decided to play catch-up
&#62; mode for about the next two minutes.  Anytime I would &#34;click&#34; 
&#62; on the
&#62; screen, she would run over like Speedy Gonzalez, and if you think
&#62; the rogue normally fires pretty quick, Watch Out!  I opened a door
&#62; to a room full of archer stone-clansmen.  Before I could get off my
&#62; first shot, I got a barage of about 30 arrows flying my way, and got
&#62; nailed by about 5 or 6 of them.  Ouch, that stings!  But, then it was
&#62; fun to watch her go into machine gun mode when I started clicking on
&#62; targets.  In any respect, it added a new twist to the game.  I just
&#62; wouldn't want to play it that way all the time.  I think that Pentium
&#62; would smoke me pretty fast if it always had that kind of advantage.
