<pre>To all,

       Arrggg, I'm so frustrated!!!  I have been playing for now 4 
months (too long perhaps).  I been there and done that.  Joined Clans 
and Guilds, I got sick of their some stupid rule that was practically 
cheating or Masters that themselves are cheaters.  I have met 
reformed cheaters (now really great legit players).  Cheated once, 
not knowing (stupid newbiew I was once. Had to destroy a lvl 32 Mage, 
that was hardest).  Found treasure beyond others eyes have seen (I 
play too much, but nvr seen a strange bastard sword of Haste yet).  
Met friends, who I wish come back to Diablo again to helping each 
other out (still have a few left).  Been Pked so many times, then I 
learned to play private games.  Met people who showed me some 
skilles.  I aquired some myself.

      To illustrate my position, I'm posting what I have:
Bastard Swords:
      Soldiers sword of Blood
      King's sword of Haste (gave a broad version away)
      King's sword of Vampire
      King's sword of Titan
      King's sword of Gore
      King's sword of Sorcery
      Champion's sword of Haste
King's Flail of Haste
3 StormShield
2 Gotther (unided)
1 Helm of Sprits
1 Helm of Royal Circlet (gave one away)
1 Thinking cap (gave 2 away)
1 Naj's plate
I have AAA(12 charges) AA resurrect(10 charges) AA Fireball (56 
charges)
Tons of rings about 5 Zodiac.
1 obs of wiz (40&#37; 27magic)
1 obs of lion (40&#37; 55 hp)
1 obs (40&#37;)
1 constricting ring. and etc
1 windforce
I have seen AAN, AAW(+30), tossed Dreamflanges, cause I like AA 
better and have strong weapon and sheild for triple immues), lots of 
apocs, and etc.
have 3 awesome plates. (1 has 19 dex added, another with max ac of 
183)
I admit, I'm very luck, probably one of the luckiest.  It was painful 
to be legit, but I'm one and love playing Diablo they way it was 
meant to be.  Taking time to know people, find out some were cheat 
some were more hardcore legit them I'm (the purists))  I'm now going 
to a channel where legit players are at.  Some guilds come and go.  
Only 2 Guild are very strong.  


****Now My Frustration*****
What the hell is wrong with legit players.  Why are they so paranoid 
that they can't accept the possibility of other people can have 
better stuff and better skill.  I personally found a zodiac in cave 
with my rogue(in her early lvl when she couldn't even go in to hell). 
Is it wrong to keep a very powerful items. People, who don't know me 
well, are starting to accused me of cheater, because I have such 
powerful and rare items and don't die in even in a situation which 
most would die due to skill (I think).  I know I shouldn't care (most 
part I don't) but since I'm not in a guild or clan, which I don't 
want to {(Many did try to recruite me, some even wanted me to be a 
hunter. hehe, I rarely duel,(once perhaps I think), I rather play 
coop anyday then to duel (I hate the sound of ear drop :p )} so I 
have to find a game to play but It's getting harder and harder as My 
lvl rises.  (I trade between my chars, but has to be equal of value). 
 What do you think?  Am I a cheater in your eyes due to my stuff?  
Should I expect the response I get?  Are most legit people too 
paranoid?  I miss the days when I can drop the king's swords on the 
ground and be safe to play with others.  I'm becoming very unhappy 
and frustrated legit player.  Please give me, some of your thoughts.  
I'm beginning to think about Retiring Diablo complete. :(</pre>
