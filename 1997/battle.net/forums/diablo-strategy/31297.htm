&#62; &#62; You know, life sucks. Last night I had my *first game ever* on b.net, 
&#62; &#62; and I decided to make it public, in hopes some experienced rogue 
&#62; &#62; would come on and give me some help. I was just about to go into the 
&#62; &#62; church when somebody named &#34;BullDawg_01&#34; or something like 
&#62; &#62; that got on, a warrior in shining black armor and a gleaming shield. 
&#62; &#62; I said I was kind of new at this and any help would be appreciated, 
&#62; &#62; and he said he would help me. I asked him if he cheated, and he said 
&#62; &#62; he didn't. I said &#34;Good.&#34;  So we went into the church. We 
&#62; &#62; were right in front of the stairs, and I said &#34;Any tips&#34; and 
&#62; &#62; he said &#34;Yeah, Cya&#34;. Then he wacked me! Me, a level 1 rogue 
&#62; &#62; with a short bow of extreme crappiness, 100 gold and two healing 
&#62; &#62; potions! He seemed to have a sword of burning (do those exist?) and 
&#62; &#62; he killed me in one blow. I didn't even bother to restart, I just 
&#62; &#62; quit then. I expected more from people, but I didn't get it.
&#62; &#62; I guess I'll have to join a guild if I want to play in safe, 
&#62; &#62; friendly, enjoyable games. Oh well..enough of my woes. See ya later.

&#62;  Hey Z'onn Z'orr,
&#62;     If you ever want to play on battle-net with a fellow rogue I'm 
&#62; here for ya man. I don,t got a whole lot of net exp., but if you want 
&#62; to get together then mail me  or post something on this forum and 
&#62; we'll get together. I'm a lvl 32 rogue ( legit ).

Greetings, fello rogue in desperation, I here your plea. I have often 
felt as
you do. But a guild is not the answer for everone. Guilds require 
time 
(and patience) . I having little of both am not for them. How ever 
they
can be cool. I would be interested to here your opinion. If you wish 
a 
game could also be arrange (both of use starting at level 1) and we
 could gain experince, and trust together so that one day battlenet
could be free from oppresion, and assholes.

                                                          in humble 
survitude,


                                                          Ria, of
