&#62; First of all, let me define the conditions which define the 
&#62; &#34;best&#34; character.  I'll define, REASONABLY, that the 
&#62; character which has the easiest time on the hardest levels is the 
&#62; BEST character.
&#62; 
&#62; So what is the HARDEST level(s).  Most people, regardless of their 
&#62; preference for character, will say that Hell/Hell, specifically 
&#62; levels 15 and Diablo's Level are the TWO hardest levels in the game.
&#62; 
&#62; So which character finds it easiest to succeed there?
&#62; 
&#62; Well, you can't really include TEAM efforts in this question, 
&#62; otherwise the question would be:  what is the best TEAM combination 
&#62; of characters?
&#62; 
&#62; So, instead, you must assume that the character is playing alone.
&#62; 
&#62; The mage can easily survive on levels 15 and 16.  He just stone 
&#62; curses everything and casts a golem as necessary, even helping the 
&#62; golem to hack away at statues.  This strategy works and is ok, but 
&#62; SLOW!!!
&#62; 
&#62; The warrior, if he can catch the retreating witches, or teleporting 
&#62; advocates can finish them off rapidly.  But he CAN'T CATCH THEM 
&#62; easily!!
&#62; 
&#62; The rogue can nail monsters which AREN'T EVEN ON THE SCREEN, one at a 
&#62; time (not waking them ALL up, which is dangerous for ANY class), 
&#62; without having to retreat for more mana.  Her bow fires so fast that 
&#62; she finishes NON-stone-cursed monsters off as fast as a warrior 
&#62; (assuming he catches them).  Or she can stone curse the monsters and 
&#62; finish them off in ONE-HALF the time that the golem/mage combo can.
&#62; 
&#62; So, the answer is obvious.  The ROGUE is the best character for the 
&#62; game, since she has the easiest time at the hardest levels.
&#62; 
&#62; Artemis II
&#62; Level 40 rogue
&#62; 
&#62; (also Loki - level 38 mage)
&#62; 
&#62; Never played warrior much . . .


This debate has really piqued my curiosity in some respects.  While I 
don't agree with your premise that the best character is the one that 
can do the best on the hardest levels, I'll accept this criteria for 
the purposes of argument.  What I propose is this:  

Each of us clear level 16 on hell difficulty level and time how long 
it takes.  No, this won't solve the question of which class is 
better, but I still think I'll be able to clear it faster with my 
mage than any rogue can.  The more times we test it the better, as 
dungeon configurations will change and figure in the amount of time 
it will take.  The reason I'm using level 16 is because it is the 
only one that always has the same monsters on it, and it already fits 
into your criteria.  Some other ground rules I propose:

Do not worry about clearing inside Diablo's room, but do clear 
everything else (including all around D's room).  
Don't pick up any items or gold.  This is a timed monster-killing 
exercise only.  Trips to town to ID take time.
Do count any trips to town in the amount of time it takes.  Overall, 
I think this is a disadvantage to me, as if I run out of mana, I MUST 
go back up- and I think this must be taken into account.  I have 
always felt that the rogue is the most efficient potion-user, if 
she's not relying on magic.  Of course, any deaths count in the time 
also- so make sure you throw a town portal to get back to 16 if it 
occurs.  (Or, if you want, we could make a death be a 
disqualification-similar to biting off another man's ear.  I'm open 
to discussion on this one.)
No Apoc.  My staff of Apoc only has 36 charges, so it's really not an 
advantage for me to use it, anyway.  However, for the purposes of 
this experiment, I propose that it this spell be excluded.

What do you think?  Obviously, we're on the honor system here- which 
is fine with me.  I'm not doing this to try to prove one class is 
better than the other, I'm just curious to see the results.  One of 
the things I like about the mage is that I can fly through levels.  
I'm interested to see if a rogue really can clear a level faster than 
a mage.  
I do play a legitimate character, and I'm assuming you do too.  If 
you don't, there's no reason to try this experiment.  And again, 
we're on the honor system here.  This is not really a contest, I just 
want to see how it works out.   

Interested?  Any other suggestions or ground rules you think should 
be added?  Or do you think this is just a pointless exercise that 
doesn't merit the time?  (If so, please state why.)  I'll make a run 
tonight and post my results tomorrow- if you're interested in trying 
it.

Thanks for your time,

Aahz</pre>
