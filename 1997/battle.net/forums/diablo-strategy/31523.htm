<pre>This is what happened just about 15 min. ago:

I joined a game created by a mage named Darksnider (yes, D, not P)
It was called Legit no cheaters no pk no lag (or something like that).

Shortly after I joined the game, a rogue and a warrior with plate 
armor came in the game. Let's just say, that I friendly convinced 
them that Godly Plate of the Whale is not legit and that duping is 
cheating... at last they left (why EVER are dupers joining &#34;no 
cheaters&#34; games? The rogue even wanted to dupe her GPOA for me! 
Grrr)

After that, I cleared the 2nd and 3rd level with Darksnider and a 
legit Warrior named Turbo, who then left for some unknown reason. 
When we had most parts of level 3 monster-free, a player with a 
suspicious name entered the game...

Poor_Fellow (Name changed for good reason) was a warrior. He had ca. 
140 Hitpoints and a, for level 9 normal, armor. (And by the way, he 
lagged as hell)
He wanted to go to Cats with us, not a good idea at level 9 I 
thought, so we all went from town to level 3 through Darksniders 
portal.
I was VERY sure he was a PK at that point. And you probably guessed 
it, I was right! Grr... he chopped me down with one hit and 
Darksnider after me, also with one hit.

Surely this was not nice, but I am clever enough not to scream at him 
or flame him. Actually he didn't even hear what I said, because he 
was so proud of his killings. When I and Darksnider restarted in 
town, he said the fallowing things. (And Remember: After killing US, 
a level 9 warrior an a level 10 mage with an obviously hacked weapon):

Mhua ha ha ha ha ha ha! (He had Hot-keyed this, I think)
I killed you little people!
At this pace I soon will be famous!
All I need is dorks as you to spread word about me!
(Thats why I won't tell his real name here ;)
After I said that I would'n, he answered:
If you won't tell anyone about me, you probably just wasted my time!
(Too bad... harharhar)

Shortly after this he left...

Actually he said more stuff like that, everything really clever. But 
since my character &#34;Zeozulu&#34; was MADE to encounter such 
lifeforms, I actually am happy that I met him. This might be a reason 
so many players hate PKs.
I really have nothing against an artistically done P-Kill, but this 
one surely was a disgrace for all PKs on battle.net.

Hmm... who else here has met such poor_fellows? Are they very common? 
I hope not... naah... humanity can't be THAT sick... or, can it?

Tell me what you think! (And excuse the strange stile, it's summer-
holydays, I currently CAN'T care about stile :)
