&#62; First of all I would like to thanks Darksniper for setting up the 
&#62; meeting on BNET sunday. Some of you who were there might have seen me 
&#62; since I was the only person there who played the spawned version(im 
&#62; gonna get the full version soon so dont flame me on that).  Even 
&#62; though i couldnt stay long i still enjoyed it when i was therer.  
&#62; Also to Darksniper.  A couple of pages back u made a post on small 
&#62; useless clans that are out there.  One of the things that make a good 
&#62; clan leader is someone who knows about the game.  You flamed some guy 
&#62; because he didnt know as much as u did about some aspects about 
&#62; diablo. 

i didnt flame him (or at least i didnt think it was a flame), in fact 
i didnt even have a chance to tell him more about the game, cos he 
left before i had a chance to say my 3rd line. anyhow, that was the 
past and i m not gonna start another debate over that =)

 Instead of critizing him did you ever consider telling him 
&#62; about the things he didnt know so he could become a better leader.
&#62; 
&#62; Now to my other point.  I just finished reading Codes survey on what 
&#62; is considerd cheating.  One of the main points was about doing stuff 
&#62; for newbies.  I just want to know exactly what u thing a newbie is.  
&#62; I s a newbie someone who is new to battle.net or just someone who has 
&#62; a new character.  If Azh started over with a new Sorcerer would he be 
&#62; considered a newbie.  I am just curious as to your opinions.

well in my opinion newbies r people new to battle net. however a lot 
of people catagorize both of ur definition as newbie. i wouldnt call 
aahz a newbie if he starts a new mage, now try convincing him to do 
that. i guess he wont anyways, since he lost some of his items last 
nite, he ll have fun hunting again huh? aahz?

anyways, u r welcome for the gathering, i enjoyed it as much as u 
did. so get the game soon. and i ll catch u on bnet!
