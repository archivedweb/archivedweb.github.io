First off I don't play B.net because of the cheaters, I'm quite 
content to play solo multiplayer now that I killed Diablo on single 
player.  

But I can tell you in general that of course most of these players 
couldn't play to save thier life without god mode/hacks/duping/etc.
They haven't developed the skills and strategies needed because they 
haven't really played the game the way it should be played, most of 
them at least.

It's too bad though, cause there's nothing like the thrill of finding 
a Unique or a good magical item and IDing it to see what it is.  
Although last night I have to say I must have gotten a particularly 
bad seed of a dungeon, cause all I got was crap and money.  My 
previous game the day before, every other item that dropped was 
magical or unique.  That's all part of the game though.


&#62; I was in the caves yesterday with my rogue (Royce lvl 18) and there 
&#62; were two other warriors with me.  One of the warriors turned on the 
&#62; other and started hacking.  The guy quickly died.  I asked what was 
&#62; going on (personal vendetta, pk, bounty hunter, etc...) but the guy 
&#62; started coming after me.  I shot him with my arrows and easily dodged 
&#62; his fireballs.  I was in an area with a big rock, so I just circled 
&#62; it, fired at him, and kept dodging his stuff.  Boy, HE SUCKED!!!  All 
&#62; he had to do was put up some firewalls on one side, and come after 
&#62; me, but like an idiot, he just kept chasing me, and once in a while, 
&#62; change directions.  He was so bad, that I had lots of time to 
&#62; ridicule his tactics while fighting him.  I also warned others that 
&#62; joined.  Eventually, he must have had enough and left.  My arrows, by 
&#62; the way, hit him constantly, but his hit points never went down 
&#62; (Surprise, a cheater!)
&#62; 
&#62; My question is this.  Is it your experience that all these cheaters 
&#62; (god mode or otherwise) can't play well.  I've run across a few 
&#62; cheater/pk's  and they usually stink in their play.  It seems, they 
&#62; are only successful when they attack surprise attack.  Are there 
&#62; cheaters out there that consider their ability, above average?  Just 
&#62; wondering.</pre>
