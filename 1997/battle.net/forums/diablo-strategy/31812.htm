&#62; &#62;  I appreciate that you guys gave up a couple of minutes to aswer my 
&#62; question. : )  I have been so frustrated with this problem. I keep 
&#62; trying to compensate for there actions, cause I dont like to shoot 
&#62; the people I'm playing with. It's one of those things that make you 
&#62; look sloppy. As a rogue accurasey ( hmm sp ) is everything. And I 
&#62; hate for people to think I'm shooting them on purpose. I'll try some 
&#62; of the tactics posted here.
&#62; 
&#62;     Again thanks : )

   Violence don't get frustrated with a warrior that  appears to want 
to be a pin cushion.  If you can not help but feel bad or frustrated, 
you may want to warn the warrior that he could get killed if he walks 
into your line of fire (he should already know this though).  I would 
understand if ya told me this and i walked into your line of fire.  I 
would if i died however probably ask if you would mind res me.  I 
would gladly return the favor especially if u die during the game due 
to me (rushing ahead and luring out to many monsters). I play all 
three classes and know how frustrating this can be when playing a 
rogue. I also know that a sorceror can be just as frustrating when 
fighting triple immunes.  I stone curse and let the warriors and 
rogues kill the stoned, but i played with a group of 2 rogues and a 
warrior that would not hit anything that I had stoned! Try to imagine 
a sorceror rushing in the kill a stone cursed soul burner with six or 
seven other burners firing at ya (little difficult!). 
 
  Have fun out there in coop games and give every class a chance in 
order to try to understand some of the strategies or lack of that 
some players use.  That's why i decided to play ech class.  This 
helps me deal better with players that at first I don't understand.
 


Victoor (lvl 31, legit warrior) and the three corrupted
 Jose (lvl 33,warrior), Zen (lvl 29, rogue), Grymwand (lvl 30, sorc)  
 

PS Playing legit is definitely more difficult but i feel is a lot 
more rewarding when you find/earn levels and items.  Thanx 
Darksniper, for the legit clan to join.</pre>
