<pre>The thing that makes acid unique is the fact that there is no 
resistance to it. You can get resistance to fire, magic and 
lightning, but not acid. A group of dogs blasting you with acid balls 
can overwhelm most characters very quickly. So a good strategy for 
avoiding the acid is called for here.

1) Acid has a limited range and the ones with bosses don't usually 
approach. So when they are with bosses, use a distance attack from 
just outside their range. 

2) They prefer to use their claws if you are close enough. If your 
armor class is good enough just close to hand to hand combat with 
them quickly. If there are too many of them for that, just run around 
a corner and take them out as they turn the corner.

3) Their acid does take some time to get to you, how ever short. If 
you must deal with them from a distance within their range, shoot 
then move one space to the side and shoot again. If you keep moving, 
hopefully their acid will go where you were standing, not where you 
are now.

4) You should be able to run faster than them. If you have already 
cleared part of the dungeon, running will help thin them out and you 
might be able to get off some distance attacks from out side their 
range.
