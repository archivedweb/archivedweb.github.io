<pre>There are at least two forms of chatkill/crashkill. One uses a bug in 
your windows program to crash your computer(i think that's the one 
you experienced) and you have to reboot. The microsoft patch should 
fix this. The second one is some kind of long name hack or something. 
Someone hacks a character and gives him a really long name, and when 
he enters a channel, everyone inside gets crashed. This crashes only 
your Diablo program, so you don't have to reboot, just restart 
Diablo. I don't think there's a patch for this yet.

I'm not sure if all this is correct, but after getting crashed about 
10 times in 2 nights, and some discussions with other players, this 
seems to be the consensus. Please post any corrections.

&#62; I've been kicked off the server and unable to access without

&#62; only have 2 you know)  He was very angry that i did not want to duel, 
&#62; and I suspect I was crashkilled(is that the word?)  When I tried 
&#62; reconnecting w/o rebooting, i had the little plug next to my name 
&#62; instead of the lag beads, so I rebooted and got in OK.  I am 
&#62; wondering if anyone has tried the microsoft patch, and how well it 
&#62; works...let me know, any input appreciated.  TIA
