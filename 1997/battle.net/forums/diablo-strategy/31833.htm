<pre>Aahzmadius must a told you last night I was going to post this 
message today. I hope you didn't post your one below in an effort to 
&#34;beat me to the punch&#34;..... doesn't matter.


I'm tired of all the arguments I get into with you. Most of my posts 
seem to gather alot of interest expecially my last survey. I got alot 
of mail from people who enjoyed that (44 replies last time I counted, 
darn near a record). I think alot of people enjoy our little 
&#34;debate&#34; but I think we are going too far.


Anyway I will state my position 1 last time for everyone: I am an old 
timer. I detested cheaters. Cheating started the day diablo came out, 
long before anyone ever &#34;created&#34; a cheat. Anyone remember 
&#34;Modem drop dup&#34;? How about &#34;Portal Dup&#34;? These 
existed from the beginning and people took advantage of them. I hated 
them for it. I was a purist.

As the cheating escalated in later months, the programmer side of me 
(I'm a lead game programmer if anyone doesn't already know) began to 
really get interested in how alot of these simple cheats worked. I 
began to explore their methods and actually talked with their 
creators. I talked to Enigma, Andy Duplain and others. It was 
facinating to me. 

At my work, with Diablo cheating making all the news, I was asked to 
explore how these cheats work and create a model of a game that was 
cheat proof that could be used in future projects.

Somewhere around this time, I began backing up my char due to a 
flakey system. I knew it was cheating but I rationalized that as long 
as I don't restore my char after loosing items to creatures, it's 
really not &#34;cheating&#34; .... yea right *wink wink nudge 
nudge*&#60;g&#62;.

In the world of Tristram, me in my Awsome Plate, I beat Nightmare 
mode solo. I then beat Hell mode solo. Soon after, I became very good 
making solo Hell Hell runs. Although always a challenge, my 
experience was enough I knew when something was impossible and to 
retreat, or when to continue. I learned alot of tricks to stay alive. 
Armor actually became irrelevant in my method of gameplay as I was 
more akin to a mage than warrior. Spells and a Bow are everything.

I began to want something fresh so I began playing the single player 
game. On my first try, I was able to start in the church with a new 
char and work my way slowly, all the way down to Diablo and kill him. 
The quests were really cool so I continued to play, wanting to see 
each and every char. I wanted to learn EVERYTHING about Diablo a fire 
was kindled in me to know all. 

At a rare moment, I found an OZ, at another, GPOW from wirt. I always 
knew QPOW was the armor of choice for dupers and wanted to try it. I 
imported it back over to my Multiplayer char and started 
experimenting. I got a GCOW from wirt and shortly there after a GHOW 
from wirt again. I tried an experiment to see what a 500hp rogue 
would be like. I was very disappointed. But, call me lazy, I still 
kept the GPOW on my multiplayer char and continued playing, having 
fun.

By this time, cheating was in a frenzy and I became very flexible to 
cheats. I never have believed in the hardcore cheats like AutoKill, 
TownKill, GodMode, 256 level Spells, LeachKill and such. I started 
meeting alot of people who had dups to no end and as we played... it 
was still fun, NO I take that back, it was a HELL of a lot of fun. 
They always died several times to my 1 because I had the better 
experience, but it was still enjoyable.

I figured that hey, as long as they aren't trying to PK me, they 
aren't distracting from my fun... in fact, alot of times they added 
to it.

I started digging into the deep roots of Diablo. I have seen the 
hidden movies. I have seen the hidden Art. I have heard the hidden 
WAV files. I have see the hidden creatures. Best of all, I have 
actually PLAYED against the hidden creatures.

Yes, I am a cheater. I don't care who knows it. My love for Diablo is 
very great... being able to use the existing cheats to see these 
marvelous &#34;hidden&#34; things is great. The fact that Raymond 
figured out how to enable the hidden creatures for game play still 
amazes me. I have seen more and done more in Diablo that most people 
ever will. (damn, anyone used that cool Special Effects cheat? Simply 
incredible)
I do not agree that all cheats are &#34;evil&#34; though.

If I were to give advice to anyone starting out in Diablo, I 
definitely would recommend them to play legit. If they do however, 
want to learn more about Diablo or use a *gasp* cheat... well its 
their right. 

DarkSniper, we will never agree on most issues. I find it ironic that 
in 3 areas of my survey that I concider cheating, you do not. But, 
this is a &#34;free&#34; game. I respect your wishes to be legit and 
wish you well. I only ever wanted the same in return.

In the end, I'm going to &#34;bury the hachet&#34; on this. I'm not 
leaving but I do not want to drag out this debate much further. We 
both opened insights on cheating that the others readily enjoyed.

Good luck in Diablo, Good luck with your clan. Cheers.
