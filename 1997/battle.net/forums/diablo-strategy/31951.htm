&#62; Well, I think I just met a thief for the first time on b.net. it 
&#62; happened when I asked someone to help me with transfering items 
&#62; between my chars. I offered him some elixirs. Once we were in a game, 
&#62; there were three of us, the others are &#34;scott&#34; and 
&#62; &#34;zamba&#34;. After giving elixirs, I began to drop items. One of 
&#62; them is a mindcry, then they come around and we had a short 
&#62; conversation. Meantime, the mindcry just disappeared. I asked them if 
&#62; anyone took them, they said none of them took it. Here came a 
&#62; conclusion: COMP ATE IT. Yeah, they told me that and they really 
&#62; thought that I was really stupid enough to believe them. How the hell 
&#62; couldn't I tell the difference between someone took the stuff and the 
&#62; bug. The bug usually happens when we're trying to pick up something 
&#62; while opening the inventory window. Well, I just let it go, don't 
&#62; care much about the mindcry because I don't really need it. I just 
&#62; love collecting unique items I've found, I even keep a fool's crest.
&#62; 
&#62; After all, my point is we can't really trust people even in the 
&#62; virtual world. Or can we???

I have had a similar situation occur only with an Arch-Angel's Staff 
of Apoc.  i was going to dupe it for someone when he picked it up.  i 
asked where it went and he said &#34;let me see if i have it.  nope i 
don't have it.&#34;  i knew he took it so i said &#34;let's go to the 
dungeon&#34;  he agreed and i pk'd him when we got down there using 
my KSOH and Stormshield.  after i killed him he asked why and i told 
him it was because he stole my staff and then he left the game.
