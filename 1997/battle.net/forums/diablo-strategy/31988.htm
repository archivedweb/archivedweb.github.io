&#62; Here are my opinions on cheating, I appreciate feedback on whether or 
&#62; not you people agree, or disagree with my thoughts, so here goes:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 1.)  Using any program that alters your character IS cheating (ex:  
&#62; raising exp, gold, stats, spell levels, or adding items)
&#62; 
I think using almost any program that does anything different from the
original game is cheating. Even the patches that tell you if another 
is cheating
i consider cheating, but i don't really mind the anti-cheat ones. 

&#62; 2.)  Backing up/Restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating, and 
&#62; I am not going to use the old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse.  In 
&#62; single player Diablo, if you get your ass whipped by some demons, all 
&#62; you have to do is restore from your last save, well, there is NO 
&#62; reason that multiplayer should be any different, especially with the 
&#62; added risk of pkillers, and the like.

On a single player game you dont affect other people if you die. You 
can restore
a game and act like it never happened. In a multi-player game, your 
death should
mean more. If monsters kill you, you have to pay the penalty of going 
back to town 
or have a trusted friend to ressurect you. It was made that way. And 
personaly, i don't see 
what the fun of the game would be if you didn't have the risk of 
losing anything. I deffinetly 
think this is cheating.

&#62; 
&#62; 3.)  Transferring characters to/from single player and multiplayer is 
&#62; NOT cheating.  If the character has not been altered by external 
&#62; programs, or hacked in some way, then this transfer is perfectly 
&#62; legitimate, after all, why should someone spend weeks, building up a 
&#62; single player character, just to find out that if they want to play 
&#62; multiplayer, then they will have to start all over from level 1!

This is cheating. it was not meant to be. There are quests where you 
can get 
items in single player that you cannot get  in multi-player.  They 
are two different 
things that cannot fairly be mixed. Its like playing  life and 
monapoly at the same 
time and sharing money. 

&#62; 4.)  In multiplayer games, high-level players, giving things to lower 
&#62; level characters is alright, IF they are normally obtainable by that 
&#62; lower level player, such as a level 20 rouge, giving a level 5 
&#62; warrior a few healing potions, but it should not be takken too far!  
&#62; Such as giving a plate of armor that the lower level character would 
&#62; not have access to for levels to come.  I am sick and tired of seeing 
&#62; extremely low level characters such as levels 1-12 having Godly 
&#62; plates of the Whale, and Obsidian rings of the Zodiac, and Dragon's 
&#62; amulets of the zodiac, and King's swords of haste, these things are 
&#62; EXTREMELY rare and should not be found untill really high levels, I 
&#62; get on B-net all the time, and I always see this, level 1-12 people 
&#62; having better equipment than me (level 16 Warrior), and you know 
&#62; someone just gave it to them.
&#62; 
giving any legit items to any other players is not cheating. it is a 
part of the game.
a level 50 sorceror could give a level 1 warrior an archangels staff 
of apoc and it wouldn't be cheating.

&#62; 5.)  Dupping IS cheating.  If people did not dupe, then the problem 
&#62; in #4 would not exist, if King's swords of haste were as rare as they 
&#62; SHOULD be, NOBODY would be giving them away.
&#62; 
Yes... duping in any circumstances, emergency or not, is always 
cheating.


&#62; 6.)  Also, using a program such as a Trainer, that can grant immunity 
&#62; to other players attacks is NOT cheating (unless dueling of coarse) 
&#62; because of the vast number of dumbshit PKers that are out there, one 
&#62; HAS to protect oneself.
One can protect ones self with a weapon. I thnk pks are totally 
legit. 

they add more fun to the game. if pks weren't supposed to happen, why 
did blizzard make the 
whole ear-thing? Anyway, all you loose is some gold. 


&#62; I appreciate you time and efforts of reading this, and possible 
&#62; posting of a response.  I am in no way shape or form showing 
&#62; disrespect to anyone, or out to offend anyone, so I hope I have not 
&#62; done so.
&#62; 
You can go ahead and cheat all you want. i wont stop you. But if you 
do what you say is ok,
don't call yourself legit, because you are not. I hope you realize 
this and become a good player who 
is in it for fun and adventure. -Waxy
