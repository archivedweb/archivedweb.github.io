<pre>Nice post. Here are my comments.

The curse everything and let your buddies kill it is really boring. 
Really. I have only used this when I got far ahead of my bnet buddy 
in xp and wanted him to catch up. It is good doing this when you are 
showing a newbie the ropes of the game.

The mage in the lead is also problematic for the reasons you state. 
Ridcully advocates this method, but my experience as a warrior 
grouped with mages who do this is that you get diddlysquat for xp.

The best method in my opinion is the last, a division of mobs based 
on immunity and class strengths. This is where 'grouping' has its 
biggest strength. Those snow witches are easy for a mage, but burners 
are a pain in the backside. Within the first few rooms of a level you 
should pretty much know what the offering is and decided then and 
there through chat who takes what. The natural way to run this is for 
the mage to take the fire vulnerables (since they drop like flies to 
his fireball), and rogues and warriors take everything else. The 
mages strongest spell is fireball. For lightning chain is great but 
sucks in groups. Lightning bolt is slow and steady, but other classes 
do better.

So you cruise the level side by side. When a fire vulnerable appears, 
the mage steps to the fore and kills it. When it is fire immune, the 
rogue/warrior takes the lead and the mage curses. In hell/hell mages 
should take the bloodknights, and curse the advocates for their 
buddies.       

The real trick to this method is when a mixed bag of mobs is charging 
you. You have to be able to sort it out without killing each other. 
The secret to this seems to be to have your rogue/warrior buddies 
wait/dodge and you teleport about taking out your chosen mobs. For 
instance if you have a room of snow witches and bloodknights, 
teleport in and fireball the witches, then teleport back out behind 
your rogue and warrior buddies. I guess this is more like a 
combination of methods 2 (sorc in lead) and 3 (sort by vuln).

Hallways are sticky. Again teleport seems to be the answer, with 
mages porting down the hall to see whats ahead. Here having your 
rogue/warrior buddies lay in wait behind a corner and you luring them 
out is a tactic worth trying.

The Rogue must restrain herself from firing into a room where a mage 
is selectively pruning. A few stray arrows and your mage is tagged 
and goes down to a throng of fire immunes. The rogue should turn a 
corner and fire in such a manner that no arrows go into the room 
until the mage is out.

For Mage/Rogue/Warrior the mob split is difficult as the Rogue and 
warrior must decide who gets what of the leftover mobs. The natural 
division for rogues and warriors is the rogue taking ranged mobs with 
the warrior taking melee mobs. 

Some general divisions:

Mage                  Rogue                       Warrior
----------           -------                      -------
Witches              Witches                      Knights
Stormriders          Hidden                       Drakes
Wizards              Spitters                     Skeletons
Goatmen              Goatmen                      Zombies
Dark Ones            Dark Ones                    Chargers
Fire Vuln            Triple Immunes               Triple Immunes

Within each of these mob classes there are some that are easier and 
some which are harder for any given class to take.
