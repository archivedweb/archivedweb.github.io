&#62; &#62; Eaglehorn is an excellent bow.  I use it most often, even in 
&#62; &#62; Nightmare /Hell and Hell/Hell.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I also have Windforce, which is also excellent, partly because it 
&#62; &#62; just does more damage than Eaglehorn and it knocks-back monsters.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I just finished Hell/Hell the other night.  I used Windforce most of 
&#62; &#62; the time, and it's knock-back feature allowed me to stay alive when 
&#62; &#62; fighting the Steel Lords on 16.  If I was using the Eaglehorn, I 
&#62; &#62; would have died.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; However, I died once when fighting Diablo, because he would get 
&#62; &#62; knocked back and then hit me again with apocalypse.  So, after I 
&#62; &#62; restarted in town, I switched to the Eaglehorn and went back down 
&#62; &#62; after Diablo.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; The Eaglehorn worked great!!  I was able to hit Diablo repeatedly 
&#62; &#62; without him even getting a chance to hit me back once.  He just 
&#62; &#62; stayed in one spot as arrow after arrow sank home, quivering with 
&#62; &#62; each hit.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I then developed a new respect for my Eaglehorn--it may not do the 
&#62; &#62; damage of some bows, but the monsters can't hit you if you're hitting 
&#62; &#62; them, and the Eaglehorn does the job, even if you have to fire a few 
&#62; &#62; more arrows than the Windforce.  
&#62; 
&#62; Personally, I like to use my Merciless Bow of the Heavens.  The best
&#62; bow of Diablo varies: ask 100 Rouges and get 100 very different 
&#62; answers.  I'd say that you should find a bow (or two) that you like
&#62; and that keep the monsters off of you (either by knockback or by
&#62; killing them first) and use it/them, no matter what they are, as long 
&#62; as you like and are happy with it/them.

   I agree with the previous reply. Rogues I believe benifit the most 
from raising all your attributes.  Both strength and dexterity raise 
damage for your bow,the higher strength will help you wear heavier 
plates and the magic will give you more mana. I think wearing items 
that boost alot of mana are just as important as a good bow. I'm a 
legit level 34 rogue and kill most everything with magic. Also mana 
shield reduces alot of damage monsters do.(up to 21&#37;). Thats why 
wizards die so fast when they lose mana shield. I got my chain and 
fireball up to level 8 by holding magic enhancing items and went even 
higher by using enchanted shrines. Your chances of finding a merc bow 
of the heavens is probably rarer than finding windforce though.
