&#62; POP QUIZ:  Are you a Gamer, a Player or a Nerd?
Cool.  A diversion.

&#62; Question #1: How many hours a week do you spend playing Diablo?
&#62; A)  0-6
&#62; B)  7-14
&#62; C)  15+

A.  I wish it was C though.

&#62; Question #2: Your real life personality and that of your Diablo 
&#62; persona are
&#62; A)  Incomparable.  I dont have an identifiable persona
&#62; B)  Similar.  My ethical and moral values generally tend to be the 
&#62; same, aside from an occasional pkill J
&#62; C)  Blurred beyond salvation.  I regularly confuse the two.  I catch 
&#62; myself trying to fireball people that drive real slow in the fast 
&#62; lane.

B.

&#62; Question #3: Your favorite character is
&#62; A)  I dont have one, I like and play them all
&#62; B)  I have one class I like the best, but Ive experimented with them 
&#62; all
&#62; C)  I absolutely LOVE that character I created when I first bought 
&#62; the game in January!  Once, I had a hard drive crash and I went into 
&#62; a coma.  My mom had to send the drive off to a data recovery company 
&#62; to wake me from my sleep.

B.

&#62; Question #4:  Describe your typical Battle.Net time.
&#62; A)  I just roam in and out of the public games until I find some cool 
&#62; people to play with
&#62; B)  I roam the public channels and a couple of guild ones.  I chat a 
&#62; bit and play a bit.
&#62; C)  I go to a private guild channel and stay there.  All night.  All 
&#62; day.  Im always there.  Everyone knows me.  I survive on Tic-Tacs 
&#62; and Mountain Dew.

B

&#62; Question #5:  Are you involved in any Diablo communities?
&#62; A)  Nah, I dont have the time.  Besides, the pubs are fine with me.
&#62; B)  Im in a guild.  Its a cool break from all the cheaters in the 
&#62; public games.  Ive met some cool people that I adventure with semi-
&#62; regularly
&#62; C)  I founded a clan.  You better not say a damn thing about us 
&#62; either.  If you do, well circle the wagons and hire bounty hunters 
&#62; to track you down and bring us your ear.  Thats if we dont get it 
&#62; first.  So just shut up!  Were the best there is and thats that!  No 
&#62; one is gonna defile my clan and get away with it!

B.

&#62; Question #6: Do you read or post on any Diablo related forums?
&#62; A)  I mostly just read.  I post questions on occasion, but for the 
&#62; most part Im a lurker
&#62; B)  I read and post on a semi-regular basis.  I have a nickname that 
&#62; some/most people recognize.
&#62; C)  I read and post every damn day.  In fact, I go through 
&#62; withdrawals if I cant post for more than 3 days at a time.  In a 
&#62; perfect world, I wouldnt have to sleep and I could post my limit 
&#62; 24/7.

B.

&#62; Question #7: How do you feel about cheaters?
&#62; A)  To each his own.  They paid the same for the game as I did.
&#62; B)  Cheaters have ruined the public games for me.  Thats a main 
&#62; reason I joined a guild
&#62; C)  Cheaters are scum!  I hope they all burn in hell!  Die! Die! Die!

Between A and B

&#62; Question #8: What other sorts of games do you like?
&#62; A)  I like the big ones.  You know, Quake, Red Alert, Warcraft 2, etc
&#62; B)  I have a diverse collection.  Some of the big ones and a few of 
&#62; the lesser known titles.  I still play them all
&#62; C)  What the hell kind of question is that?!  There is no other game 
&#62; that has ever been produced that is as cool as Diablo. You should go 
&#62; to hell with the cheaters for speaking such heresy!

D. None of the above.  I've never played the games you mentioned, but 
have played a few (eye of the beholder, might and magic, myst)

&#62; Question #9:  What game are you most looking forward to?
&#62; A)  None really, I dont pay attention to games in development, I get 
&#62; most of my games at Christmas and birthdays, so I take what I get.
&#62; B)  Starcraft is looking pretty good.  I thought Id like the 
&#62; Hellfire expansion pack for Diablo, but without multiplayer support, 
&#62; I wont buy it.
&#62; C)  Hellfire and Diablo 2.  End of discussion!

A.  I've never bought a computer game for myself in my life.  I got 
Diablo for my birthday, and the EOTB, M&M games were **cough** lent 
**cough** to me by some friends.  Myst is my wife's game.

&#62; Ok times up.  Lets see how you did.

Be like Woody, I wanna be like Woody.  Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, I 
wanna be... Be like Woody, I wanna be like Woody.  Do you have your 
own brand of shoes?

By the way, a question.
There is some speculation that if you have no, or bad equipment when 
you enter a game, you will likely find better items.  Part of the 
seeding theory.  Since you play with CURSED items, do you find that 
you find more KSOV, OROZ, APOS, KSOH, etc...?</pre>
