<pre>&#62; mage weapon, windforce/eaglehorn are two OF (not the two best) the 
&#62; best bows.  Now, being an experienced (don't even test me) Laz 
&#62; Runner, I have found ALMOST every unique in the game.  Noticeably, 
&#62; off hand, the biggest I have yet to find is Eaglehorn.
&#62; 
&#62; Q.  What uniques do you think are the best for each character and are 
&#62; there (In your opinion) any &#34;non uniques&#34; better than those 
&#62; uniques?
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, I guess this is the direction I would like this post to go in:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  State (what you believe) is the best item for THE CHARACTER THAT 
&#62; YOU ARE MOST EXPERIENCED IN for every weapon slot (read my answer for 
&#62; guidance) (i.e..dreamflange/mage, blah blah..etc. etc.)
&#62; 
ok, rogue/weapon  the best unique bow is windforce, and it is 
argueably the best bow, although I have never had one, I understand 
the &#34;of the bear&#34; concept, and like it alot :) However, the 
best bow i ever used was a merciless bow of thunder, and I am 
currently using a vicious bow (4-8 +77&#37; damage) with my current 
charachter.

rogue/helm  gotta be the royal circlet, no ifs ands or butts, rc kicks

rogue/armor hmmmm, tough one, naj's is a little lite on the ac, 
although the specials are real nice, and demonspike isn't all that 
awesome, the three best plates i have used were my obsidian plate of 
the wolf, the awesome plate of the ages, and my saintly plate. 

rogue/jewelry  well, barring the obvious obs/jade of zod/heavens, my 
favorites for the rogue are gold and perfection, I have yet to find a 
good unique ring, and i think I have found them all. My current 
kenwar has a ring of regha(sp?) and a constricting ring, and my 
previous kenwar had the bleeder, and a multitude of rings of 
engagement.

rogue/shield  I ain't even gonna go there
