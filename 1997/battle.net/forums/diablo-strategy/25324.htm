<pre>OK, the popularity of Diablo has dimished since January, but name a 
better game out right now?  Maybe it's you?  I have too played since 
day one (Jan. 3rd), about 4-5 times a week, and have yet to lose 
interest! 

&#62; For anyone with any sense would be able to see that Diablo is slowly 
&#62; dying. 

Where do you get this crap from?  You don't have any sense my dear 
friend?  Name anything in life that doesn't slowly die??  Got any?  
Doubt it!!  Oh, a rock!!

&#62; Every time you play its the same thing, same weapons, same 
&#62; items, same etc. 

Are you just making this up as you go?  I have yet to have the same 
items since day one, I keep getting better items or I started a new 
character.  Have you tried multi player?  And had a challenging game?

&#62; People are either using cheat files to make new 
&#62; stuff, using cheat files to kill others, or they just stop playing 
&#62; all together. 

Yeah, the 12 year olds!! 

&#62; Pretty soon Blizzard is going to put Diablo to sleep 
&#62; until Diablo 2 comes out. For those who don't think there will be a 
&#62; second one should just think. Blizzard sold over 500,000 copies of 
&#62; Diablo. Blizzard would be stupid if they didn't make a sequal.

Last time I looked Starcraft is right around the corner!  And then 
the new Warcraft game.  I would have to believe no company puts out a 
sequel within a year of realeasing the original.  Give them a good 
year or year and a half, to release a new Diablo.  Look at Warcraft, 
Warcraft 2 came out over a year later.

Patience is a virtue my friend.  Realize a great game and applaud it!!
Of all the crap that is out there, Blizzard brings most of us joy 
with there titles (not to sure on the new Warcraft!?!).

So, go back to your Nintendo-Nofriendo, and you will realize how 
great Diablo truely is!
