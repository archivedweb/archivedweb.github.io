<pre>I don't think that there are many shades at all.  It is really black 
or white simple as that.  The thing is that hacking isn't cheating 
nessiceraly.  Let me give an example.  
If there is a game clearly listed new10orlessnopks and some jerk 
decided to come in with with a level 25 mage and kill them all.  
Whether that mage is legit or not, non hacked in any way or not, no 
duped items ever used or put into his inventory it's cheating.  He's 
clearly violated that hosts right of hosting a game for charictures 
that are 

1. At level 10 or less.  
2. No pking.  

Duping is cheating when you use it to gain levels faster, or to steal 
a better object of some sort.  It means you didn't earn whatever you 
are using and getting a free ride.

Hacks are altering game code.  Duping is an example of a bug in the 
game and there are probably more things that I don't know of because 
I don't want to know about hacking or taking advantage of flaws in 
the program.  I play without cheating in any way.  I don't consider 
backing up anything wwrong because I lost a good charicture to a 
crash before.  I simply restored and went on my way.  If you use it 
to dupe then that would be another form of hacking.

Also if someone a higher level than you are gives you soemthing and 
he never hacked or used a game flaw in any way, if the item is legit 
than that isn't cheating.  Blizzerd made the game that way.  It's up 
to you if you want to use the item or not and if it makes the game to 
easy for you then it is only your fault.  

Bottom line, hacking and cheating are two diffrent things.  I 
consider myself to be legit.  I consider pking to be cheating if the 
game says it's not aloud.  Also I think the host, whoever creats the 
game has control.  The hosts rule is law.  If a game says no pking 
then don't.  If the host of the game, (Normaly the only one there or 
whoever claims they are.) says not to pk then don't.  If they don't 
want any hacks or dupes then don't use them.  If you want to use them 
go to another game.  I normaly only play on bnet with people i can 
trust.  Only peopel that I can trust.  

When I first started on bnet I didn't know much and when my 
characture was only at level three someone pk'ed me about five times 
in just one game.  Took what meager things I had at that time.  Which 
weren't very good at the time.  I kept getting pkilled untill I 
stoped playing in open games long.  I dout I ever will again.  I 
consider pking cheating when people come into games and simply start 
killing people and don't stop when they are asked.

So in conclusion, I only see two groups.  Cheaters, and the 
noncheaters.  I am a non cheater and if you consider legit only 
playing the game the way blizzerd intended, no duping hacking and 
basicly only using totaly legit stuff.  (I use a sword I got from 
someone that I can trust.)  Then I am legit.  I will never cheat and 
I work for what I have.
