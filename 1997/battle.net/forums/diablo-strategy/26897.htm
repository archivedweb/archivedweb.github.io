&#62; 
&#62; Diablo does not always drop items.  In fact, I don't know if I've 
&#62; ever seen him do it.  However, the only thing that you can do, is to 
&#62; have some one be in the game, but not in level 16 when you kill 
&#62; Diablo.  (of course, this only works in multi games).  Then, after 
&#62; that movie is over, go back into the game and go to level 16.  WATCH 
&#62; OUT!!!  Even though you killed Diablo, there may be another Diablo 
&#62; there waiting for you.  Once, three guys killed Diablo and left the 
&#62; game.  After playing for about 10 minutes, and deciding that they 
&#62; weren't returing, I went to level 16, to see if anything was left 
&#62; behind.  After taking two steps in level 16, Diablo was running after 
&#62; me.  I thought this was a bug.  But later, in a different game, two 
&#62; other people and I killed Lazarus, and a minute later someone joined 
&#62; the game, took our portal, and came down to Lazarus' chamber.  Even 
&#62; though the room was empty to the three of us, the fourth person died, 
&#62; and swore that she could see Lazarus.  We ressurected her, and she 
&#62; ran out of the room, but she came back in the room, and appeared to 
&#62; be fighting someone, and we could see her hit points go down 
&#62; periodically.  Weird.  She continued to swear that Lazarus was still 
&#62; alive to her.  Maybe it's a bug.

I think it is possible that the programs (the game running on the 
PCs) somehow get out of sync.

One time, I was playing with two friends. After fighting a group of
monsters, things got wield. I was able to see both my friends (their
character and their messages), they were able to see me (and my
messages), but they could not see each other (character or messages).
One of my friend swore he saw the other die in the fight.

So I told them to quit the game and join again. They could not join
the game, but was able to create another game using the same name and
password. So I had to quit the game and join the one they created.</pre>
