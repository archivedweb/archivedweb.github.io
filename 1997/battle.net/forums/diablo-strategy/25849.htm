&#62; Yah, I killed my beloved character, then resurrected her at level 1.  
&#62; I'm starting from scratch, and I will be 100&#37; legit all the way.  
&#62; 
&#62; Partly, I did it because I want to see if I can increase my spell 
&#62; levels by replaying the game again, this time focusing on looking for 
&#62; and buying books (and ignoring crap spells that I never use).
&#62; 
&#62; BUT, most importantly, I had reached level 36, and the game just 
&#62; wasn't as much fun anymore.  I killed Diablo on Hell/Hell; Normal 
&#62; Hell was a breeze, and the stuff I found wasn't as good as the stuff 
&#62; I already had.
&#62; 
&#62; So I deleted my character and restarted in a multiplayer game by 
&#62; myself.  It was great!!  I was actually scared of the skeletons in 
&#62; the church and was amazed how hard it was to kill everything and stay 
&#62; alive at the same time.
&#62; 
&#62; I cleaned out the first two levels by myself--including the Butcher!! 
&#62; (he killed me once, but then I trapped him in the stairwell down and 
&#62; let fly till he croaked).  :-)
&#62; 
&#62; It was the most fun I've had in a long time.  I realize now that the 
&#62; fun and the excitement were derived from risk, opportunity and 
&#62; possibility, not in being secure and complete.  I can't wait to do my 
&#62; 20-30 levels all over again!!
&#62; 
&#62; Some may think I'm crazy, but it made Diablo exciting for me all over 
&#62; again.  I highly recommend it!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 

Good for you. That's is how I do it everytime. And I dont cheat too.
It makes the game challenging and fun.</pre>
