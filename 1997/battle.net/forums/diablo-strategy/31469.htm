<pre>On Mon Jul 14 11:48, DarkSniper (my views on cheatings) wrote:
&#62; ok correct me if i m wrong, the main point to ur post is &#34; MK or 
&#62; Cheating&#34;. the stealing thing is not valid cos people still do it 
&#62; now.

The point of my post was to make people take a second and think about 
Diablo and the state it's in. I am also not trying to justify people 
cheating or not cheating.

&#62; well, i dont see anything wrong with pk nor mk. (i dont do it but i 
&#62; see nothing wrong with it.) my philosophy is that, if i can killed by 
&#62; a legit pk, i ll just say i was not smart enough or i was not strong 
&#62; enough. mk can be avoided a lot of times if u r an experienced 
&#62; player. thats what the restart in town button is for. once u die, do 
&#62; not hesitate. and if u do, thats ur problem. 

I absolutely disagree. If &#34;cheating&#34; is unethical then why so 
is &#34;killing&#34; someone and stealing their stuff? Just because 
Blizz gave the option to enable Player Attack everyone seems to think 
this makes everthing ok? 

I think by your post you are assuming &#34;MK&#34; to refer to 
someone PK'ing you, gathering a monster near then Rez'ing you. I mean 
by Mkill that someone &#34;helps&#34; you die by firing at you with 
arrows or whatever when you are surrounded by creatures. You die and 
spill everything on the ground (which makes restarting irrelevant).
 
&#62; i see pk this way, in real life (since this is a rpg) people back 
&#62; stab u all the time. u cant do anything about it. let say this guy is 
&#62; trying to rip u off for this item u just bought, u cant just 
&#62; duplicate it. if someone rob ur house, u lose ur stuff, as simple as 
&#62; that.

Wrong. In real life we have laws, police and a court system to handle 
people who do things the majority of the populace has determined to 
be &#34;bad&#34;. There are consequences for their actions. In 
Diablo, there aren't any consquences so people justify their 
PK'ing/cheating/stealing as &#34;hey, it's just a game&#34;. It 
really bothers me that people think ruining others fun of playing 
Diablo by PK'ing them is less important that cheating. If someone is 
cheating, then they may be missing out on some of the fun of diablo, 
but when they get &#34;murdered&#34; by another player while only 
trying to play the game, they do NOT think this is fun. Yet all the 
&#34;legits&#34; out there proclaim that this is OK because it's part 
of the game. I will never understand this point of view.
 
&#62; u also forgot a few things. without cheats there will be less pks. 
&#62; over half of the pk i know, pks cos they r bored of the game. and 
&#62; why? cos they cheated. its true some pks just like to kill players 
&#62; but u can always avoid them in private games. and if u do go to a 
&#62; public game, u ll have to take that chance. i think that chance adds 
&#62; to the suspense of the game, after all, u have to look behind ur back 
&#62; all the time.

Hmmmmm &#34;without cheats there will be less pks&#34; How do you 
arrive at this conclusion? People PK because of 3 reasons I can think 
of. #1). They are bored with Diablo, #2). They are truely &#34;pissed 
off&#34; at someone for some reason and kill a specific target, #3) 
because they wish to ruin others fun (as stated by alot of PK's in 
Tavern and other clan's (Inferno)). I personally was PK'ed more in 
the first few weeks of Diablo than in all the months since. Maybe 
others have had different views of this but this is my personal 
experience (I have been playing ALOT of public games lately... out of 
the last 8, there has only been 1 PK).

Anyway you missed the point. Again, without cheats, public games are 
still dangerous and people would still result to private games.

&#62; as for heavens item being everywhere... thats great! that makes 
&#62; zodiac rings more wanted and rare. without cheats, the trading will 
&#62; be great! go to the trading post channel now, and see what they trade 
&#62; there. df rings, demonspike coat rings... all hacks. but imagine 
&#62; without cheats. all legit items. and people will appreciate the items 
&#62; given to them more, cos its the original thing, not just a duped 
&#62; version.

Trading would be cool.... but it would have the added danger of 
&#34;Stealing&#34; which was rampant early in Diablo but has died off 
now with the &#34;availibility&#34; of  items.
 
&#62; one more point. duels. imagine dueling without cheats. without level 
&#62; 25 fireballs. without gods mode characters. woooo, that sound great.

I never have dueled... maybe I'm missing something here but I am 
proud to say &#34;I never have dueled or PK'd&#34;.
 
&#62; ok one more... channel problems. look at all the level 40+ or even 
&#62; 50+ characters r in a channel. this makes me sick! seeing my hard 
&#62; worked level 38 rogue there and all these level 40 cheaters in the 
&#62; room. and if u r a legit level 40+ character, i feel sorry for u, cos 
&#62; i dont think too many players will believe that u r legit, and i m 
&#62; getting there soon.

I agree with this.... it annoyes me horribly to know I have worked 
for the past 6 months to get my char to level 46 and to see newbies 
running around at level 40+. (I hit 703 million exp last night.... 21 
mill left to level 47! Then &#60;ick&#62; only 600 mill to level 50).
 
&#62;  do u ever hear what the topics r in public channels? they r pure 
&#62; stupid topics unrelated to diablo. i m not saying we should only chat 
&#62; about diablo in a channel but some topics just make me wanna... 
&#62; whatever. u might ask, so what does this have to do with cheating? 
&#62; well, if people r still interested in the game, then they would talk 
&#62; more about diablo instead of these topics u hear when u dial 1 900 
&#62; numbers. well they would still exist but not as much. cos those 
&#62; players just like to chat. they dont play games.

I don't see anything wrong with occasional &#34;shooting the 
breeze&#34; with people. I have made some DAMN good friends in chat. 
Friends I hope to never loose track of.
 
&#62; damn, another one just poped up. clans. without cheats clan will be 
&#62; even better. imagine a war between a nonpk clan(sort of ironic)  VS a 
&#62; pk clan? damn that would be fun. but now? i dont even know how to 
&#62; kill a cheater. we have to aviod them by using private games and 
&#62; channels. now that really sux!

Hmmmmm a bunch of players who only want to play Diablo getting killed 
by people who only want to kill them, yea, sounds fun. 
 
&#62; my conclusion is, i dont see anything good about cheating. btw, since 
&#62; everyone seems to have a different definition for cheating, this is 
&#62; mine. &#34; not playing the game the way it was suppose to be played 
&#62; by blizzard.&#34; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; DarkSniper


We will never see eye to eye on this. You have alot of followers in 
your &#34;crusade&#34;. As long as they are having fun then great, I 
wish them well. But if someone wants to use a Dup, I feel it's their 
RIGHT to do so.... and not bitch them out for it. They have 
absolutely as much right to load up their char with dups as you have 
to not. You try to belittle them because they do not play as you do.

To everyone I say, heck, you paid your $$$ for the game, have FUN!!!! 
If you want to try to beat it without cheats (which I do recommend 
btw) then great I say! If you need a little help then again I say 
fine, it's your decision and I'm not gunna put you on a guilt trip 
for it. 

To Boots, earlier you made a point in your game with the high HP 
cheater... my recommendation is to just tell him to stop it or drop 
down a level when he's not looking. However, it is annoying. What 
would you do if a legit high level Mage started doing the same thing?

In the end, I'm not trying to justify cheats or dups... it wasn't my 
intent. I hoped to just show that it was *POSSIBLE* that if all 
legits had their way and &#34;cheats never existed&#34;, the world 
would not necessarilly be a better place (this is due to Diablo 
pushing the envelope into an area that has never been attempted 
before, thanks Blizz!).
