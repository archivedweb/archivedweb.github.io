<blockquote>
<pre>I was very surprised of the counts calling backup not cheating. It is 
an external program. Some claim its a conveinance over manual file 
copying. The thing which drives me to call this a cheat is the 
temptation to use a backup restore is always there as long as there 
is a backup. I would venture that many people using this only for 
'system crash backups' use it also for pkill backups and for other 
intractable situations which they equate to system crashes. *CHEATING 
IN RESPONSE OT CHEATING IS CHEATING*. If you play a roguelike game 
like ADOM, backing up your save files is clearly cheating, as the 
game intentionally deletes your file during play. Diablo is not ADOM 
but it does have a roguelike heritage. I have yet to have a system 
crash kill/erase any of my characters, and I have a lot of hours in. 
It seems to me if you have frequent system crashing problems that 
warrant the use of backups, the proper course of action is to resolve 
the system crashing problem. I had a RAM mismatch problem which was 
crashing the hell out of me with invalid page faults, which I 
resolved by removing the incompatable RAM banks.

I was also surprised at how close the counts were on Deye. Come on- 
it clearly is a 3rd party program designed to impart information on 
other players meant to be private.

About this shopping=cheat view-
Bliz set up these long annoying walks to balance shopping. It is my 
experience that at some point shopping becomes counter productive, 
which is a natural check on its abuse. You can spend hours shopping 
and not find anything of value. I think you build up power much more 
rapidly in a 'non purist' fashion by either shrine surfing or doing 
Laz runs.

It appears that everyone has their own view on cheating. Many people 
do not have a consistant view on cheating. Anyone can create a whole 
big long laundry list of 'easy' tactics which some might frown upon 
and call cheating. By defining cheating in this subjective manner, 
you are heading for an inconsistant view on cheating.

The only objective view of cheating is that any 3rd party program is 
cheating. Abuse of bugs is a gray area, but in general I would lump 
abuse of bugs in with cheating since bugs were not intended to be in 
the game. Anything else is legit play.

Nice discussion Code Myster, Zamp and others.
