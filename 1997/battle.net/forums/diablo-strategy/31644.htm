&#62; I want to clarify a few things here.
&#62; 
&#62;         First of all, it's 5 in the morning, I'm tired, but so 
&#62; annoyed at a trend I see developing here that I have to speak out! 
&#62; Cheating in any of it's forms is not acceptable to me, and that is 
&#62; why I only play in my guild.
&#62; 
&#62;         Cheating is defined, in my book, as doing anything that is 
&#62; not an INTENTIONAL part of the game. This means abviously that all 
&#62; hacks and trainers are cheating, as well as duping, because although 
&#62; it can be done within the game without the use of an external 
&#62; program, it wasn't placed there intentionally.
&#62; 
&#62;         Two things I don't see as cheating that I have seen listed 
&#62; here as cheating are, backing charachters up, and trading. First of 
&#62; all, I have seen this said a number of times, and I agree, Blizzard 
&#62; did not intend for system crashes and hd crashes to be a part of the 
&#62; game. I haven't actually used a backup program successfully yet (not 
&#62; for lack of trying) so i'm innocent whether it is cheating or not, 
&#62; but I do not think it is cheating. Second of all, I play in a legit 
&#62; league, with other legit players, then trading is not cheating, it is 
&#62; a way of life. If i find a dreamflange with my rogue, and my buddy 
&#62; the mage finds a windforce, you can believe we'll trade! But then, I 
&#62; have no fear that the item I am accepting is legit, because I know 
&#62; the people I trade with, and play with them frequently.
&#62; 
&#62;        Yes, I realize I am seeing black and white here, but that is 
&#62; the way I see the issue. You either cheat or you do not cheat, there 
&#62; is no middle ground, And I personally do not play with charachters 
&#62; that are cheated in any way.
&#62; 
&#62;        Now I realize that Darksniper is going to disagree with me on 
&#62; this one, but I also believe that recieving items from players well 
&#62; over your charachters level is another form of cheating, and is 
&#62; almost as bad as the rampant duping out there. In my guild we follow 
&#62; a 3 level trading rule, because otherwise the characther at the other 
&#62; end of the trade may be getting an item that is totally out of 
&#62; possibility for a charachter of his level to obtain legitimately. 
&#62; When the items a charachter is using far outclass the charachter, 
&#62; then the player is playing the item, not the charachter, and that is 
&#62; not the way the game was meant to be played.
&#62; 
&#62;       All you cheaters out there who are thinking, hey, it's my 50 
&#62; bucks, I'll play the way I want to play, YES, it is your 50 bucks, 
&#62; and I am not going to tell you you can't use your cheat programs, but 
&#62; don't use them with me. I believe that diablo is a game that just 
&#62; can't get boring, so I don't accept that excuse, the other one I 
&#62; despise is that the person can't win without them. That is bull, they 
&#62; just need a few more hours of practice, and they'll be able to handle 
&#62; the situation with little or no problem, and beyond that, Diablo is 
&#62; meant to be a challenge! if there was no challenge, there would be no 
&#62; fun! To me, these are the same kind of people who said,&#34; I'll 
&#62; never use physics in my real life, if they're going to force me to 
&#62; take it, then why shouldn't I cheat?&#34; only in this case it is 
&#62; worse, because no one is forcing you to play diablo. And to the final 
&#62; class of cheater out there, the cheater who cheats just to annoy 
&#62; people, I have little to say about this group of people except that 
&#62; they are a$$h@le's who deserve to be drug out into the street and 
&#62; shot for ruining the game that I spent my hard earned money on. I 
&#62; bought this game, and I should be free to enjoy it, and this class of 
&#62; cheater ruins my fun!@#^&@
&#62; 
&#62;         Let me summarize by saying that I will never be reconciled 
&#62; with the cheaters of the diablo world, and that if I could get rid of 
&#62; all the hack and cheat programs out there, I would!
&#62; 
&#62;         
&#62; 
&#62; time for a quick plug, If you agree with me, then the guild I am in 
&#62; may be for you, check us out, <a href="http://www.aodh.com/">http://www.aodh.com/</a> . We're always 
&#62; looking for a few good legit players.
