<pre>first off, great post, and a lot of good ideas. 

well, as an extremist, i dont think we ll ever be in the same boat 
about this issue. ur a person who would let the world corrupt and 
just sit there and do nothing. (pls dont get me wrong, cos sometimes 
doing nothing is better than making the situation worse.)

lemme put it this way, lets use drug (for lack of a better item) as 
an example. let say if everyone start to use it, u would just let it 
be. u ll be clean cos u dont use it. but u wont stop others from 
using it, cos its their life, and if it makes them happy, then so be 
it. on the other hand, i dont like to sit and wait. i go out and stop 
them. not just my friends, but everyone. i know i cant stop the whole 
mess, but by the end of the day, i can say to myself, u ve done ur 
best. maybe i stoped a few kids from using drugs. its not a lot if u 
compare to how many thats screwed up already, but at least i tried. u 
might think this example is too extreme, but when u think about it, 
its quite similar. drug kills someone, cheating ruins the game for 
someone and there for they quit. well, of course there r people who 
survive from using drugs, and there r people who survive from using 
cheats. but what do they become? a pk? or a player who just chat in 
the channel and refuse to play cos the game is too boring. 

i said it before and i ll state it again... my definition of legit 
(not nescessarily true but in my opinion).  play the game the way it 
was meant to be played by blizzard. as for  ur point about using 
hacks to restore characters, i dont think its a cheat. because 
blizzard never intend to make a system crash in the game. therefore 
in my opinion i think using a back up , or do what i do just put the 
saved file in another folder, is not cheating. blizzard supported me 
with this method as PatN told me himself. therefore i dont consider 
it cheating. now try asking him how to dupe, i dont think he ll tell 
u.

now this is why i look down on cheaters. (the cheating character not 
the person themselves). they claim to have all these nice stuff when 
it is only duped, while i work for mine. again think of it this way. 
when u were in high school (long time ago for me), when a student has 
100&#37; on a test, but he cheated. and i have 95 only, and i worked 
my ass off  for this. this cheater goes around telling everyone how 
he or she is so smart... what would u do? if u follow the philosophy 
u use in diablo, then i think u would just let it go. but im 
different, i would say something, or tell everyone that he cheated to 
get this mark. 

cheaters r lower than legit because their items r either duped or 
hacked. now why is that u might ask. because anyone can do the same. 
anyone can go to the trading channel and say i need a df ring 
demonspike coat ring, a gpow... and then they will have a super 
character. now that wasnt too hard was it? but what does legit do to 
get these great items? they go down hell 100 times... or more to get 
what they want. how often do u hear a cheater sayiing, hey im gonna 
hunt for an awesome plate. why hunt when u have a gpow? i think if 
something is avalible for anyone or easily achieved is not as 
valuible as something that u worked hard for.

ur correct for say i should let them play the way they want to. and i 
do if they dont affect me. if they cheat in a single game, i wouldnt 
give a damn. however they r corrupting bnet. and i m playing in bnet, 
therefore i try to stop them.

yes u can always say who m i to say whats wrong or was rite. but then 
again who makes  the law in the real world? who r they to say whats 
wrong or whats rite? can i go out and steal something and then say, 
but this is the way that makes me happy. hell no. this is not how it 
works.

i know i used a lot of real world example in this post. i use it 
because this is a rpg. u try to live or rule play urself in this 
fantasy world. i know what a lot of u r thinking. this is a GAME... 
well, yeah this is a game and this is the legit character i try to 
play.

what fun is there when u can have unlimited money playing monopoly? u 
ll never die and the game just continues forever. so why play such a 
stupid game?

well my conclusion is... i m too tired to write one, so i ll just 
leave it like that, but if u follow my posts, im sure u pretty much 
know what im gonna say.

p.s. lorax, i do know how to use the shift key, i just dont bother 
using it and i know how to spell YOU, ARE... so pls forgive me for my 
lack of ability. thx ;)</pre>
