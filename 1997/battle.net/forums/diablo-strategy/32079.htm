&#62; &#62; &#62; 3. An interesting note on guardian is that the spell does seem to 
&#62; &#62; &#62; hurt your coop player. I was grouped with a rogue, and we had 
&#62; &#62; &#62; illusion weavers. The weavers would show up on the rogue or me, and 
&#62; &#62; &#62; the guardians would hit the rogue a lot. It seems that if you are 
&#62; &#62; &#62; close to a guardian, and in a line of fire between it and its target, 
&#62; &#62; &#62; you will get hit (although the guardian does not seem to hit me). Has 
&#62; &#62; &#62; anyone else noticed this? The rogue was not to pleased with my 
&#62; &#62; &#62; guardians killing her a couple times.
&#62; &#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; Lok
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Guardians are very hard on rogues.  Not only do we get
&#62; &#62; hit by their fireballs (both directly and &#34;splash&#34; damage it 
&#62; &#62; seems),
&#62; 
&#62; They fire firebolts, not fireballs, so there is no splash damage. 
&#62; Probably a guardian just hitting you with half of the firebolt and it 
&#62; looks like splash damage. Yes, I wish they threw fireballs.

Er, you're right, firebolts, no splash damage &#60;scratch, delete,
retract&#62;.  I still get hit, take damage, and have my shot/spell 
interrupted!  It's still a problem, isn't it?

&#62; 
&#62; &#62; but three or four can fill the screen with so much moving stuff
&#62; &#62; we can't see to aim (and _nobody_ likes that! :-) and worst of
&#62; &#62; all, every blooming critter in this room and all surrounding
&#62; &#62; rooms comes charging out at you all at once.  Then Mr. Hotshot
&#62; &#62; mage panicks and starts making like Nintendo Kid with the fire
&#62; &#62; button set for Chain Lightning.  
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Great.  Now your 150-200 hp lvl 30+ rogue has lightning, 
&#62; &#62; fireballs, _and_ monsters beating on her simultaneously, plus 
&#62; &#62; the screen is so cluttered she can't see what's going on.  I do 
&#62; &#62; not find this to be a very comfortable (or pleasant) situation 
&#62; &#62; to be in.  My mage and I had several intense discussions 
&#62; &#62; about this strategy before I was able to convince him that
&#62; &#62; this was a strategy best left for solo play.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Valesha - lvl 36 rogue
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Ok, let me address this point. The mage should not throw guardians in 
&#62; front of him, between the monsters and the party, at least in a 
&#62; multiplayer game. This is because warriors and some rogues will 
&#62; charge right into the mess of monsters and kill them, all the while 
&#62; they are getting hit in the butt by guardian. Try casting guardians 
&#62; in the midst of advancing monsters or behind monsters that are lined 
&#62; up  fighting the frontliners. It avoids that friendly fire problem.

With zig-zagging monsters, the only thing worse than throwing the
guardian behind the monsters is throwing them behind the players!
Bolts from the guardian behind the monsters miss the zagging monster 
and continue on, hitting the players.  Also, bolts fired at monsters 
which are killed (by rogue's arrows or warrior's sword) continue to 
fly, hitting the player(s) who killed the monster, while they are 
trying
to deal with another monster(s) who didn't happen to be the one
targeted by the guardian.

And no, I am _not_ a charge into the fray rogue, I didn't know there 
were such weirdos.  I am a tickle one or two monsters out, kill them 
at range, repeat, rogue.  If more than 1 or 2 monsters get to me it's 
time to bug out.  Retreat to live and fight another day.

&#62; 
&#62; Guardian is also really great against the non-immune (and I mean just 
&#62; non-immune, resist it works too) teleporters. The wizards are kept 
&#62; busy teleporting to fire.

In solo, guardian is a great weapon.  You can place them where
they will do you no harm.  You can use a wall of them to hold off
monsters from getting to you.  The occupy-the-enemy-while-you-
deal-with-them-separately trick you mention above is great.  

They are also useful as scouts - one just inside the doorway ahead.  
You see what direction the bolts go, and probably get a couple 
activated monsters to come out at you where you can deal with them 
in the hallway.  Much safer than in an open room.  (Elemental is even 
better for this)

But in multiplayer play, the guardian-caster is just as responsible 
for every bolt thrown by his guardians as a rogue is for every
arrow from her bow.  Friendly fire from guardians is just as 
inexcusable as from rogues, and complaining that the mage
can't choose where the bolts go is no excuse.  He has the
responsibility of ensuring that the guardian is cast in such a 
position that it will not be able to hit his teammates, or not
cast it at all.

Do you have any suggestions for specific placement of 
guardians in typical combined arms situations?  When you
and a rogue are sitting in the entrance of a &#34;room&#34; in hell,
with a fighter in front of you and monsters closing in from all
sides, where would you put the guardians?  What are the
other players supposed to do while you do your thing?

(I'm not being sarcastic here.  You like and promote the spell,
I have not been able to use it well.  I'm trying to pick your
brain for ideas I've apparently missed! :-)  My 23rd level mage
does enjoy using guardian in solo/multi, but hasn't ever even 
tried it in multi/multi.

&#62; 
&#62; Raleel, master of guardian-do
&#62; 
&#62; But seriously, I ABUSE guardian. I use it almost more than chain 
&#62; lightning. As far as I am concerned, if I never see the monster, it 
&#62; is still a clean kill.

Hey, my favorite kills are the monsters off the screen that I hit and
kill before I ever see them and before they ever fire a shot at me.

&#62; 
&#62; Another note, did you know you can stone curse monsters you can see 
&#62; with infravision, even behind walls?

Actually, you can stonecurse anything behind walls, even if you can't 
see it, if you click in the right spot.  At least it seems that way.  
I often
take on specials (especially the two uniques guarding Laz) this way.
I activate them with a well placed arrow or two, step around the 
corner, and wait.  When the little glowing square gets to the corner,
I stone curse it.  They show up in front of me stoned, and I proceed
to turn them into gravel.  Maybe the curse isn't actually taking 
effect
until they become visible?  Hmmm, I may have to play with this some.
