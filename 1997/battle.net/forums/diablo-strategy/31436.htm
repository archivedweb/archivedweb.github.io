<pre>MK'ing would have to get VERY advanced.  This may come off as 
gloating, but it would be fairly difficult to MK a high-level 
sorcerer who was looking for it.  (That is, let's say that this MK 
happens to me once- I'll be careful in the future to try and avoid 
it).  May as well use myself as an example here.  I always have my MS 
activated when entering a level or portal.  Now, these other players 
would have to activate a lot of monsters in a way that will be 
powerful enough to kill me, but still allow them to kill the rest of 
the horde and thus claim my items.  This would be a fine line, to say 
the least.  Of course the other option is to shoot one or two arrows 
at me in the hopes of dropping my shield at an opportune time; 
however, with Teleport hotkeyed, this would also be somewhat 
difficult to do.  If they try once and fail, then I have the 
opportunity to do the same to them later in the game, or just leave 
in general.  Also, it would be more difficult to see which sorcerers 
have great items, as their HP total is no reflection at all on their 
power.  I'm not sure what my point is here:  I just think it would be 
fairly difficult to achieve MK consistently.  (i.e. most players 
would abandon it because it would just be too difficult to achieve a 
high rate of success).  I could be wrong on this, too.  Since I'm not 
an MK'er myself, there may be far better ways to do this of which I 
am not aware.

I have a similar view about clan formation, though.  I don't feel 
that cheating has much of an impact on it.  There are always going to 
be people you like to play with better than others.  I'm guessing 
that even within your own clan, there are some players you more 
regularly adventure with for various reasons.  This is in human 
nature, also.  People are going to unite into groups to feel a sense 
of security and, in some cases, social order.  Cheating might drive 
more people to join a clan sooner, but in the long run I do not think 
it will have a significant impact on clans.

As for myself, I've been fortunate in that I've always had friends to 
play with (these would be real friends as opposed to 
&#34;virtual&#34; ones), and I have never been purposefully PK'ed.  
Of course, I only played in about 3 public games ever- and these were 
early on in the game's life- long before the first patch came out, by 
way of comparison.  I knew right away that public games weren't for 
me- whether or not anyone there was cheating.  The reader should 
probably keep this in mind when perusing this post.
