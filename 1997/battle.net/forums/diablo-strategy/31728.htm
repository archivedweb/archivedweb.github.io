<pre>All code did was list a few of the grey areas.  As a rhetorical 
question, look at the following items and see if you would consider 
them to be 'cheating'.

Duping items via the 'bug' in diablo.

Duping items via using a backup program.

Duping items via copying the diablo character files.

Using a trainer to give all spells as skills

Using a trainer to give spells above level 20

Using a trainer to give unlimited gold

Using a trainer to give immunity from all monsters

Using a hack to give the levels all 'boss monsters'

Using a hack to make gris, wirt, and/or adria sell you those really 
rare items

Using a hack to create your own items

Using dreamflange rings, demonspike rings, GPOW indestructable, and 
all other known (or imaginable) hacked items.

I would hope that ALL people (especially those that consider 
themselves legit) would consider ALL of these things to be cheating.
Life is full of grey areas.  That doesn't mean you can't distinguish 
right from wrong.   I remember one time having to debate in school 
for a pro-censorship position.  At first I thought, no way, we're 
gonna lose this debate, censorship is BAD.  But, after thinking about 
it, our group revealed these things that make censorship seem OK, 
such as:

1.  Counterfitting Money is illegal.  - thats censorship, but 'good' 
censorship

2.  Its illegal for the media to release the names of minors involved 
in crimes - thats censorship, but 'good' censorship

3.  Its illegal for the media to release the names of victims in 
fatal accidents until their families are notified.   - thats 
censorship, but 'good' censorship.

4.  Its illegal to defame or lie about someone in the media (what the 
hell is the word I'm thinking of here?).   - thats censorship, but 
'good' censorship.

5.  Its illegal for collection agencies to call you at work if you 
request them not to.   - thats censorship, but 'good' censorship

the list goes on and on.

So, there are 'grey' areas to cheating/legitness that each person (or 
clan) must decide on their own.  But there are a LOT more cases where 
everyone agrees that a particular action is/is not cheating.  So all 
code did was alert us to the fact that someone's definition of 
'legit' can be slightly different than another persons.  It doesnt 
make either person a 'cheater', its just that both people are 'legit' 
under slightly different rules.  Since there is no battlenet congress 
to pass laws and a judicial system to review them, we are stuck with 
slightly different definitions of 'legit'.  But its a LOT better than 
free-for-all cheating which could be happening (and IS Happening in 
public games).  So calling yourself legit is an activity which 
'should' continue, as long as YOU consider yourself truly legit (and 
you are being honest with yourself).
