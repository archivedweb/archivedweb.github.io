<pre>&#62; Where do you get this crap from?  You don't have any sense my dear 
&#62; friend?  Name anything in life that doesn't slowly die??  Got any?  
&#62; Doubt it!!  Oh, a rock!!

Not so..I can think of many things that I have done all my life that 
still are quite interesting to me....like sports, hobbies, etc.


&#62; Are you just making this up as you go?  I have yet to have the same 
&#62; items since day one, I keep getting better items or I started a new 
&#62; character.  Have you tried multi player?  And had a challenging game?

Technically, the games are not the same. However, how much different 
is a game with a few walls rearranged and a few diff items presented? 
 


&#62; Yeah, the 12 year olds!! 
&#62;
Wrong!!!! I have played since the game was released back in January i 
think....Most people cheat to some degree. Cheating has gotten so bad 
that only g-mode players are considered cheaters these days. 
Technically, if you even have a duped item you are a cheater. I bet 
90&#37; of the players on bnet have duped items whether they know it 
or not. 

Most of my friends on bnet cheat and try to lie about it. I don't 
really mind b/c they are cool guys.....and yes, most of them are over 
20 yrs old.



&#62; Last time I looked Starcraft is right around the corner!  And then 
&#62; the new Warcraft game.  I would have to believe no company puts out a 
&#62; sequel within a year of realeasing the original.  Give them a good 
&#62; year or year and a half, to release a new Diablo.  Look at Warcraft, 
&#62; Warcraft 2 came out over a year later.
&#62; 
&#62; Patience is a virtue my friend.  Realize a great game and applaud it!!

Diablo was a great game...but it is too limited. After coops for a 
month I tired of them. After dueling for 4 months I tired of them too 
:(  

Too bad b/c I once really liked to duel, but now I realize that no 
matter how good you are, the action of the game prevents you from 
getting significantly better. Those of you that played Street fighter 
II in the old days when the game was still a game of skill will 
understand what I am talking about. That game you could play forever 
and progressively improve at it almost like a sport. Diablo is really 
a contest of half decent reflexes combined with whoever can get their 
hands on the best stuff.

Don't believe me? Think I am full of crap? Well, look around the 
forums and tell me a veteran's name that still posts in this forum or 
in odgen's tavern. You know what? The only veterans left only post 
and play Diablo just so they can &#34;hang&#34; with their friends. 
When I look at the names in these forums, I see all newbie posts. 


Don't get me wrong, I think Diablo is a really great game. I still 
play it once a week maybe. I once played every day for hours and 
hours! Now....I have returned to WC2. So until Diablo 2, I'll be 
training ogres and smashing stuff :)</pre>
