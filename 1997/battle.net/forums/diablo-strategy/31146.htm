&#62; this is what happened today, i was playing with this guy (dont wanna 
&#62; mention his name). he knew nothing of this game. a level 10 warrior. 
&#62; he was legit though, i ll give him that. after awhile i thought he 
&#62; was ok and asked him if he wanna join my clan, he said, no thx im a 
&#62; leader of a clan. then i thought hmmm maybe this guy is koo. he 
&#62; insist that i check his web page out and it was something geocities, 
&#62; the really slow web pages... well geocities is already slow enough 
&#62; and on top of that, he had all these pics on it. i skip all that and 
&#62; wanna check out his clan and members. i clicked on members and i see 
&#62; nothing, so i thought maybe he doesn't list them. so i asked him how 
&#62; many members? after a slight pause, he said 2. i was... &#37;$&^*&# 
&#62; 
&#62; u call that a clan? and i advice him to give it up and he didn't take 
&#62; it that well and just left. 
&#62; 
&#62; an advice to all u out there who wants to or have a clan. if u dont 
&#62; have time and if ur not dedicated to build a clan give it up! merge 
&#62; with some other clan, it ll do u and ur members a favor! this is what 
&#62; gives these clan a bad name. these new clans comes up and they go. so 
&#62; their members starts to build friends and trust in the clan, and 
&#62; their leaders give up. leaving these poor legit members hanging. 
&#62; 
&#62; if u have 2 members in ur so call clan, pls dont call it a clan.

DarkSniper,

I'll cut to the chase.  That was just plain rude.  So what if he only 
has two members?  Big deal.  Doesn't he have to start somewhere?  I 
can't say that I blame him for taking it badly and leaving.  I doubt 
that I'd want to listen to that holier-than-thou crap, either.  Why 
can't you just let him play the game the way he likes?

I'd guess that you're the kind of person who always shops at Wal-Mart 
and never supports local small businesses.

Since I'll probably get flamed for this anyway ...
if u never learned how to use the &#34;shift&#34; key or how to spell 
&#34;you&#34;, &#34;are&#34;, &#34;will&#34;, etc., pls take the time 
to do so.
