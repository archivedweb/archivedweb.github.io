&#62; After reading Code Myster's comment about him getting better armor 
&#62; drops while running hell without armor, I started thinking. It seems 
&#62; like the best objects I see usually are around character levels 25-
&#62; 29. It is in that level region where I usually find the suit of plate 
&#62; which I still use into my late 30's, and it is in that level region 
&#62; where I find cool uniques like windforce, etc. I have also noticed 
&#62; that after a rebuild from scratch with no objects, I get great 
&#62; objects rapidly. Code Mysters's comment and my old history seemed to 
&#62; point to a bias in the game towards giving good drops to those who 
&#62; have little.
&#62; 
&#62; So the theory is 'Do you get better drops when you are naked?'. To 
&#62; test this I ran 4 laz runs in normal hell, where I would go down 
&#62; naked and clear level 15. The only mentionable item I got was a 
&#62; royale circlet, which was useless to me as I already had one.
&#62; 
&#62; I did notice something interesting though. When I would come into the 
&#62; game, I would drop everything and remove all equipment, then go visit 
&#62; Grizwald. In game 1, I was offered a kings claymore of the heavens (I 
&#62; bought it). In game 3 I was offered a kings scimitar of sorcery (did 
&#62; not buy it). I also noticed that I got full plate offers from 
&#62; grizwald in 2 of the 4 games.
&#62; 
&#62; Now 4 games is not statistical sample, but I haven't been offered 
&#62; kings weapons since level 23 or so. Now at level 38 I get 2 kings 
&#62; weapons in the space of 2 games at Grizwalds. Is this a trend or 
&#62; coincidence?
&#62; 
&#62; Has anyone else found that Grizwald likes nudists?

Lok,

Interesting post.  I agree with the theory.  It seems to make sense
that you should be offered better items when you need them 
most.  There is one point I'm confused on, though.

I'm wondering, now, when is Griswold's shop &#34;seeded&#34;?  I had 
assumed that it was when the game was created (or when you 
level up or buy something).  If this were the case, Griswold's 
inventory would only reflect the character's need if you ENTERED
the game naked.  Your experience with dropping everything 
and then visiting him seems to imply that he's seeded the first 
time you visit him.

Anyway, it beats me which is actually the case.  Just thought I'd
throw out that point.
