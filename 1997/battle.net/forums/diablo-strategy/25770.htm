<pre>Hey all,

OK, I have a level 37 sorcerer named Binkley, who recently got his 
third dot solo, and I must say that I found Hell/Hell to be, how 
shall I say, not what it is hyped to be.  It really wasn't that bad.  
A major difference between Hell/Hell and easier difficulty levels are 
the immune-all Soulburners and Advocates.  I ran into both on my way, 
and I submit that with good resistances, these guys are hardly that 
difficult.  The Stone Curse/hack/Golem approach is tedious, but not 
terribly difficult to employ.  The reason is that with the 700-900 
mana that a high-level mage will normally have, you can take a lot of 
punishment while you go about stoning everything.  My approach was 
basically Stone anything in sight, then blast the non-immune 
creatures to pieces, then work on the immune-all stuff.  I didn't 
even use Infravision.  I never got into a situation where survival 
was an issue.  Now, to save time, I only cleared each level to the 
stairs, plus Laz, and I only cleared part of level 16 and 
Telekinesised the last two levers.  But I feel that my tactics would 
have allowed me to clear every level with little or no serious 
problems, regardless of seeding.

Now maybe I just have really great stuff for a mage in his mid-30s.  
Judge for yourself:
Awesome Full Plate
Dreamflange
Sapphire Helm of Sorcery
Stormshield
Ruby Amulet of the Zodiac
Ring of the Zodiac
Jade Ring of the Stars

All legitimately found or purchased from Gris.  I have AC 243 and 
basically maxed resistances.  I feel I've been pretty lucky in 
finding stuff, but I think mages with lesser setups could handle 
Hell/Hell with few problems as well.

I don't know, maybe I wouldn't call Hell/Hell easy, but it certainly 
is not difficult, for a mage.  My rogue had a much harder time 
getting her third dot.  And I could see how warriors would get their 
ass whipped big time.  What do y'all think?
