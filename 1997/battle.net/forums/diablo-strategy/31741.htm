<pre>Skyye,

     I have tried King's Flail of haste and King's Sword of Vampire, 
which I bought and found.  I thought the Haste would really help out 
the mage, but it really didn't.  It speeded up just a little bit. The 
King's Sword of Vampire is cool on mages, but since you get less than 
5 mana/hit(since damage is less than 100, it comes down around 3 to 4 
mana per hit) it doesn't do much for a mages who have total mana of 
around 850 or above. (It still helps :) I prefer useing staff. 
(king's war staff of Haste would be great for those nasty triple 
immunes.)  I personally use AA Ressurect. I love the staff. If anyone 
of the party member dies, they can be ressurected using the staff and 
+2 to magic lvl doesn't hurt. :)  I have AAA (12 charges, best I 
bought so far other than bountiful staff of apoc (30 charges but got 
stolen :( )  and AA firball.

Lestat, lost and confused.

P.S. Mages are meant to use Staff.  Those dirty sword and shield 
aren't for mages. 8p

&#62; Someone else also mentioned the King's Sword of Haste--this is an 
&#62; excellent sword for the mage, as it counter-balances the mage's 
&#62; weakness as a melee fighter and mage's relatively slow swing-speed.  
&#62; I've used this sword with my mage (bought the broadsword version from 
&#62; Griz for about 80k) and it worked very well.
&#62; 
&#62; Another excellent sword for the mage would be a King's (or Master's) 
&#62; Sword of Vampire, so you could constantly replenish your mana shield 
&#62; and spell-casting ability every time you hit an attacker.  This would 
&#62; be really, really cool.  I personally have never found or bought one, 
&#62; but I am always on the lookout for one.
&#62; 
&#62; As for boosting your magic levels with the sword, forget it--that's 
&#62; what rings and amulets are for.  I had a Master's Sword of Sorcery 
&#62; but I found I was much better off with a different suffix (like 
&#62; Haste) that would counter the inherent weaknesses of the mage--and 
&#62; not merely add to areas that the mage is already strong in.
&#62; 
&#62; hope this helps...</pre>
