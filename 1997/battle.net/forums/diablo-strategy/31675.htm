<pre>See below for answers. Briefly, don't confuse cheating with game 
challenge. Cheating involves doing something not possible in the 
basic game. Duping is exploiting a bug to the detriment of the game, 
and also a cheat. Everyone needs to determine their own challenge 
level for the game within a non cheating context. I posted this 
without reading other responses.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?

No. Blizard intended gold to be traded, and put no level restrictions 
on its trade. If you want a challenge, you will earn the gold 
yourself. Personally I will accept some gold when I am short, but I 
won't take piles of it when I am building up a character (levels 1-
20). After 20th, you can always run nightmare church, and gold is not 
an issue.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?

Depends- No, if the item was legitimately found and not duped or 
hacked. These items are not part of the game, and by owning a copy of 
one you compound the problem. Yes, if the item is duped or hacked, as 
you compound the problem by keeping another copy in circulation. If 
you wish to have a challenging game, you will not accept any items 
from others. I had 1 clan character accept items, and 2 not accept 
items (one I was role playing a code against taking charity). 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?

Nope. Bliz did not put any restrictions on transferring objects from 
one player to the next. The game is not as challenging if you have 
items beyond your character's level. Most of my characters have 
avoided this.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?

If the elixirs were duped, yes. If its the spectral elixir, yes. If 
it is a normal elixir, nope. The game is not as challenging if you 
accept elixirs from others. Personally I will accept elixirs bought 
in the game I am in by someone I am cooperatively playing with.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?

No. The other player isn't going to get much experience by doing 
this. Most of my characters don't do this.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
Adria or Griz for items?

No. Multiplayer games objects were reduced in power and frequency, 
and game balance for multiplayer games takes object surfing into 
account. Blizzard did not intend people to play multiplayer games 
straight through to the end from level 1.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?

I don't know what this software is. It was not part of the original 
game, and hence is a cheat.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?

Nope. Blizard did not impose adventuring level restrictions beyond 
the nightmare and hell game restrictions. 

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold 
&#62; extra items?

This one is iffy. I think one of the games greatest challenges is to 
get by with 40 slots of inventory. This bypasses that challenge. I 
personally abstain from this. Technically this is not cheating. You 
better have a buddy you can trust if you do this. I certainly would 
not duel with another who did this.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?

Technically no. It does reduce game challenge dramatically. I prefer 
to keep objects with the character who found it- its part of that 
characters history. Yeah its tempting to transfer that choice goodie, 
but think how rewarding it will be to finally find it on your own.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?

No. All of these spells with side affects kill. Personally I would 
rather have the option of configuring a game to eliminate collatoral 
player damage.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?

Nope. Its a pretty clever and inventive use of portal.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?

Yes. No spells should work in town. Blizzard made the game needlessly 
tedious by puting everything so far apart.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?

Yes. Blizard intended the game to have no save for multiplayer. That 
is clear from the elaborate lengths they went to hide player files. 
Personally I view a crash as part of the characters history, and a 
chance to start all over fresh.

&#62; 
&#62; Anwer honestly! I'll post later with my views on the above later 
&#62; today.
