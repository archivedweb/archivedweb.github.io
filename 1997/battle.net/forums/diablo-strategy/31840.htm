<pre>first thank u for restating ur point on cheating

&#34;Anyway I will state my position 1 last time for everyone: I am 
an old 
              timer. I detested cheaters. Cheating started the day 
diablo came out, 
              long before anyone ever &#34;created&#34; a cheat. 
Anyone remember 
              &#34;Modem drop dup&#34;? How about &#34;Portal 
Dup&#34;? These 
              existed from the beginning and people took advantage of 
them. I hated 
              them for it. I was a purist.&#34;

cos for awhile i misinterpurit that u were trying to say cheating is 
ok. and the world without cheat part convinced me thats what u wanted.


now the post below has nothing to do with u, well the owning of the 
forum, yes but not the flaming part.

i did have respect for u code, even when we r having those 
arguements, but i lost the respect in 2 issues. the first time when u 
said i make stuff up. i dont and i dont see a reason to. u apologized 
and i was fine with it. now this time, u think i stated that i own 
this forum. now thats when i lost my respect for u. u cheat, i m fine 
with it, as long as u dont effect others and myself. u post, yes i do 
disagree with u, but i never lost my respect for u in any debates.

i ll make this point one more time. i DO NOT care what people think 
of me. i say whats on my mind. the post below is to clarify myself to 
people who dont know me that well. if u wanna hate me, at least let 
me explain who m i first. 

now call me stubborn, but i have my principals. in ur bury the hacket 
post, u only stated stuff about the debate. which as i stated i dont 
mind. but its ur statement that claims i m trying to take the channel 
over that really pissed me off. now if u would like to respond to 
that, it will be appreciated.
