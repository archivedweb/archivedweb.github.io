&#62; I haven't posted here in a long time.  My CPU crashed and a lvl22 
&#62; Qqazres (2 legitimate dots, I had DS on the edge of his seat).  But 
&#62; now the BNM thing is getting kind of old.  So I thought I'd write 
&#62; this post.  In reply to Woody's quiz  I would be a Tweener.  But I 
&#62; think that some questions were off target.  For Instance if ds rot n 
&#62; sa abut Allifer Tist he mite loos hiz mind n try 2 shoot duh wf  up 
&#62; hiz .... Well you get the picture.  Also in regards to the I will die 
&#62; if I dont post question , I know I could not go through three days 
&#62; without flaming Kalibos (hey where is he????)  That all about Woody's 
&#62; quiz!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;            NOW I would like to address Bostic and the Forum Police
&#62; 
&#62; I think you should know that in John's &#34;goodbye&#34; post he 
&#62; might have added in some &#34;UO SPAM&#34; .  Arent you going to 
&#62; harrass him to know end?   
&#62; 
&#62; AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  I tried to get through this post without 
&#62; it happening but now I must confess, for the last week I have 
&#62; secretly been channeling the speret uf dursknipper et d most opretin 
&#62; times.  I well now return too my qqazres ferm.  Ahh!  Its good to be 
&#62; back!
&#62; 
&#62; Where did Lok go?????????
&#62; 
&#62; Where did Aahz go????????
&#62; 
&#62; Where did Kal go??????
&#62; 
&#62; Boohoo noone to flame.  Except ds !
&#62; 
&#62; Qqazres pop quiz question.
&#62; 
&#62; If ds FB'd Woody in the fast lane for driving to slow , and then 
&#62; found out his wf is a dup, would Bostic drop his book through a table 
&#62; before Kalibos was ever serious???
&#62; 
&#62; Now you know what happens when I get really really bored!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; Answers to questions
&#62; 
&#62; 1)if you said ds was never smart enuf 2 red a bok uf fb den u wer 
&#62; rite.
&#62; 
&#62; 2)If you bothered to care your'e just a nerd
&#62; 
&#62; 3)If you thought Kalibos would ever be serious your'e an even bigger 
&#62; nerd
