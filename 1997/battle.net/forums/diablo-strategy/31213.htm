&#62; &#62; &#62; first thing, i admit i was rude. but im like that, im very blunt.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I'm blunt too, so you should like this reply.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; yeah blunt is good, but u also have to read what i posted

 Listen up both Darksniper and Fire_Made_Flesh, the two bluntest 
characters on B.net( are you two role-playing?)


&#62; &#62; &#62; u 2 dont understand what it takes to create a sucessful clan. it take 
&#62; &#62; &#62; time and dedication, this kid is still using his fathers email 
&#62; &#62; &#62; account, now how is he gonna start a clan? it is damn tuff to start a 
&#62; &#62; &#62; clan my friends. look at inferno, one of the largest clan in bnet. 
&#62; &#62; &#62; now look what happened to it. destroyed. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; There are clans out there who don't send e-mail between members.  
&#62; &#62; They just post it all on a web page.  Not the safest way, but when 
&#62; &#62; you don't have many members, it's possible.
&#62; 
&#62; that would be a complete mess if some cheaters wanna destroy ur clan. 
&#62; a pure useless idea. and when i said he does have an email, i meant 
&#62; he is too young and inexperence. if u dont have ur own email, how the 
&#62; hell r ur members gonna find u when they have a question? post in the 
&#62; web page? u know how inconvinent it is?

  Both E-mails and web boards are good. E-mails can be used for 
security measures, web boards can be used for general discussion. 
 Clan Legit's E-mails and boards are used extensively. Darksniper, 
there are people posting here asking for you, perhaps you should set 
up your own web board. :)

&#62; &#62; A couple things.  I have never joined a guild that requires members 
&#62; &#62; to have a mark in their name.  I'm not cattle, I don't need to be 
&#62; &#62; branded.  But, I did join many guilds that had problems with 
&#62; &#62; cheaters.  They were the thing that lead me to create my guild.  If 
&#62; &#62; people need to mark their members to keep track of them, they have 
&#62; &#62; serious problems.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; i agree with u, but seemingly, over half of the clan dont. look at 
&#62; the big 2, inferno and snakegod. and a lot of other clans. and that 
&#62; is what happened to me when i joined my first clan. just using it as 
&#62; an example to show how bad it feels when a clan is down.

  Fire_Made_Flesh, didn't you said something about wearing guild 
colours in UO? :) 
 But Diablo is Diablo, UO is UO...

&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; &#62; u need to know a lot of things to be a leader, not just how to make a 
&#62; &#62; &#62;  nice web page. 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Not necessarily.  I mean, if you have a nice page, and someone who 
&#62; &#62; could monitor the guild actually joins your clan, then you don't have 
&#62; &#62; to really do any work.  :)
&#62; 
&#62; then u wouldnt be a true leader would u? i mean, yeah u can tell this 
&#62; guy to do something and that guy to do others. but in conclusion, if 
&#62; u dont really do any work, then ur not a true leader. ur just a 
&#62; person with the highest rank who do jac.

 I believe you two have better things to do then irk each other.
 Leaders are important, so is having fellow guild members to help out 
the clan. 
 Leaders do not have that much time to handle a guild alone, they 
have a life too you know.
 

&#62;   So, anyone who thinks starting as a 2 person guild, can look 
&#62; &#62; at the 160+ member Clan Legit, one of the larger non-cheating non-pk 
&#62; &#62; guilds on Battle.net, and realize that lots of things are possible. 
&#62; 
&#62; as i said before if u read my post. the numbers of members means 
&#62; nothing. i can say i have 130. i saw that clan from melissa that has 
&#62; 600. and some clan has over a 1000. so? dont tell me u see 160+ 
&#62; members everyday in ur channel. and dont tell me u have 40 games open 
&#62; per nite. i dont think so eh? if it is true, put me down as one of ur 
  The numbers of the clan are important, it has to be accurate. Clan 
Legit has 140 plus members (160? I think FMF exaggerated) some of 
them play some of the time, some seldom play. Why would anyone want 
to play with so many members at one time? Diablo can only handle 4 in 
one game. :)

&#62; DarkSniper

 Darksniper, if you want to merge Clan Legit and Angels Of Hell 
together, here is a proposal I have. You can shut your clan down, 
tell your members that you are going to Clan Legit and tell them that 
they can join it if they want. They will all have to be screened of 
course. :) 
 This could pose a huge security risk to Clan Legit so FMF may not 
agree to it. If need be, only selected members of your clan get to 
join. There are also other ways, but I'll just wait and see.
 Getting cocky now that your clan is large? Well the same could be 
said of Fire_Made_Flesh. :)
 Talk like Pat N, it helps. :)

 Mana-Flux(BP) Ho I'm branded correct? :) Mooo!
 PS: Darksniper, were you the one who posted at Clan Legit's web 
board? And I couldn't make it to the meeting tonight, I don't come 
here often too you know. :)</pre>
