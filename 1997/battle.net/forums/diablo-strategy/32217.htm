<pre> First off, that was not a &#34;flame.&#34; It was a legitimate 
attempt to shed a little light on the subject from my perspective.  
Also, your assumption that all of the post was in reply to one of 
YOUR earlier posts was not only a little vain, but incorrect.  I saw 
many, many, many posts regarding the Godly dilemma, and one said that 
godly plate did not exist, and one that said gpow could not be 
bought.  Both of those are WRONG, which I think you'll agree with. 
 You seem to be someone who has a good understanding of this game, 
and who doesn't mind helping others out, based on your performace in 
this forum.  I hold the utmost respect for anyone who, like myself, 
plays this game somewhat seriously, has a good time, and wants others 
to as well.  
 Anyway-here's what I'm saying. Hopefully this time it will be more 
clear. 

1) Godly Plate of the Whale exists in multiplayer. I was offered 
Breast style from Wirt, and a resonably low cost (120k, i think).
2) A friend of mine who is very trustworth claims to have found Godly 
Full Plate of the Ages in a barrel.  I see no reason not to believe 
him, since the incident happened early in Diablo (like late Jan.), 
although I have no proof that it did actually occur.
3) Blizzard support is retarded (no offense guys, but get on the ball 
and stop bullshitting to shut us up. Pardon my French).  King's bows 
exist, but are very rare.  GFP exists, but is very rare.  Um...DUH? I 
though you found them every time you killed a fallen one...Either 
give some concrete answers, or leave us in the dark.  
4) I have spent WAY too much time playing this game.

No hard feelings
