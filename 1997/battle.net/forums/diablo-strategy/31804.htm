&#62; All code did was list a few of the grey areas.  As a rhetorical

&#62; 
&#62; Duping items via the 'bug' in diablo.
&#62; 
&#62; Duping items via using a backup program.
&#62; 
&#62; Duping items via copying the diablo character files.
&#62; 
&#62; Using a trainer to give all spells as skills
&#62; 
&#62; Using a trainer to give spells above level 20
&#62; 
&#62; Using a trainer to give unlimited gold
&#62; 
&#62; Using a trainer to give immunity from all monsters
&#62; 
&#62; Using a hack to give the levels all 'boss monsters'
&#62; 
&#62; Using a hack to make gris, wirt, and/or adria sell you those really 
&#62; rare items
&#62; 
&#62; Using a hack to create your own items
&#62; 
&#62; Using dreamflange rings, demonspike rings, GPOW indestructable, and 
&#62; all other known (or imaginable) hacked items.
&#62; 
&#62; I would hope that ALL people (especially those that consider 
&#62; themselves legit) would consider ALL of these things to be cheating.
&#62; Life is full of grey areas.  That doesn't mean you can't distinguish 
&#62; right from wrong.   I remember one time having to debate in school 
&#62; for a pro-censorship position.  At first I thought, no way, we're 
&#62; gonna lose this debate, censorship is BAD.  But, after thinking about 
&#62; it, our group revealed these things that make censorship seem OK, 
&#62; such as:
&#62; 
&#62; 1.  Counterfitting Money is illegal.  - thats censorship, but 'good' 
&#62; censorship
&#62; 
&#62; 2.  Its illegal for the media to release the names of minors involved 
&#62; in crimes - thats censorship, but 'good' censorship
&#62; 
&#62; 3.  Its illegal for the media to release the names of victims in 
&#62; fatal accidents until their families are notified.   - thats 
&#62; censorship, but 'good' censorship.
&#62; 
&#62; 4.  Its illegal to defame or lie about someone in the media (what the 
&#62; hell is the word I'm thinking of here?).   - thats censorship, but 
&#62; 'good' censorship.
&#62; 
&#62; 5.  Its illegal for collection agencies to call you at work if you 
&#62; request them not to.   - thats censorship, but 'good' censorship
&#62; 
&#62; the list goes on and on.
&#62; 
&#62; So, there are 'grey' areas to cheating/legitness that each person (or 
&#62; clan) must decide on their own.  But there are a LOT more cases where 
&#62; everyone agrees that a particular action is/is not cheating.  So all 
&#62; code did was alert us to the fact that someone's definition of 
&#62; 'legit' can be slightly different than another persons.  It doesnt 
&#62; make either person a 'cheater', its just that both people are 'legit' 
&#62; under slightly different rules.  Since there is no battlenet congress 
&#62; to pass laws and a judicial system to review them, we are stuck with 
&#62; slightly different definitions of 'legit'.  But its a LOT better than 
&#62; free-for-all cheating which could be happening (and IS Happening in 
&#62; public games).  So calling yourself legit is an activity which 
&#62; 'should' continue, as long as YOU consider yourself truly legit (and 
&#62; you are being honest with yourself).
