<pre>POP QUIZ:  Are you a Gamer, a Player or a Nerd?

Standard disclaimer: This post has no strategy what-so-ever.  Nor do 
hardly any of my posts these days.  I like to help newbies now and 
again, but the strategy stuff has all been covered for the most part 
and now days it’s just re-hash.  Not that there isn’t an obscure tip 
yet to be discovered, I’m sure there is.  I just don’t play enough 
anymore to discover it.  So this is what you can expect from me: 
ramblings, jests and the occasional flame.

Ok boys and girls, here is a pop quiz from Woody.  Please be honest 
in your answers, the results will be kept confidential.  Also, no 
looking at your neighbors paper because, well, your only cheating 
yourself.

Instructions: This is a multiple choice quiz.  On a piece of paper, 
with a #2 pencil, read each question thoroughly and record your 
answer.  Grades will be handed out at the end.

Sample Question: 
Question #2: Your real life personality and that of your Diablo 
persona are…
A)  Incomparable.  I don’t have an identifiable persona
B)  Similar.  My ethical and moral values generally tend to be the 
same, aside from an occasional pkill :)
C)  Blurred beyond salvation.  I regularly confuse the two.  I catch 
myself trying to fireball people that drive real slow in the fast 
lane.

Now, in the above example, if DarkSniper was taking the quiz, his 
thought process might be along these lines.  &#34;Hmmm, I just wrot 
tha essae on Oliver Twist titled ‘Oliver Twist: If he d a WF, he d 
sure as $#!T woulda got more porrige!’ so I guess I d pick c.&#34;

Get it?  Good.  Well, what are you waiting for?  The clock is ticking…

Question #1: How many hours a week do you spend playing Diablo?
A)  0-6
B)  7-14
C)  15+

Question #2: Your real life personality and that of your Diablo 
persona are…
A)  Incomparable.  I don’t have an identifiable persona
B)  Similar.  My ethical and moral values generally tend to be the 
same, aside from an occasional pkill J
C)  Blurred beyond salvation.  I regularly confuse the two.  I catch 
myself trying to fireball people that drive real slow in the fast 
lane.

Question #3: Your favorite character is…
A)  I don’t have one, I like and play them all
B)  I have one class I like the best, but I’ve experimented with them 
all
C)  I absolutely LOVE that character I created when I first bought 
the game in January!  Once, I had a hard drive crash and I went into 
a coma.  My mom had to send the drive off to a data recovery company 
to wake me from my sleep.

Question #4:  Describe your typical Battle.Net time.
A)  I just roam in and out of the public games until I find some cool 
people to play with
B)  I roam the public channels and a couple of guild ones.  I chat a 
bit and play a bit.
C)  I go to a private guild channel and stay there.  All night.  All 
day.  I’m always there.  Everyone knows me.  I survive on Tic-Tacs 
and Mountain Dew.

Question #5:  Are you involved in any Diablo communities?
A)  Nah, I don’t have the time.  Besides, the pubs are fine with me.
B)  I’m in a guild.  It’s a cool break from all the cheaters in the 
public games.  I’ve met some cool people that I adventure with semi-
regularly
C)  I founded a clan.  You better not say a damn thing about us 
either.  If you do, we’ll circle the wagons and hire bounty hunters 
to track you down and bring us your ear.  That’s if we don’t get it 
first.  So just shut up!  Were the best there is and that’s that!  No 
one is gonna defile my clan and get away with it!

Question #6: Do you read or post on any Diablo related forums?
A)  I mostly just read.  I post questions on occasion, but for the 
most part I’m a lurker
B)  I read and post on a semi-regular basis.  I have a nickname that 
some/most people recognize.
C)  I read and post every damn day.  In fact, I go through 
withdrawals if I can’t post for more than 3 days at a time.  In a 
perfect world, I wouldn’t have to sleep and I could post my limit 
24/7.

Question #7: How do you feel about cheaters?
A)  To each his own.  They paid the same for the game as I did.
B)  Cheaters have ruined the public games for me.  That’s a main 
reason I joined a guild
C)  Cheaters are scum!  I hope they all burn in hell!  Die! Die! Die!

Question #8: What other sorts of games do you like?
A)  I like the big ones.  You know, Quake, Red Alert, Warcraft 2, etc…
B)  I have a diverse collection.  Some of the big ones and a few of 
the lesser known titles.  I still play them all
C)  What the hell kind of question is that?!?  There is no other game 
that has ever been produced that is as cool as Diablo.  You should go 
to hell with the cheaters for speaking such heresy!

Question #9:  What game are you most looking forward to?
A)  None really, I don’t pay attention to games in development, I get 
most of my games at Christmas and birthdays, so I take what I get.
B)  Starcraft is looking pretty good.  I thought I’d like the 
Hellfire expansion pack for Diablo, but without multiplayer support, 
I won’t buy it.
C)  Hellfire and Diablo 2.  End of discussion!


Ok times up.  Lets see how you did.

The quiz is pretty straight forward.  The &#34;A&#34; answers are 
things that a Gamer would say.  This is the type of player that plays 
casually and only thinks of Diablo as an action game and nothing 
more.  The &#34;B&#34; answers are the types of things that a Player 
would say.  This type of individual has explored the role playing 
aspect of Diablo and found it very satisfying.  The &#34;C&#34; 
answers are typical of Nerds.  These guys and gals have no real 
social life.  They eat drink and sleep Diablo.

Scoring.  If you answered in one category only, that’s your grade.  
Your a pure Gamer, Player or Nerd.  If your answers were both A’s and 
B’s, your a tweener.  That means that you have the tendencies of 
both.  If you answered ANY question with a &#34;C&#34;, your a total 
Nerd and beyond hope.  Get a life.

:)

Class dismissed.
