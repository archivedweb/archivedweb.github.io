<pre>Glad to see that classes have resumed after the seminar on &#34;What 
is Cheating?&#34;

Your CL tactic is one I have often used myself.  In terms of 
positioning yourself for efficient kill zones, a corner is generally 
better than a wall unless the wall is in an hallway.  I generally 
don't retreat very far to find the most efficient kill zone. . . just 
a step or two back down the hallway to have the monsters line up very 
nicely (this is a great way to take out Soulburners in Nightmare 
Hell), or at most form a little wedge (in the case of flankers, 
zigzaggers, etc.) that is less than 90 degrees.  I think we all agree 
that the effective use of CL depends on positioning.

Timing also plays a role.  Trying to hit flankers and zigzaggers 
while they're still moving some distance away is a waste of mana 
(unless, of course, their range of movement is limited, such as in a 
hallway). If it's just one or two monsters, and as a member of the 
heavily-armored mage club (my AC ranges from 250 to 305 or so, 
depending upon the configuration), I like to wait until they're real 
close, or even adjacent until letting off the blast.  (BTW, if you're 
using CL, the AC tradeoff for higher spell levels is really not worth 
it.  I think CL damage only increases by 2 points per level, and 
while you do get extra bolts, you probably also get extra gaps!).

I generally follow the same clearing pattern you describe, although 
in Hell I tend to clear it quadrant by quadrant because of the 
generally limited access between quadrants.  It's easy to detect the 
quadrants because of the X and Y symmetry.

I don't use guardians anymore.  They're potentially useful at lower 
levels or if you are playing the lightly-armored mage, but they only 
shoot firebolts and take too long to kill monsters that a few 
fireballs can polish off in seconds.  Of course, the latter route 
requires you to expose yourself to greater risk, but guardians can 
easily &#34;wake up&#34; a horde and cause them to descend on you en 
masse!

Once again, good job!

What spells are left?

&#62; 1. At least I think we are on 107 now. I can't remember. Anyway, I 
&#62; discovered a useful tactic with chain lightning last night in 
&#62; nightmare/hell that I thought was worth relating. Consider:
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; ########        ############     ##########
&#62;        #        #3        4#     #        #
&#62;        #        #          #     #        #

&#62;        #        #  m m  m  #     #        #
&#62;        #        #5   m  m 6#     #        #
&#62;   ################    ###############  #####
&#62; 1                   p             2
&#62; ############################################
&#62; 
&#62; Player, p, is adventuring and clearing a level. The player is using a 
&#62; spiral clear pattern, where he does the outermost rooms first and 
&#62; works his way inward. If the player is clearing from west to east and 
&#62; came from 1, he should teleport to 3 and chain the room clear of 
&#62; mobs, m. If he is clearing from east to west and has come from 2, he 
&#62; should teleport to 4 and chain.
&#62; 
&#62; This is very effective against flankers (balrog, goatmen) and 
&#62; zigzaggers (Drakes). Balrog like to flank, and by porting to a corner 
&#62; and chaining, you limit their range of motion to a 90degree arc about 
&#62; the corner, and increase your odds of hitting them considerably. If 
&#62; you stand in the middle of the room, balrog will flank and run around 
&#62; a full 360degrees about your position, reducing your odds of hitting. 
&#62; Even backing up against the wall reduces their motion to a 180deg 
&#62; arc. For zigzaggers, sitting in the corner sets up bolts along the 
&#62; diagonal into which the zigzaggers move. 
&#62; 
&#62; By porting to the side of the room nearest the area you have already 
&#62; cleared, you insure that no bolts will target back into the wall (the 
&#62; west wall in the case of 3, east in the case of 4). Some may ask why 
&#62; not port to positions 5 or 6. Well the answer is that there is a 
&#62; large uncleared portion to the south in the center of the level, 
&#62; where your bolts will target unseen mobs behind walls (credit Zamp 
&#62; with the discovery of chain targeting mobs behind walls).
&#62; 
&#62; I have found this method of chaining to be far more effective than 
&#62; porting in than out back to p and chaining. Balrog and drakes used to 
&#62; be difficult, now they drop in droves. Another plus is everything 
&#62; dies in the room making finding that dropped ring a lot easier. If  
&#62; you are in a hall and balrog are chasing you, lead them into a room 
&#62; and find your corner to chain them.
&#62; 
&#62; In regards to clear patterns, try this
&#62; 
&#62; 1     2      3  Start in a corner of the level. Here I start in the
&#62;                 NW corner, although any corner will do. Then clear
&#62;                 the mid wall (2) and next corner (3), until you
&#62; 8     9      4  have the perimeter cleared (8). Repeat on inner rooms.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; 7     5      6
&#62; 
&#62; 2. Fireball levels are levels where you have lightning immune 
&#62; creatures and fire vulnerables. I have had some more experiences here 
&#62; that may be of value. I used to be of the opinion that stone + 
&#62; fireball was the mana effective way to go for hell/hell and nightmare 
&#62; hell. Recently I have taken a liking to guardian + fireball. I have 
&#62; guardian up at a high enough level now where the damage from a single 
&#62; hit puts a creature in stun. I have found that setting a few 
&#62; guardians up slows the charge of the creatures, and helps you target 
&#62; creatures better with fireball. Many times they will be trapped in 
&#62; stun by the guardian and you can pop them with fireball. Guardian 
&#62; also has the flushing/lighting/scouting benefits as well. I also have 
&#62; a mindcry now, and 69 charges last a nice long time. I think the need 
&#62; to stone really depends alot on whether you are a Naj plate wizard or 
&#62; whether you like blessed or better full plate. One of my wizards is 
&#62; the armor type, and illusion weavers and such cant hit him even on 
&#62; hell settings (210 ac), where the other one likes the Naj plate and 
&#62; spell adders and hidden/illusion weavers are a serious threat.
&#62; 
&#62; 3. An interesting note on guardian is that the spell does seem to 
&#62; hurt your coop player. I was grouped with a rogue, and we had 
&#62; illusion weavers. The weavers would show up on the rogue or me, and 
&#62; the guardians would hit the rogue a lot. It seems that if you are 
&#62; close to a guardian, and in a line of fire between it and its target, 
&#62; you will get hit (although the guardian does not seem to hit me). Has 
&#62; anyone else noticed this? The rogue was not to pleased with my 
&#62; guardians killing her a couple times.
