&#62; &#62; Yesterday is the luckiest day since I've played Diablo. I've found 3 
&#62; &#62; unique items in a solo normal/hell, they're a royal circlet, a 
&#62; &#62; windforce and a naj's light plate. Sure, my lv30 rouge equiped them 
&#62; &#62; all immediately. After that I could make a good trip to kill Diablo 
&#62; &#62; in nightmare/hell. Today I played hell difficulty and planned to get 
&#62; &#62; a third dot for my rouge. Unfortunately, my rouge was killed by those 
&#62; &#62; f...... advocates in lv15. I immediately press esc and was about to 
&#62; &#62; choose &#34;restart in town&#34;, but, somehow, I selected &#34;new 
&#62; &#62; game&#34;! When I realized, it's too late and I could do nothing. 
&#62; &#62; That's how I lost all my stuff: a royal circlet, a naj's light plate, 
&#62; &#62; a wind force, an obsidian ring of heaven, an obsidian amulet of 
&#62; &#62; giant, and a ring of heaven. I'm exhasted to think that I have to 
&#62; &#62; spend a loooong time to search for such good items again. And now my 
&#62; &#62; rouge has only some not identified junks! What should I do? Any 
&#62; &#62; suggestions, or at least some words to cheer me up?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Thanks,

&#62; Hi !  I know how you feel.  I have had this game since it came
&#62; out and have played the same character since the start.  
&#62; Treasure hunting is my favorite activity so you can imagine the
&#62; stuff I had, it was awesome.  I recently lost it all playing
&#62; hell/hell solo and then lost all my awesome backup equipment
&#62; trying to recover my main stuff.  I was pretty devastated at
&#62; first but decided I would try to replace it.  I have now found
&#62; some really good equipment and have had a lot of fun doing it.
&#62; So dont let it get you down, just go back out and find some more
&#62; good stuff.  You did it once you can do it again !
&#62; Good luck !

It seems like we both had the same situation, but actually it's not. 
Well, I just wanna tell you that in my case it's because of my 
stupidness to lose all my stuff. If you read my post again carefully, 
you'll see how I lost them. I shouldn't have chosen the damn &#34;new 
game&#34;, my action was just faster than my thought. That's why I 
felt so depressed at first.

Yeah, it's right as you said, I did it once and I'll do it again.

Thanks,

Tee, incharge of Jin-A, lv30 rouge.</pre>
