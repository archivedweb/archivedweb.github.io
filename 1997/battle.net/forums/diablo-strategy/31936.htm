<pre>&#62; &#62; Code,
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      After reading your post here, I figured you
&#62; &#62; are the person to ask. Does that so called
&#62; &#62; &#34;cow-level&#34; really exist?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;      Silly question, I fear. But I really want to
&#62; &#62; know the truth about that rumor.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;                        - Dizzy


To Dizzy: DarkSniper is  correct. I *CAN* verify that there is no cow 
level because of the fact I have seen virtually every creature file 
there is on the CD, there is no animation of the &#34;cows&#34; 
walking or fighting.


To DarkSniper:

I'm not avoiding ya, I just have been really busy and wanted to 
answer some of the other replies that I have seen. (2 posts per 2 
hours is hard to work with as you know).

&#62;now call me stubborn, but i have my principals. in ur bury the 
hacket 
&#62;post, u only stated stuff about the debate. which as i stated i 
dont 
&#62;mind. but its ur statement that claims i m trying to take the 
channel 
&#62;over that really pissed me off. now if u would like to respond 
to 
&#62;that, it will be appreciated.

It seemed that way to me because of your &#34;run off the 
cheaters&#34; style of answering some of the &#34;how do I cheat&#34; 
posts. I see them having rights to post here without getting severly 
flamed. Anyway I will officially &#34;retract&#34; my statement about 
you &#34;trying to take over the channel&#34;. I believe it's not 
your intent, you just have a very open &#34;style&#34; that takes 
some getting use to. I apologize.

I do not hate you. I don't really &#34;dis-like&#34; you. I like that 
you strive to be as legit as possible. I only wish you were slightly 
more tolerant of other peoples views. BTW, I still think back to our 
little game we had.... it was fun.
