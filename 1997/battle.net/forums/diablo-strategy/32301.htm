&#62;  First off, that was not a &#34;flame.&#34; It was a legitimate 
&#62; attempt to shed a little light on the subject from my perspective.  
&#62; Also, your assumption that all of the post was in reply to one of 
&#62; YOUR earlier posts was not only a little vain, but incorrect.  I saw 
&#62; many, many, many posts regarding the Godly dilemma, and one said that 
&#62; godly plate did not exist, and one that said gpow could not be 
&#62; bought.  Both of those are WRONG, which I think you'll agree with. 
&#62;  You seem to be someone who has a good understanding of this game, 
&#62; and who doesn't mind helping others out, based on your performace in 
&#62; this forum.  I hold the utmost respect for anyone who, like myself, 
&#62; plays this game somewhat seriously, has a good time, and wants others 
&#62; to as well.  
&#62;  Anyway-here's what I'm saying. Hopefully this time it will be more 
&#62; clear. 
&#62; 
&#62; 1) Godly Plate of the Whale exists in multiplayer. I was offered 
&#62; Breast style from Wirt, and a resonably low cost (120k, i think).
&#62; 2) A friend of mine who is very trustworth claims to have found Godly 
&#62; Full Plate of the Ages in a barrel.  I see no reason not to believe 
&#62; him, since the incident happened early in Diablo (like late Jan.), 
&#62; although I have no proof that it did actually occur.
&#62; 3) Blizzard support is retarded (no offense guys, but get on the ball 
&#62; and stop bullshitting to shut us up. Pardon my French).  King's bows 
&#62; exist, but are very rare.  GFP exists, but is very rare.  Um...DUH? I 
&#62; though you found them every time you killed a fallen one...Either 
&#62; give some concrete answers, or leave us in the dark.  
&#62; 4) I have spent WAY too much time playing this game.
&#62; 
&#62; No hard feelings
