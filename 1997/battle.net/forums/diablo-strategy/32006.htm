<pre>Here are my opinions on cheating.  I appreciate any feedback that you 
may have to offer, so here goes:

1.)  Altering your character in any way, by use of ecternal programs, 
or any other methods IS cheating.  (Example:  Raising exp, gold, 
stats, spell levels, adding items, adding spells, etc...)

2.)  Backing up/restoring multiplayer characters is NOT cheating.  I 
am not going to use that old &#34;system crash&#34; excuse either.  
In single player Daiblo, when you get yer ass whupped up on by some 
demons, you can just restore from your last save, and multiplayer 
should be no different, especially with the added risks of pkillers, 
and the like.  Whilst I do agree that you must beware of such 
dangers, and protect yourself, that is not always enough, therefore, 
backups/restores, should be used to ensure your safety.

3.)  In multiplayer games high-level players giving things to lower 
level players is legitimate ONLY if what is given to them is normally 
obtainable by the lower level character, for example, if a 20th level 
Rouge gives a few healing potions to a level 5 Warrior, that is fine, 
but giving something that the lower level character would not have 
access to until farther in the game IS cheating.  I am sick and tired 
of seeing low-level characters (level 1-12) having Godly plates, 
Obsidian rings, Dragon amulets, and King's swords.  These items are 
EXTREMELY rare, and are not legitimately found until much later in 
the game, not to mention that the vast majority of them are hacked 
anyway.  I am on Battle Net all of the time, and I see it every day, 
level 1-12 characters with the best equipment in the game, and it 
makes me sick, and almost want to go into convulsions every time I 
see it.

4.)  Dupping IS cheating, under any circumstances.  If people didn't 
dupe, then the problem expressed in #3 above would not be so bad.  If 
King's swords, and other rare equipment, were as rare as they should 
be, they NOBODY would be giving them away.

5.)  Using a program, such as one of the trainers that is out there, 
to grant immunity to other player's attacks is NOT cheating, unless 
participating in a duel, of coarse.  Reason being, with all of the 
PKers out there, one MUST protect oneself.  I know TONS of people 
disagree with this, but, it is an easy solution, to a BIG problem 
like PKers.

6.)  Having other players buy items for you (from Griswald, Wirt, or 
Adria) is NOT cheating PROVIDING that they are the same level as you, 
or damn near the same level, and also providing that you have the 
required amount of gold.

7.)  It is not cheating to re-start a game, just to see if Griswald, 
Wirt, or Adria have and rare items.

8.)  It is NOT cheating to use programs that can show you other 
players stats.  If you are not cheating yourself, then you should 
have no reason why you would mind someone else viewing your stats, 
unless you are cheating, and have all 255, or something.

9.)  It is NOT cheating to use portals to grant a lower level player 
access to a deep part of the labyrinth that they would otherwise be 
unable to visit, whilst they would have access to equipment that is 
&#34;before their time&#34;, they would surely get their ass whupped 
by the harder demons that lurk at the lower levels of the labyrinth, 
so everything equals out in the end.

10.)  It IS cheating to use teleport in town, or any other 
&#34;illegal&#34; spells, that you would not normally be able to cast 
in town.

11.)  Is it cheating for one character to give another one some gold? 
 Well, it depends.  If it is only a few hundred or so, then NO, it is 
not.  If however, it is piles of 5,000, then YES, that is definately 
cheating.

I appreciate your time and efforts of reading this, and the possible 
posting of a reply.  I am in no way, shape, or form, out to shed dis-
respect onto anyone, or offend anyone, and I hope that I have not 
done so.  I understand that everyone has their own views, and 
opinions about this subject, and that is the purpose of this.  To 
find out what people think.  Thank you for your time and effort.

-Sincerely
