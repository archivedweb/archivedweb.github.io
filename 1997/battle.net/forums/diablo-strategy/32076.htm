<pre>If used properly, the guardian spell should not cause a problem
with the rogue or warrior.

The tatic I sometimes use (if I'm sure most of the monsters in the
room are not fire immune) is to flood the room with guardian. My
rogue and warrior buddies would stand by the door (not in front
of the door where firebolts may come out) and ambush anything
that comes out.

This works great for those rooms that are full of witches (except
soul burner). Use enough guardians and none of them will leave
the room alive.

This also works great in the Laz chamber. Only one (or may both)
of the unique witches are immune to fire and will crawl out of the
room. All the advocates and Laz can be killed if there are enough
guardians.
Of course, guardian should not be used in the same room the
characters are in. It's too much confusion.

My favorite staff is the Minecry. With 69 charges, I can go
guardian-happy and save my mana for mana shield. The best
part is it cost less than 1000 gp to recharge the staff.

Another thing, in a big room, the guardian usually does not
activate all the monsters in the area. It only shoots at monsters
that the guardian can see. And it doesn't miss often.

I hope this cast a new light on the guardian spell.

&#62; &#62; 3. An interesting note on guardian is that the spell does seem to 
&#62; &#62; hurt your coop player. I was grouped with a rogue, and we had 
&#62; &#62; illusion weavers. The weavers would show up on the rogue or me, and 
&#62; &#62; the guardians would hit the rogue a lot. It seems that if you are 
&#62; &#62; close to a guardian, and in a line of fire between it and its target, 
&#62; &#62; you will get hit (although the guardian does not seem to hit me). Has 
&#62; &#62; anyone else noticed this? The rogue was not to pleased with my 
&#62; &#62; guardians killing her a couple times.
&#62; &#62;

&#62; 
&#62; Guardians are very hard on rogues.  Not only do we get
&#62; hit by their fireballs (both directly and &#34;splash&#34; damage it 
&#62; seems),
&#62; but three or four can fill the screen with so much moving stuff
&#62; we can't see to aim (and _nobody_ likes that! :-) and worst of
&#62; all, every blooming critter in this room and all surrounding
&#62; rooms comes charging out at you all at once.  Then Mr. Hotshot
&#62; mage panicks and starts making like Nintendo Kid with the fire
&#62; button set for Chain Lightning.  
&#62; 
&#62; Great.  Now your 150-200 hp lvl 30+ rogue has lightning, 
&#62; fireballs, _and_ monsters beating on her simultaneously, plus 
&#62; the screen is so cluttered she can't see what's going on.  I do 
&#62; not find this to be a very comfortable (or pleasant) situation 
&#62; to be in.  My mage and I had several intense discussions 
&#62; about this strategy before I was able to convince him that
&#62; this was a strategy best left for solo play.
