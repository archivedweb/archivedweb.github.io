<pre>On Mon Jul 14 20:57, Lorax wrote:
&#62; I have long been reading this forum, and the sheer volume of posts on 
&#62; the subject of &#34;cheating vs. legit&#34; in Diablo never ceases to 
&#62; amaze and annoy me.  It seems that the land of Tristram has been 
&#62; divided into two distinct sects, cheaters and legit players.  I, 
&#62; however, believe that the distinction is not as clear as many would 
&#62; like to think.  This post details my thoughts on the subject.  Call 
&#62; it an opinion, call it a vent, call it what you will.  
&#62; 
&#62; First, let us examine the typical &#34;cheater.&#34;  What drives a 
&#62; person to cheating?  Maybe frustration with their inability to play 
&#62; well.  Maybe a need to dominate others to boost their ego.  Or 
&#62; perhaps just boredom with the game.  Whatever the reason, they have 
&#62; chosen to alter the game for themselves and/or others.  Their methods 
&#62; are many.  Duping, hacking items, godmode, ghostmode, inflating their 
&#62; attributes or spells; just to name a few.  Some are good-natured.  
&#62; Some are malevolent and rampant pk's.  They are the bane of the 
&#62; &#34;legit&#34; player.
&#62; 
&#62; The typical &#34;legit&#34; player is the &#34;anti-cheater.&#34;  
&#62; They detest duping, hacks and other &#34;impure&#34; methods of play. 
&#62;  To them, cheaters have ruined the game as it was intended.  They 
&#62; often consider themselves above the cheater, and are generous with 
&#62; flames that state the fact.  Some have even dedicated themselves to 
&#62; &#34;rescuing&#34; newbies from the pitfall of cheating.  Many join 
&#62; guilds where they can play legit games with their legit friends.  
&#62; They are often thought of as the &#34;good guys&#34; of battlenet.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, at first inspection, these two groups may seem all-inclusive.  
&#62; But I propose that there is a third group lost somewhere in between.  
&#62; They are less apparent, but are possibly the greatest in number.  We 
&#62; have sometimes seen glimpses of these players in posts here titled, 
&#62; &#34;Is this cheating?&#34;, etc.  They are players who selectively 
&#62; do things that other players may consider cheating.  I place myself 
&#62; in this middle group, and I would argue that most people who claim to 
&#62; be &#34;legit&#34; belong here, too.
&#62; 
&#62; As an example, I will use a recent post from this forum.  
&#62; [Disclaimer:  The use of this individual as an example does not imply 
&#62; that I am picking on him, and does not require a flame in return.  :-
&#62; )]  The poster claims outright to be &#34;legit.&#34;  He explains 
&#62; that he recently convinced a newbie to cast off cheating and join him 
&#62; in legitimacy.  As part of this, he instructed the newbie not to 
&#62; accept duped or hacked items.  The two played together, but the 
&#62; newbie played the church while the poster went to hell.  The poster 
&#62; returns with items (rings and armor) from hell and gives them to the 
&#62; newbie to help him stay alive in the catacombs.  Now, I would claim 
&#62; that the newbie's acceptance of these items jeopardizes his 
&#62; reputation as a &#34;legit&#34; player.  Would he have gotten these 
&#62; items on his own at his level?  Mind you, I'm not saying this is 
&#62; WRONG.  In fact, I admire the poster's intentions.  I'm just saying 
&#62; that it isn't (in my opinion) 100&#37; &#34;pure.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; But on to the point.  I see legitimacy, not as a divergent issue, but 
&#62; as a CONTINUUM.  Put simply, it is not a black and white issue.  It 
&#62; is an expansive range of shades of gray.  At one end is the 
&#62; &#34;extreme cheater&#34; who uses every hack in the book.  At the 
&#62; other end is the &#34;true legit.&#34;  In my opinion this is one who 
&#62; does not use any cheats/hacks/accessory programs, does not dupe, and 
&#62; does not use anything that he does not kill or buy himself.  Now I'm 
&#62; sure that many of you are thinking, &#34;That's ridiculous.  Your 
&#62; standards for a 'true legit' are too high.&#34;  In response, I would 
&#62; say that it's supposed to be.  It's an extreme, the end of the 
&#62; continuum.  There is no implication, on my part, that you should even 
&#62; TRY to be a &#34;true legit.&#34;  
&#62; 
&#62; I propose the following examples to illustrate this idea. They are 
&#62; roughly ranked in order from most legit to least legit.  [Disclaimer 
&#62; #2:  This list is not intended to be all inclusive, nor is the order 
&#62; of ranking necessarily &#34;gospel.&#34;]
&#62; 
&#62; *  &#34;True legit.&#34;
&#62; *  Backing up characters in case of system crashes.
&#62; *  Taking legit items from other players.
&#62; *  Taking legit items from higher level players.
&#62; *  Using hacks for protection against cheating pk's.
&#62; *  Creating, using, giving, and taking duped items.
&#62; *  Creating, using, giving, taking, and duping hacked items.
&#62; *  Hacking stats, spells, etc.
&#62; *  Godmode, etc.
&#62; *  &#34;Extreme cheater.&#34;
&#62;   
&#62; And now, my second point (this is the venting part).  The legitimacy 
&#62; continuum is in no way related to being good or bad.  Being a cheater 
&#62; doesn't necessarily make you BAD.  And being &#34;legit&#34; 
&#62; certainly doesn't make you better than everyone else.  I don't know 
&#62; which is worse, pk'ing cheaters who ruin games, or so-called 
&#62; &#34;legits&#34; on their high horse throwing around flames.  For 
&#62; example, how many times have I heard the &#34;press Alt-F4 to 
&#62; dupe&#34; line, or, even worse, attempts to try to get cheaters to 
&#62; reformat their hard drives?  If, as a &#34;legit&#34;, you really 
&#62; want to be a &#34;good guy&#34;, throwing around childish insults and 
&#62; being downright destructive is not the way.  Don't play with people 
&#62; if you don't approve of their place in the continuum.  But let them 
&#62; play the way they want.  Everyone (well, almost) has payed for the 
&#62; game, just like everyone else.  And everyone has the right to enjoy 
&#62; the game however they wish. 
&#62; 
&#62; As an attempt at setting a good example, I'll relate a recent 
&#62; experience of mine.  I started a public game on battlenet.  I almost 
&#62; always begin a night on battlenet in a public game, usually titled 
&#62; &#34;TheTruffulaGrove.pureonlyplease&#34; (feel free to drop in 
&#62; sometime if you want.)  Anyway, I was playing with my warrior, and I 
&#62; was soon joined by a rogue who was near the same level as I.  I went 
&#62; to town to meet her, and she claimed to be &#34;legit&#34;.  I 
&#62; noticed, however, that her hit points seemed a little high.  &#34;Oh, 
&#62; well,&#34; I thought, &#34;we'll give it a try.&#34;  We went to the 
&#62; catacombs, and played fairly well together.  She was considerate, and 
&#62; cooperative.  I was enjoying myself.  But quite suddenly, I wasn't 
&#62; having much fun.  I looked at my health, and I was almost dead.  She 
&#62; had accidentally shot me with ONE arrow, and it almost killed me.  I 
&#62; popped open a portal, and jumped in.  She said, &#34;what are you 
&#62; doing?&#34;  I told her, &#34;your damage is just too high, you 
&#62; almost killed me with one shot.&#34;  She assured me that she was 
&#62; &#34;legit&#34; ... she had just gotten some good items from a 
&#62; friend.  I explained that I was sorry, but I just wasn't comfortable 
&#62; playing with her.  I thanked her for playing with me, bid her good 
&#62; venturing, and left to start a new game, 
&#62; &#34;TheTruffulaGrove2.pureonlypleas&#34;.  Now maybe she was using 
&#62; hacked equipment.  Maybe not.  It didn't matter.  There was no need 
&#62; to accuse, there was no need to preach.  The very next game, I met 
&#62; &#34;Rook&#34;, a mage with a gaming attitude similar to mine.  We 
&#62; played well together, but were soon pk'ed by an obvious cheater :-(.  
&#62; We didn't have to flame him.  We simply quietly moved on to a private 
&#62; game, and had a great time playing together for the rest of the 
&#62; evening.
&#62; 
&#62; Now, to sum up this long story, it was a normal night on battlenet.  
&#62; I met a polite &#34;cheater&#34;, I met an impolite 
&#62; &#34;cheater&#34;, and I met a polite &#34;legit&#34;.  I didn't 
&#62; flame, I didn't judge.  I simply played with the person I was 
&#62; comfortable with, and had a good time.
&#62; 
&#62; When I first decided to write this post, the forum was overrun with 
&#62; people preaching about the evils of cheating, flaming any cheater who 
&#62; asked for help.  Today, though, I noticed several posts from people 
&#62; who seem to have the &#34;live and let live&#34; attitude that I try 
&#62; to keep.  (Lestat, Code Myster, and Saint Michael, just to name a 
&#62; few.)  They make this post a little like old news, but I'm glad to 
&#62; see them.  I truly believe that if more people followed this way of 
&#62; thinking, battlenet would be a better place.
&#62; 
&#62; You might want to know where I believe I fit into the continuum.  On 
&#62; a scale from 0-10 (why does everyone always leave out 0?), with 0 
&#62; being the &#34;extreme cheater&#34;, and 10 being the &#34;true 
&#62; legit&#34;, I would rank myself at 8 or 9.  In the past, I used the 
&#62; trainer to see ghosts, but recently ditched it after I noticed my 
&#62; warrior's spell levels jumped to 16 for no apparent reason.  (I had 
&#62; to set all spells to level 0 and start my book hunt over to feel 
&#62; comfortable with myself).  I back up my characters regularly and 
&#62; restore them when I lose items to server problems or cheating (but 
&#62; not legit) mk's.  I have accepted items from a friend who I play with 
&#62; often who is near the same level as I.  Otherwise, I'd say I'm pure.  
&#62; Am I a cheater?  Am I legit? ... Does it matter?  I would argue that 
&#62; the answer to all three questions  is &#34;no.&#34;
&#62; 
&#62; Finally, I'd like to thank you for you patience , if you're still 
&#62; reading :-).  I realize this post is VERY long (I might have a record 
&#62; here), but this stuff has been welling up inside me for a long time, 
&#62; and finally getting it out feels good.  I realize that this post may 
&#62; offend some people.  Please know that this is not my intention.  I 
&#62; also realize that this post will soon be lost to that great bit-
&#62; bucket in the sky.  Cheating pk's will continue to ruin the fun for 
&#62; others.  &#34;Legits&#34; on their high horses will flame away.  I 
&#62; only hope that I have made you think for a moment about the value of 
&#62; tolerance.
&#62; 
&#62; So, in conclusion, I think this &#34;legit vs. cheater&#34; argument 
&#62; is way out of hand.  Legitimacy is a continuum, not a finite state.  
&#62; In fact, many players who claim to be &#34;legit&#34; are not 
&#62; completely pure.  My advice to you ... Find a place in the continuum 
&#62; where you are comfortable playing, play with people who you are 
&#62; comfortable with,  and do not judge others for their choice.
