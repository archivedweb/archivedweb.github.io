&#62; With that said, you seem to have a good sense of humor.  It could be 
&#62; that I like your attitude.  I'll have to five it some more thought 
&#62; and let you know.
&#62; 
&#62; Try answering some of the posts instead of making blanket statements 
&#62; like &#34;I can answer all questions that can be asked......&#34;  
&#62; These posts of yours are going to get you ignored and/or flamed. (see 
&#62; the responses below to your earlier posts)
&#62; 
&#62; You know anything about a bug with the Nova spell?

&#62; &#62; &#62; Your site is slow and I was not willing to wait for it to load.  
&#62; &#62; &#62; Therefore, I was not able to find the answer to my question.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Sorry That My Site Is Slow I'll Fix It Later
&#62; &#62;  
&#62; &#62; &#62; I have two mage characters and a rogue.  Is this good??????
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I think thats pretty cool your picking all of the ranged characters 
&#62; &#62; and they are more fun to use. But, I'm wondering: What are the stats 
&#62; &#62; of each character, What Spells Does Each Character Have, What Floor 
&#62; &#62; Are They On.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;  I have 4(3 Single Players And 1 Multi) characters One Warrior, 2 
&#62; &#62; Rouge, and 1 Sorcerer, I already beat the game with each character so 
&#62; &#62; I play multiplayer on Battle.Net.
&#62; &#62; &#62; Not too complicated for you, is it???
&#62; &#62; Nope
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Ultrabrian
I know i was being made fun of so I admit i wasn't &#34;The 
Expert&#34;

The reason I got &#34;flamed&#34; is because I said I was an expert, 
and people didn't think so. So thats Why I admit that i'm not an 
expert, i'm just willing to help anyone with a question not to brag 
or anything.

Sorry I don't know anything about the nova
