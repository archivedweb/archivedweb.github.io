&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62;  If you want to participate in this survey, please answer the 
&#62; questions *BEFORE* you read other peoples replies (in order to 
&#62; preserve answers). I want each of your opinions.
&#62; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; This is a simple survey of what people concider is &#34;cheating&#34; 
&#62; or not. Please answer with a simple Yes or No and *WHY* you feel it 
&#62; is or is not, cheating.
  Sorry, Code; some of these will have to be a &#34;depends&#34; 
answer, some I think are cheating only under certain circumstances.
     ********note--when you say &#34;higher level&#34; and &#34;lower 
level,&#34; I'm assuming there is a significant difference here--a 
good 8-10 levels!
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Gold from another player?
  Depends.  If you're playing a coop game and you've decided to share
you loot, then no, it's not.  If the char's levels are off by, say,
more than 7 or so, I think it is cheating to give a lower level char.
large amounts of gold (more than 1000-1500?  All relative . . .)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to accept Items from a higher char?
  Yes (if the item is inordinately powerful for your current level).
A level 1 character has no business having zodiacs, or even heavens
or moon.  When was the last time you found anything that bettered 
even one attribute more than 5-10 points in normal church?  Characters
should not be given items they could not normally get on their own.
This would be circumventing the process of building the character; it 
would already be built, and at no risk!

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars buy items for you?
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to have higher level chars give lower level chars 
&#62; elixers?
  Yes on both, for the same reasons.  Higher level characters have 
access to items (found and sold) and gold significantly above what 
lower level characters can get thier hands on.  See above answer.
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to clear levels for lower players?
  Yes-pretty much the same as the above two answers.  If the lower 
level character wants the goodies, he/she should have to work to 
build  enough power to get into the deeper levels and EARN them (or 
kill enough to get the $ to buy them!)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, 
&#62; Adria or Griz for items?
   No--I don't see this as cheating.  To me, it's almost exactly the 
same as my 29th level fighter to make a hell-run just for items (there
is relatively little risk to my character).  You're staying within
the parameters of the game design, and not depending on another higher
level player, or any cheats/hacks, etc.  If you're willing to take
the time to restart new games and walk all that way, go for it.  
Besides, there's never any guarantee that anyone will have any 
worthwhile items, anyway.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
   Technically, I would have to say yes.  Normally, you cannot check 
another's stats.  However, if I had this program, I would probably use
it, to protect myself from obvious cheaters/hackers.  It's hard to
answer this one without any context attatched to it--it's like 
asking, is it illegal for a cop to search your car?  It's not illegal 
if he has probable cause, but it is illegal for him to just 
indiscriminantly force you to open your trunk, just because.  If I'm 
checking your stats to see if you are a cheater, because I want a 
legit game, I think that's not &#34;cheating.&#34;  If I'm trying to 
find a character weaker than mine in order to PK/MK, that IS 
cheating:  I'm looking for an unfair advantage that I wouldn't 
normally get in the game.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to allow lower players to portal into areas they 
&#62; could not regularly access?
   yes--see above answers re:  low level access to high level stuff.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra 
&#62; items?
  No (assuming all items are legit!).  If you want to spend your time
transferring items from &#34;storage,&#34; fine.  Anyone else can do 
this, too, so no one gains an unfair advantage.

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
  I hope not-I've done this!!  Seriously, as long as the items are 
not out of line (see above), I don't think this is cheating.  (I can 
see how it could be considered cheating:  the recieving CHARACTER did 
not participate in any of the risk to get the item, even though the 
PLAYER did.)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Pk with the Nova spell?
  hey, use what you got.  I wouldn't like it if it happened to me.
It's cheasy, but it's not cheating.
&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Portal Kill someone?
  I don't know how this is done--sorry, too ignerint to answer!  :-(

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to Teleport in town?
  Touchy one.  I would have to say yes.  Even though the act of town
teleportation is harmless to any other players, it is still something 
that you normally cannot do.  You have to use a hack in order to do 
this; if you want to continually check Griz, Adrai, and Wirtless, 
then, as far as I see it, you have to suck it up and hoof it.  (that 
may be one of the reasons they're so far apart, to discourage 
repeated visits!! hmmmmmmm . . .)

&#62; #). Is it Cheating to backup chars against system crashes?
   No.  If that is the sole reason for backups, no way is it cheating.
In every other game I know (including solo Diablo) you can save.  How
many of us do NOT save just before a critical moment in ANY game (civ,
DOOM/Quake, Diablo solo-for those who still play it--name any other)
in case we screw up?  Is THAT cheating . . .????

&#62; Anwer honestly! I'll post later with my views on the above later 
&#62; today.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;               -=/ Code Myster /=-

Well, that's my $0.02, for what it's worth (about two cents, right?)

fight the good fight,
