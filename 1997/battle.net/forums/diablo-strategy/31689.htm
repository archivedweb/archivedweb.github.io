<pre>Code Myster,

First of all, I can't believe the volume of replies here!  Wow, it 
sure was hard to refrain from reading them before responding.  But I 
did as you suggested, so here's my (unaffected) opinion.

I have responded to each one by cutting and pasting it here, and 
telling whether or not I think it's cheating, and then telling 
whether or not I do (or have done) it.


accept Gold from another player?
  Not cheating.
    I have done it, but only with my high level character.
    At a certain point, there's no difficulty in finding a 
    lot of gold.  Then, it's just an inconvenience to have
    to go back to the dungeon when you are only 1000 or so 
    short of buying something.

accept Items from a higher char?
  Not cheating.
    I have only accepted items from a friend with whom I
    play modem games.  We are always within one level of 
    each other, however.  I have never (and won't) accept
    items from any character that is a lot higher.

have higher level chars buy items for you?
  Not cheating.
    Same as above.

have higher level chars give lower level chars elixers?
  Not cheating.
    Similarly, only from that one friend.  Again, we are 
    always within one level of each other.  In this case,
    would both buy elixers as they came available, and we 
    would share them.

clear levels for lower players?
  Not cheating.
    Have not.

Start games with only the intent to check Wirt, Adria or Griz for 
items?
  Not cheating. 
    Have, but only occasionally.  Never for hours on end.

use Deye in chat to look at other peoples stats?
  Cheating.  
    Do it all the time.

allow lower players to portal into areas they could not regularly 
access?
  Not cheating.  
    Have.

create chars whos only purpose is to hold extra items?
  Not cheating.
    Have in the past, but have found that there's really 
    no point in it.

transfer items found by 1 char to another char?
  Not cheating.
    Have in the past, but not with any of my current 
    characters.

Pk with the Nova spell?
  (A legit nova spell?)  Not cheating.
    Have never pk'ed.

Portal Kill someone?
  I'm not familiar with this one.  Anyone care to explain it?

Teleport in town?
  Cheating.
    Have done it in the past, but I no longer use the 
    trainer for anything.  (I have personally seen that 
    it can do some weird things.)

backup chars against system crashes?
  Not cheating.
    Do it all the time. 


Whew!  That was a lot of replying.  I hope you read it.  :-)
It's kind of interesting that the two things that I say are cheating, 
I have done.  Maybe I'm a cheater!  Oh, no!  j/k

In my opinion, almost none of the things you mentioned are cheating.  
BUT, that does not mean that they are legit.  (You guys MUST be 
getting tired of my middle-of-the-road attitude.)  :-)  You know my 
feelings.  If it feels right to you, you're having fun, and not 
hurting anyone else, go for it.
