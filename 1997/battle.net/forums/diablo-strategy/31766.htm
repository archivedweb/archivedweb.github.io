<pre>&#62; Q.  What uniques do you think are the best for each character and are 
&#62; there (In your opinion) any &#34;non uniques&#34; better than those 
&#62; uniques?

Well, I've played a warrior for 2 games seriously, so I can't comment 
well on warrior items.

Rogues only lasted one game with me.  :)

So, here's what I in my not-so-humble opinion think of what is not 
100&#37; the best stuff for a mage.  However, unlike some people's 
posts, I'm not going to bring up godly plates, pairs of obsidian 
zodiacs, or anything else that anyone with less than 20 spare hours a 
day wouldn't have.  So, here's (realistically) what's great stuff for 
a mage.

Helm:  I've worn a thinking cap since I found my second one.  I 
traded away the first one in late January, when I was an extreme 
newbie.  (I found it off Leoric)

Armor:  For a power-orinted mage, without a doubt, go for Naj's Light 
Plate.  Level 20 fireballs roast just about anything.  :)  Other than 
that, some Awesome Full Plate is great.  Awesome plate of Sorcery or 
of Giants is better, but hey, take what you can get.  I prefer Naj's 
because then I don't have to worry about str requirements.

Weapon/Shield:  We're mages, we don't use king's swords, 
stormshields, or other crap like that.  I use one of two items.  The 
first, for solo use, is an Arch-Angel's staff of Wizardry.  Pretty 
spiffy.  :)  However, for co-op play, I bring out my AA staff of 
Resurrect.  (ummm, oops?  hehehehe)

With the Thinking Cap and Naj's Light Plate, you have 40&#37; resist 
all.  You should be able to find some Obsidian ring or amulet that's 
at least 35&#37; resist all.  If it's got a suffix, even better.  
Then, you can use the other slots for items that raise both mana AND 
magic.  Those are pretty uncommon, but definately worth keeping when 
found.  :)  If it comes between a Dragon's ring +60 mana or a Ring of 
Wizardry +29 magic, take the ring of wizardry, because some spells 
have damage based on your magic stat, which is (at times) worth the 
less mana.  If you can't decide, keep both.  Switch between them, and 
see which works best for you.

Now, you have to realize, this isn't a 100&#37; guaranteed to work 
method.  However, I've been using it, and so far, I'm up to level 46 
LEGIT, with over 600 million experience.  Sounds better though if I 
say that I've got .6 BILLION experience.  hehehehe.
