&#62; 
&#62; You don't have to be a rogue to identify which chests  are trapped.  
&#62; There are actually two types of traps, those that are sprung right 
&#62; from the chest itself and those that come flying out of the wall.  If 
&#62; the former, you are out of luck, only a rogue can figure out whether 
&#62; its trapped or not.  The latter kind of chest, however can be 
&#62; detected and avoided by any class.  Before opening a chest look at 
&#62; all walls that surround the chest.  If you see a dark circle on the 
&#62; wall, the chest is trapped.  Avoiding the trap is easy.  
&#62;

&#62; The hole will always be placed one square away from the chest.  
&#62; (above, hole = 0 and Chest =C, the hole is one column to the right of 
&#62; the Chest.)  Standing in any of the X locations to open the chest, 
&#62; are your best bets at remaining safe.   Standing in any of the B(ad) 
&#62; locations will get you toasted/skewered.
&#62; 

This is a good tip.  Took me a while to notice it myself.  For a long 
time I thought the hole in the wall appeared when the trap was 
sprung, go figure. *shrug*

&#62; 
&#62; By the way, has anyone ever been killed by their own Golem?  I was 
&#62; playing my new mage yesterday and walked into a Golem swing.  Killed 
&#62; me right off (you don't lose your equipment, BTW) and then the Golem 
&#62; died when I restarted.....Do you think he was committing suicide?

I usually play solo so I do not have much experience in co-op gaming. 
 This may be old news to most of you but it was new to me when it 
happened.  I was playing my rogue with a mage friend and we both cast 
Golem at the same time.  They apparently didn't like each other and 
started to fight.  His killed mine because his was stronger (sniff).  
We did it a second time because we thought it was funny.  Same result.
