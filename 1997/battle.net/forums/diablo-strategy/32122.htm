<pre>I was the one who regards crashes as part of the history. I am no 
role playing purist. At best when I am well rested and have a good 
beer in hand I might spew a few in character lines. Roleplaying is a 
lot of work after all...

When I look back on a character, some of my most memorable instances 
have been when I have had to rebuild from scratch. With the original 
Lok, I rebuilt twice from scratch after intractable stairs deaths. 
Each time I came out stronger than I was before, and with a 
completely different armament approach to the game. The game had a 
new face and a new feel.

I have lost items to bugs. I lost a nice unique from an accidental 
dupe (lots of clicking with inv window open). So? Its just an object. 
Objects come and go. It was fun while it lasted.

I have deleted and replayed this character once now. Its almost to 
the boring point now where a crash might actually be welcome. Levels 
25-30 are by far the most exciting levels for me.

I had a lot of game crashes, but never lost anything. I have had 
plenty of timeouts and just plain dumb forgetting to pick up stuff in 
town prior to quitting. I have never felt the need to backup or 
retrieve objects lost in this manner. When this stuff happens it just 
makes me want to play more and recover.

For me the challenge and addiction of the game is the persuit of 
power, not its use. Thats the heroic quest- the building of the hero. 
The reason I liked &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is that it focused on this 
development, the forging of the hero. The hero realized is the 
climatic end. The books thereafter held little interest for me. 

Dependence upon objects is the certain route to inferior play. Losing 
objects and starting over just makes you a better player. So for me 
out of character events get lumped in with in character events as my 
memory of a character, and I like the thought of the character being 
mortal with a remote, although possible chance of oblivion. I don't 
know, maybe it was mudding for years and topping out character after 
character only to find boredom as a reward.

So walk that tightrope without a net and feel the thrill of the 
moment. Backup cheats you of this experience.

&#62; BTW, I recently saw a post on this issue in which someone said they 
&#62; viewed the hard disk crash, file corruption, etc. as part of the 
&#62; history of their character.  I think this breaches the boundary 
&#62; between the RPG and RL, and is not proper roleplaying (but, then, I 
&#62; am a roleplaying purist at heart).  (Despite the fact that I sign 
&#62; these posts with my character's name, these posts are not part of my 
&#62; character's &#34;history.&#34;)
&#62; 
&#62; Once again this is longer than intended.  Sorry . . .
