&#62; Just what is seeding and how is it done?? Sorry if this is a stupid 
&#62; question, I am just curious.

Seeding is not something you do as a player, it is a theory that was 
thought of to explain how item drops, Griswald, Adria and Wirt items 
were generated.  In very very simplistic terms (and I mean barebones 
here), lets say there are only three chests in the game and five 
possible items.

Item 1       Rags      Item code:  10 and below
Item 2       Demonspike Coat  Item code 10-19
Item 3       Obsidian Ring of the Zodiac  Item code 20-29
Item 4       Royal Circlet  Item Code 30-39
Item 5       Windforce.  Item Code 40 and up.


The equation that generates magic items in the chests is:

Chest 1     (Seed +1)*10
Chest 2     (Seed +2)*10
Chest 3     (Seed +3)*10

If you start a game and the seed is 1 

then you will get a Demonspike Coat from Chest 1
                           a Royal Circlet from Chest 2
                    and a Windforce from Chest 3.

You have got a &#34;Good seed game&#34;

If you start a game and the seed is -4
 
then you will get Rags, Rags, and Rags


You see, its just a way to show how Diablo calculates what items will 
be found and which ones will appear in the shops.

Again, this is a really simplistic model of seeding, so back off 
flamers. and again, this has not been proven or shown to have any 
ounce of significance (other than the fact that items tend to come in 
runs, ie lots of &#34;of Light&#34; items in one game etc.

The question, however, is since you can not see the formula, but only 
its results, is there a way to predict some results from others.  We 
have thought, yes, there is a correlation between items found in Gris 
and items found in the Dungeon because they are generated from the 
same seed.  

Then the next question is, can you affect what seed you get, hence 
the naked start theory. (if you start the game with all equipment in 
inventory you get a better seed).

I'd love to write more, but I'm at work.  If you want to know more, 
scroll back and look for seeding posts, they're all over.</pre>
