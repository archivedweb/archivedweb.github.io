<pre>Geez Aahz.  I can't believe I have been playing with you all this 
time and you have been restoring.  Sorry, but I don't know if I can 
ever look you in the face again.  I also am going to have to retract 
the invite on the Godparent thing.  Not to mention the whole thing 
about cats and dogs living together.  I even heard you like inter-
league play in baseball.  What are you a barbarian or something?  
It's people like you that are causing the total degredation of the 
moral fabric that the United States was founded on.  I fart in your 
general direction.

Dissappointed beyond belief,

&#62; Sorry, I don't have the kind of time you do.  I love building up my 
&#62; character, and he certainly has become my alter ego.  If I lost Aahz 
&#62; due to a hard drive crash I would most certainly restore.  Accuse me 
&#62; of cheating if you will:  I don't care.  I honestly don't give a damn 
&#62; who considers me legit or not.  I play to have fun.  I like to 
&#62; believe that the people I play with find it useful to have me around. 
&#62;  As a great philosopher once said:
&#62; 
&#62; &#34;I backup; therefore, I am.&#34;  
&#62; 
&#62; No, wait, that doesn't sound right all of a sudden.  Anyway, I find 
&#62; it highly unlikely that Blizzard ever intended a hard drive crash to 
&#62; be part of your character's history.  I also doubt they ever wanted 
&#62; to punish you because their server and your computer temporarily got 
&#62; miffed at each other and decided to disconnect, robbing you of your 
&#62; hard-earned gold and backup equipment.  Therefore, I NEVER consider 
&#62; backing up cheating, and I do believe there are times when RESTORING 
&#62; is also legal.
&#62; 
&#62; Have fun all,
&#62;
