<pre>not to long ago i restarted a new rogue character.  i levelled up 
pretty fast but i would like to hear your ideas on how i could have 
build up my character better.

ok, this is how i built this character up.  i only play about 1 to 2 
hours each weeknight and even less during the weekends (kinda 
sporatic since the summer started).  
the first 3 days were pretty easy, i did church/cats/caves until i 
hit about 17 solo.  Then i played with a similarly leveled friend in 
caves/hell to hit level 20.  there i played alot of solo church.  i 
levelled about 1.5 per day.  when i hit 23 i hit the cats.  at about 
26 i did hell/normal solo and cats/caves nightmare solo.  i was able 
to hit 30 pretty fast and i found some descent stuff.

        -ring of zod (laz gave it to me :)
        -ring of heavens (from an advocate)
        -gold am of precc. (from one of those boss witches)
        -savage  bow of heaven (from griz)
        -garnet armor of the stars (the unique guy in level 16)

when i got to 30 i started to do church hell.  a clan mate got me a 
saintly armor of the stars from griz (he was level 37).
well after doing a lot of church hell and then cats hell i'm now 
level 35 and pretty close to level 36 (tonight i think i'll get 
there).
i lost all my items once so now i have:

        -ring of zod (traded with a guild mate for a drake's ring of 
wiz)
        -dragon's ring of lion (gift from another guild mate)
        -am of wiz (got from laz)
        -emeral bow of heavens 
        - the saintly plate (only i was able to recover)
        -holy helm

i levelled pretty fast, the big backdrop is that i spent a lot of 
time underground so i would only get to see the witch about 3 times a 
game (when i join the game, once for refuelling/repairs, and when i 
finished my objective)  so not all my spells and stats are that high. 
 i maxed all except for dex (where i still have about 90 to go) some 
spells in my first page are maxed, like heal :) but my other spells 
are still low.  i only found 3 enchanted shrines in all the games, 2 
when i was below level 10 (big whoop) and 1 yesterday :).  

right now i do alot of church/cats runs.  i get about 3 mil exp in 
the church in about 15 minutes and 5.7 mil exp in the cats in about 
40 minutes.  i only have to go back up only once.

i have not done nightmare caves/hell a lot so i don't know how much 
exp/minutes i would get.  so if you know a better exp/minutes level 
out there, i would love the input.
