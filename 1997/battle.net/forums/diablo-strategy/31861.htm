<pre>OK, guys who care (Dark, Aahz are probably the only 2!!),
I've had a change of heart after some thought (with a little help
from my friends . . .)


&#62; it was definitly a 100&#37; legit game in my opinion. this is a multi 
&#62; player game. if u wanna finish hell by urself, then why play with 
&#62; others. we might be high levels but we could die in nite hell, or at 
&#62; least me, i almost died in a few cases, just in case u dont know. as 
&#62; for stoning the monsters, yes its easier but its tactics! not 
&#62; cheating. a level 30 mage would ve done or should ve done the same 
&#62; thing when they r accompanyed by a rogue. we help each other out. 
&#62; think about it, if we werent there, aahz would spend a lot more time 
&#62; clearing those soul burners in level 15. now was he cheating then? 
&#62; hell no. this is what u do in a co op games. u help each other out. 
&#62; thats the fun part.
  Yes, our game was 100&#37; legit.  The problems I had were becuase 
of the disparity in levels; I felt like a 5th wheel sometimes.  It 
took a good 15+of my arrows to match maybe 6-8 of Snipe's (may I call 
you that?  :-}) I realize that, if I had just had a more powerful bow 
(perhaps Windy--no, Dizzy, I WON'T bring it up again!!), I would have 
definitely been more effective.
  But, I stil did have fun--especially when I thought I was doing 
stuff that was actually helping the group.  (watching your arrows AND
mine hitting the same guy in a cool crossfire was absolutely WICKED!)

 
&#62; one more thing i dont see the level thing as any thing huge. u can 
&#62; find any items that i had on, and the only difference in my rogue 
&#62; than urs is the dex. and 18hp and 18 manas or something like that. 
&#62; other than that we r almost the same. its not the level of the 
&#62; character, is ur skills. 

I'll have to agree--skills/tactics really make you the effective 
player, not a pile of numbers (but the numbers sure to help!)


&#62; anyhow, i absolutly disagree with u calling last nite game not 
&#62; 100&#37; legit. i would play 1000 of these games if i can. cos i 
&#62; enjoyed it so much.
 Upon reflection, so do I!  I guess I took for granted that we really
WERE making a good team.  We rarely got in each other's way, and you
and I made (relatively) short work of Aahz's statues.  I guess that's
how you play multi . . . and I would do it again!


&#62; cya tonite! and we will have a 100&#37; legit game again =)
  Unfortunately, DS, I will not be on bnet again for awhile.  
&#60;sob&#62;
However, I WILL let you know the next time I can swing  it (right, 
Dizzy???  Maybe C WILL lapdance . . . YIKES!! hubba-hubba--but I 
digress)
  I mentioned to Aahz--it would be kinda cool to start a group of new
characters, and develop them as a team, watch 'em grow, really develop
tactics . . . whadayathink??
