<pre>OK, so if Stone Cursing a monster does not give you any exp when it 
dies,
I have another question for you.

Many people here seem to like the idea of going into hell with a mage 
and
a rogue, or rogues and a mage of any combination...

The favorite strategy seems to be to have the mage stone the monsters 
(the immune
all's specifically) and have the rogue pick them off.

If that is the case, won't problems arise since the Rogue is 
obtaining all the Experience?

I know personally, since I'd be the mage, I'd be kinda pissed... :)

&#62; &#62; I have a question for all you Diablo experts out there concerning
&#62; &#62; the delegation of experience in multi-player games.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; When multiple people are attacking monsters, how is experience
&#62; &#62; allocated?
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; I've been trying to figure this out.  It seemed to me at first that
&#62; &#62; if 2 players were on the same screen as a monster and the monster
&#62; &#62; died, then both gained EXP...however after some experimenting only
&#62; &#62; sometimes did that occur...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; So I have a new theory that seems to hold, and that is:
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   You gain experience from a monsters death if you have somehow
&#62; &#62; contributed to damaging that creature...so if you hit it for 1 damage,
&#62; &#62; you get experience when it dies. No matter if you kill it or not.
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62;   Is this correct?
&#62; 
&#62; While I do not know the exact method of how exp is divided, I do know 
&#62; for a FACT that this is the case. Pat over in Tech Support as said a 
&#62; few times that if two players attack a creature, all those who caused 
&#62; damage to the creature get exp. The exact amount you get.... I have 
&#62; no idea.
&#62; 
&#62; 
&#62;  
&#62; &#62;   Also, if that is to a point correct, what about spells like golem
&#62; &#62; and guardian or stone curse?  Golem and guardian are sort of indirect
&#62; &#62; ways to damage a creature so would that count toward gaining EXP from
&#62; &#62; a monsters death? And what about stone curse? If you stone something,
&#62; &#62; do you get exp when it dies? If so, then that would lead me to believe
&#62; &#62; that you gain EXP if you hit a creature with ANYTHING, rather than
&#62; &#62; actually doing damage to it...
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; 
&#62; &#62; Xiximarizanix, Mage
&#62; 
&#62; You get Exp from any spell that affects the monster prior to death 
&#62; with the exception of StoneCurse. I really haven't paid attention to 
&#62; exp allotments of multiplayer kills, but I think as StoneCurse 
&#62; doesn't affect the monsters damage, you don't get exp for stoneing 
&#62; while the other person kills (I noticed something else about SC that 
&#62; I really don't want to explain that also backs this up).
&#62; 
&#62; I hope this helps a little.
