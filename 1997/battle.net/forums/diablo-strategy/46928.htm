&#62; &#62; Just what is seeding and how is it done?? Sorry if this is a stupid 
&#62; &#62; question, I am just curious.
&#62; 
&#62; It's also referred to as overseeding or top seeding.  It's usually 
&#62; done in the Fall after a lawn has been aerated.  Try to collect all 
&#62; the soil plugs prior to speading the seed.  In cooler climates I 
&#62; recommend 31&#34; Tall Fescue.  Make sure your seed is at least 
&#62; 98&#37; pure.  More than 2&#37; weed seed can cause you problems.  
&#62; Using a caster spreader, a setting of 5-7 should be right, depending 
&#62; on your model.  Most seed companies have a chart on the bag for 
&#62; spreader settings.  One pound should cover approx. 1000 sq. ft.  
&#62; Water heavily after seeding and keep the ground moist, but not wet, 
&#62; at least 3-4 weeks.  Ground cover, such as straw, should not be 
&#62; necessary.  Growth should start appearing in a week to 10 days.  When 
&#62; top seeding, don't expect to get more than 20-25&#37; germination.  
&#62; Do not fertilize young grass as it can kill it.  In the Spring, water 
&#62; your new growth heavily and fertilize as usual.  Remember, a thick 
&#62; lawn is on weed comtrol.
&#62; 
&#62; Hope this was helpful.  If you have any further questions please 
&#62; direct them to your local lawn and garden shop, as this is a strategy 
&#62; group for players of the computer game Diablo.

It wasn't a stupid question, but this was a stupid answer!
