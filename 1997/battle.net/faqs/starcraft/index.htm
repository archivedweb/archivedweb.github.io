Are there "farms" in Starcraft?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes and no. Each species in Starcraft must provide "Support" for its units, but the exact type of Support required varies from race to race. A commander who finds him/herself running low on Support will be unable to produce any more troops. Also, different troop types require varying levels of Support-- a Terran Battlecruiser requires a much larger cache of spare parts and fuel than a single Marine. Here's a quick summary of Support for each species:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/terran.htm">Terrans:</a> The personnel and vehicles used by the Terran military require a stockpile of food, fuel, and spare parts. Supply Depots must be built to contain these vital components and keep the Terran military running smoothly. Supply Depots work like Farms from Warcraft II.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/protoss.htm">Protoss:</a> Pylons not only provide power for Protoss buildings (<a href="#pylon">see below</a>), but they also maintain the link that Protoss soldiers and war machnines need to tap into the shared Protoss psionic energy matrix. Although units are not restricted to staying within a short distance of Pylons, like buildings are, they still need an anchor to the psi matrix before they can be teleported into a Protoss base.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/zerg.htm">Zerg:</a> The Zerg Overmind maintains a psychic link to all of its children, but giving specific orders to individual Zerg creatures is left to the docile Overlords. Zerg Overlords relay the Overmind's wishes to the entire Zerg hive, direct attacks and expansion, and keep the natural instincts of the individual breeds from interfering with the Overmind's greater plan.<p>
</ul>

<b>What is Starcraft?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Starcraft is Blizzard's upcoming real-time strategy game of galactic conflict between three different species on the edge of known space. As the military leader for your people, you must gather the resources you need to raise a military force capable of dominating your enemies.
</font><p>

How is it going to be different from Warcraft II?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
The biggest difference is that Starcraft features three main species that you can control, each of which has unique units, buildings, and abilities. Other key features include native Win95 support, an isometric viewpoint, and Internet play through Battle.net. For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/star.htm">Starcraft Home Page</a>.
</font><p>

When is Starcraft coming out? Will there be a demo for it?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
We're currently looking at an early 1998 release. The shareware version will be available shortly after the release of the full game.
</font><p>

What about the Macintosh version?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
We have a separate Mac development team that is working closely with the main Starcraft team. Our plan is to release the Mac version of Starcraft as close to the Win95 version as we can.
</font><p>

Is there going to be a public beta test for Starcraft? If so, how can I sign up?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes, we had a signup for potential testers December 19th-21st. We will be choosing 1,000 testers from everyone who applied. The public beta test will be conducted over Battle.net (only).</font><p>

Will Starcraft run under WinNT 4.0? What about Win98? MacOS 8.0? Is it DirectX 5.0 compatible?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes to all.
</font><p>

<img src="SpeciesRule.GIF" alt="Species Info" border=0 width=640 height=19><p>

What are the three species? What are they like?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/terran.htm">Terrans:</a> Descendants of modern humans, banished from Earth for long-forgotten crimes. The Terrans will be the species most familiar to real-time strategy gamers, as they are the most traditional. They can build mobile bases and their military ranges from the expendable (but effective) Marine to the mighty Battlecruiser.

<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/protoss.htm">Protoss:</a> A race of highly advanced psychics. They have better technology than the Terrans, and can use special psychic abilities in combat, but aren't as prolific. 

<li><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/star/zerg.htm">Zerg:</a> Actually several different species of creatures, the Zerg are a mysterious, predatory group of biological terrors. Their units appear to be specially bred, rather than manufactured, and their "bases" are living organisms.

</ul>
</font><br>

What specific units/buildings/technologies/etc will be in the game?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
We're still balancing out a lot of the powers that each species has, and adding/removing abilities as we test them out. We'll be releasing more specific info as the game progresses, but for right now we just can't give detailed, specific info on a lot of the units. 
</font><p>

Do all three species have some form of cloaking/invisibility?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes, they do, but it's quite different for each species.
<ul>
<li><font color="white">Terrans</font><br>
Recent advancements in stealth technology have led to the development of small but energy-hungry "cloaking" systems. The Wraith Space Superiority Fighter and Ghost agents both have cloaking systems which can be active even when the unit is attacking-- Ghosts can call down a nuclear strike while cloaked..! The cloaking systems have limited energy reserves that take time to recharge.<br><br>

<li><font color="white">Protoss</font><br>
Using a combination of high technology and their innate psionic abilities, the Protoss have developed very powerful spatial distortion systems that can render units invisible without requiring a massive influx of energy. The Protoss Arbiter generates a distortion field that covers any friendly unit within its range, all the time. This makes a single Arbiter an intimidating site, since one can never be sure just how many ships are really present. (Fortunately for the other species, Arbiters have no effect on each other.) The Protoss Witness uses a much smaller field generator to keep itself concealed at all times, but it cannot affect other units.<br><br>

<li><font color="white">Zerg</font><br>
Although they don't have access to the high technology or psionic abilities of the other species, the Zerg have natural camouflage abilities that are developed much earlier in the game.  All Zerg ground units, except the massive Ultralisk, can burrow a short distance into the ground to conceal themselves.  (This includes the specialty units-- imagine Mages and Sappers who can go invisible at will...) While burrowed, they can’t move or attack but they still regenerate. This makes them very difficult to eradicate.

</ul>

Naturally, each species has also developed units that can detect hidden enemies and counter the effects of stealth... But we'll save that discussion for later.<p>
</font>

<a name="pylon">
What's this I hear about Protoss buildings needing energy?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Protoss technology draws its energy from a psionic web generated by nodes arrayed around the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. An off-world Protoss colony must be able to tap into this energy matrix to power its buildings.<p>

The central building of a Protoss colony is called a Nexus. The Nexus maintains a link to Aiur and can provide power to any buildings in close proximity. Floating Pylons are used to channel this psionic energy and extend the range of the energy web. By building a network of Pylons, the Protoss can expand their base as they grow.<p>

All other structures can only be gated in within the influence range of a Pylon or Nexus. If something happens to their power (e.g., the Pylons are destroyed) they shut down until they can be reconnected to the web.<p>

This requires a Protoss player to be organized about building extra Pylons, reinforcing his/her defenses with Shield Batteries, and maximizing land usage. We've noticed that programmers tend to like the Protoss. ; )<p>
</font>

Can enemy buildings be captured?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">

Not exactly, but there are a couple of situations where you can use an enemy's building against him/her.
<ol>
<li>Abandoned add-ons. Most of the mobile Terran buildings can build "add-ons" that expand their capabilities. For example, a Factory needs an attached Machine Shop to produce Siege Tanks. The add-ons aren't mobile, though, so if you move your Factory, you have to abandon the Machine Shop. This means that not only does you Factory not have the Machine Shop, but another Terran player can land a Factory next to the Machine Shop and take it over.<p>

<li>Zerg infestation. Zerg Queens have the ability to take over heavily damaged Terran Command Centers by landing on the building and "infesting" it. Once a Center has been infested, it falls under the control of the Zerg player. Although the building can no longer manufacture its normal units, it can produce infested Terran soldiers, which are the poor occupants of the building that have taken over by the Zerg Overmind. The scary part is that the infested Terrans themselves are infected with a highly volatile, cancer-like virus that makes them very... Explosive.
</ol>
You'll notice that the Terrans are particularly vulnerable to having their buildings taken away. That's the danger of making mobile buildings with modular technology. : )<p>
</font>

What does the Zerg Queen do? Can she create larvae?
<font color="#9999cc">
<br>
No, the Zerg Queen doesn't create larvae-- that's the job of the Hatchery. Her "Queen" status comes from her ability to spawn numerous other tiny Zerg critters. Her abilities include:
<ul>
<li><font color="#ffffff"><b>Spore Cluster:</b></font>
The Queen attacks by lobbing a cluster of acidic spores at her enemies. The cluster breaks open upon impact, and the spores can rapidly spread to nearby targets, although they do lose potency with each new target.
<p>
<li><font color="#ffffff"><b>Spawn Broodling:</b></font>
The Queen injects her hapless victim with a tiny egg that rapidly metabolizes into twin Broodlings. This tends to cause the unfortunate carrier to explode violently. The Broodlings, though short-lived, are aggressive and will seek out any nearby enemies to attack. Note that only non-robotic ground units can be infected.
<p>   
<li><font color="#ffffff"><b>Attach Parasite:</b></font>
Launches a tiny parasitic creature (simliar to a remora) that will attach itself to the target and provide the Overmind with intelligence information (i.e., you see what the unit sees.) The Parasite is small enough that it can only be detected by selecting the individual unit that it's attached to, and it cannot be removed without destroying the host.
<p>
<li><font color="#ffffff"><b>Infestation:</b></font>
By landing on a Terran Command Center and working her vile magic, the Queen can "infest" the center and turn its inhabitants into slaves of the Overmind. These infested Terrans are extremely unstable. ; )<br>

</ul>
</font>
<img src="FeaturesRule.GIF" alt="Features" border=0 width=640 height=19><p>

Will there be a map/unit editor? Will it have new features?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes, there will be a full scenario editor, which will include the ability to create custom campaigns, alter scenario objectives, and more.
</font><p>

Will you be able to have multiple objectives in a mission?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes.  In fact, with the Campaign Editor, you can not only specify multiple mission objectives for one player, but different sets of objectives for different players. When making a multiplayer scenario, the map creator defines what we call <font color="#ffffff">Forces</font>, which are groups of players who share a common set of mission objectives, and then chooses what the objectives are for each Force.<p>

Here’s an example:<p>
<i>Lt. Kerrigan is a unique Ghost, and the Kyadarin Crystal Formation is a Protoss monument.</i><p>
Force One -- Terran Saboteurs
<ul>
<li>Rescue Lt. Kerrigan<br>
<li>Bring Lt. Kerrigan to Kyadarin Crystal Formation<br>
    <font color="#ffffff">OR</font>
<li>Destroy the Kyadarin Crystal Formation
</ul>

Force Two -- Protoss Defenders
<ul>
<li>Kill Lt. Kerrigan<br>
    <font color="#ffffff">OR</font>
<li>Survive for 45 minutes
</ul>
</font>
<p>

What are some new features in multiplayer Starcraft, especially over Battle.net?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
There will be several different game types, including Capture the Flag, Sudden Death, and Greed. <font color="#ffffff">Teams</font> will also be supported, where several players can share the same pool of resources, technology, and units. Players will be able to transfer scenario files dynamically, and Battle.net will feature unique IDs and an optional ranking system.
</font><p>

What are my diplomatic options in multiplayer?
<font color="#9999cc">
<br>
You can set your Diplomatic Status with another player to either Enemy or Ally, which determines whether your units will attack that player's units/buildings automatically. In addition, you can choose to share your map information with any player, including Observers.
<p>
<font color="#ffffff">Team</font> play also adds a whole new level to play. Set before the game starts, a Team is effectively one side controlled by two or more players. Resources, technologies, and vision is all shared by the Team members, who don't have to play the same species. Unit control is also shared-- units that are currently selected by your teammates are marked so that you won't accidentally override your teammate's orders.
<p>
</font>

What's the music like?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Each species has its own style of music.
</font><p>

Will there be a maximum number of units that can be in a game?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
We have to restrict the number of units that can be in a game to keep it running quickly without an excessive memory overhead. We expect that the limit to be much higher than it was in Warcraft II.
</font><p>

<img src="ForumsRule.GIF" alt="Forum Questions" border=0 width=640 height=19><p>

Does Blizzard really read the <a href="http://www.battle.net/forums/starcraft-suggestions/index.htm">Starcraft Suggestions</a>?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes, we sure do. We also respond when we can, but we're working as hard as we can to finish Starcraft, so we can't answer every question. In general, we prefer to compile several questions into what has become known as the <font color="#ffffff">uberlist</font>, which is posted every week or so.
</font><p>

Uberlist? What's that?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Every so often our support folks round up a bunch of the questions that have been asked on the forums, and forward them to the Starcraft development team (aka the Zen masters) to answer as they will. We try and post a new uberlist near the beginning of each week. "Uberlist" can be loosely translated as "over list" or "all-encompassing list."
</font><p>

What did you think about my idea for...?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Sorry, but we really can't comment on specific suggestions. 
</font><p>

Are there going to be any additional Starcraft forums added?<br>
<font color="#9999cc">
Yes, we'll be adding a few new Starcraft forums once the game is released, and possibly when the public beta is released.
