Leoric was originally from the northern kingdom of Westmarch. He came into Khandaras as a holy warrior, a follower of Zakarum, the religion of Light. He declared himself king and chose to build his castle not far from the town of Tristram. His castle and the town were built over the site of an ancient monastary of mage-warriors, which was rumoured to hold much power within its halls.<br><br>

The people of Khandaras quickly accepted Leoric as their rightful king, for his reign was just and they felt that he could protect them from the forces of Darkness. As time passed, however, a change came over Leoric. He became convinced that his closest advisors were plotting against him, and that his court was corrupt. He began to confide only in the Archbishop Lazarus. Believing that his own homeland, Westmarch, was planning an invasion, he declared war against the other nation and ordered his armies and advisors north to their certain doom.<br><br>

Not long afterwards, Leoric's only son, Albrecht, vanished. Leoric was enraged, and what sanity he had been holding onto was lost. He believed that his son had been kidnapped by the townspeople of Tristram to protest the war against Westmarch. He destroyed much of the town in his search for Albrecht and executed those that he believed withheld information from him.<br><br>

Just as Leoric was about to order the entire town put to the torch, news of his army's defeat in Westmarch reached him. Lachdanan, a great hero of the Church and Captain of the King's Army, arrived in Tristram with the remnants of his company. Lachdanan saw that Leoric had fallen completely into madness, and begged the king to concede his throne. Leoric refused. He accused Lachdanan of treason and  ordered his personal guards to execute Lachdanan. A great fight broke out in the halls of the cathedral between Lachdanan's soldiers and the King's guard, and the battle carried down into the labyrinth below.<br><br clear=left>

Lachdanan himself delivered the killing blow to Leoric, though his heart was filled with sadness as he was forced to betray the very king that he had sworn to protect. With his dying breath, Leoric cursed Lachdanan and his attackers to an unlife of eternal damnation.<br><br>
