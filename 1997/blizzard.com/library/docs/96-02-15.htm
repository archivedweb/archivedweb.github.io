Warcraft II Named Game of the Year</font></b></center><br><br>

IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 15, 1996 — Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness from Blizzard Entertainment is the best game of 1995, according to leading game magazine PC Gamer. In the magazine’s March issue, Warcraft II is named Game of the Year, as well as Best Multi-Player Game of the Year. In the same issue, the game receives the magazine’s Editor’s Choice award after earning a 96-percent review rating.<br><br>

The magazine singles out Warcraft II — the sequel to 1994’s best-selling Warcraft: Orcs and Humans — from all other entertainment titles released in 1995 based on key features such as the game’s multiplayer option for as many as eight players; improved interface; a four-times larger map; Super VGA graphics; a map builder to customize games; and a multitude of new units and buildings for land, sea and air combat.<br><br>

Said Dan Bennett, editor of PC Gamer, “It’s almost never one big idea that makes a game great; it’s a lot of little things - like listening to suggestions from customers. Attention to this kind of detail is what makes Warcraft II a gaming classic and our choice for the best game of 1995.”<br><br>

In the awards issue, the magazine’s editors stated, “There were plenty of other great games in 1995, but no one loved the real-time strategy action of Warcraft II more than the staff of PC Gamer. Warcraft II stands out — way out — as the most impressive, most entertaining game of the year and one we’ll be playing long into 1996.”<br><br>

Said Allen Adham, president and founder of Blizzard Entertainment, “We are excited that Warcraft II has been selected as Game of the Year. To be recognized by the magazine’s editors, who are diehard gamers just like us, means that we have succeeded in offering our customers high-quality, addictive game play that exceeds their expectations.<br><br>

“Winning Best Multi-Player game is equally important to us, because we fully believe that the ability to compete head-to-head against friends has been a key factor in driving the tremendous popularity of Warcraft II.”<br><br>

Warcraft II is available immediately in DOS CD-ROM format at most computer and software retail chains nationwide and is priced at approximately $50. The game is also offered directly from Blizzard at (800) 953-SNOW. A Macintosh version of the game is expected to release this fall.<br><br>
