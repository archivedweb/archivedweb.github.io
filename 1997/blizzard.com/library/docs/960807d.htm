Blizzard Entertainment Announces Diablo for the Macintosh</font></b></center><br><br>

<i>Maker of award-winning Warcraft series introduces new RPG
                in which supernatural forces and demonic creatures 
              await players as they descend into an evil underworld</i><br><br>

	<i>BOSTON,  Aug. 7, 1996</i> -- At MacWorld starting today, Blizzard 
     Entertainment announced plans for a Macintosh version of <a href="../../diablo/diablo.htm"><i>Diablo</i></a>, a new 
     role-playing game in which players descend into a sinister underworld 
     filled with supernatural forces and demonic creatures.<br><br>

        <i>Diablo</i> transports players to a medieval village plagued with evil 
     and darkness.  In a quest for vengeance, the central character 
     descends into a crypt and expansive labyrinth hidden beneath the 
     village.  Game play focuses on exploration, conflict and character 
     development as players travel deeper into the underworld’s demonic 
     halls.<br><br>

        <i>Diablo</i> will be available in Macintosh 
     CD-ROM format at most computer and software retail chains nationwide 
     for approximately $50.  The game will also be available directly 
     through Blizzard at (800) 953-SNOW.<br><br>

        Says Allen Adham, president and founder of Blizzard Entertainment, 
     “<i>Diablo</i> will offer gamers a new kind of role-playing game.  The game 
     boasts not only fully rendered graphics never seen before in an RPG, 
     but also unlimited replayability. Each time a quest begins, <i>Diablo</i>’s 
     random level generator creates a completely different labyrinth.  With 
     every game, players can expect to see a room, corridor, monster, trap 
     or treasure in a way that they have never encountered before.”  <br><br>

	<b>Product Overview</b><br>
	As the central character in <i>Diablo</i>, players explore a dungeon 
     hidden beneath a desecrated church in their village.  Players can 
     choose from three different character types: a fighter, rogue or 
     sorceror -- each with distinct abilities and strengths.   As players 
     encounter numerous levels filled with corridors, traps, weapons, 
     magical items, non-playing characters and demonic creatures, 
     the truth about what evil force decimated their village begins to 
     unravel.<br><br>    

        <i>Diablo</i> includes multiplayer support for as many as four players 
     and one-click free access to on-line gaming via the company’s 
     <a href="http://www.battle.net/index.htm">Battle.net</a> service.  Blizzard’s Battle.net provides an arena for 
     Blizzard customers to chat, challenge opponents and initiate 
     multiplayer games. <br><br>
