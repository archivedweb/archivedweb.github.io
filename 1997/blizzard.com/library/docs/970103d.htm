	<i>IRVINE, Calif.,  Jan. 3, 1997</i> - Blizzard Entertainment this week shipped <b><a href="../../diablo/diablo.htm"><I>Diablo</I></a></b>, the much anticipated role-playing game in which players enter a sinister underworld filled with supernatural forces and demonic creatures.  The game is the first Blizzard title to take advantage of <b><a href="http://www.battle.net">Battle.net</a></b>, the company's new on-line gaming service which provides free access to multiplayer gameplay over the Internet. <br><br>
	<I>Diablo</I> transports players to a medieval village plagued with evil and darkness.  In a quest for vengeance, the central character descends into a crypt and expansive labyrinth hidden beneath the village.  Game play focuses on exploration, conflict and character development as players travel deeper into the underworld's demonic halls. <br><br>
	<I>Diablo</I> is available immediately in Windows95 CD-ROM format at most computer and software retail chains nationwide for approximately $50.  The game is also available directly through Blizzard at (800) 953-SNOW. <br><br>
	Says Allen Adham, president and founder of Blizzard Entertainment, "<I>Diablo</I> offers gamers a new kind of role-playing game.  The game boasts not only great fully rendered three-dimensional SVGA graphics never seen before in an RPG, but also unlimited replayability. Each time a quest begins, <I>Diablo</I>'s random level generator creates a completely different labyrinth.  With every game, players can expect to see a room, corridor, monster, trap or treasure in a way never encountered before." <br><br>
<b><a href="http://www.battle.net">Battle.net</a> - Free On-Line Gaming Service</b><br>
	<I>Diablo</I> is the first game to offer easy access to free on-line gaming.  Players simply select the Battle.net multiplayer option, and they are automatically connected to Blizzard's free Internet gaming service.  Once logged on, players can compete head-to-head against players from around the world.  Blizzard charges no hourly or monthly fees to connect to Battle.net.  In order to play via Battle.net, access to the Internet is required, and players are responsible for applicable on-line access fees. <br><br>
	Blizzard Entertainment has teamed with <a href="http://www.primenet.com">Primenet Services</a> for the Internet and other Internet service providers to put Battle.net online.  Primenet's fully meshed ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network offers the high-speed, low-latency Internet connectivity essential for online gameplay. <br><br>
<b>Product Overview</b><br>
	As the central character in <I>Diablo</I>, players must explore a dungeon hidden beneath a desecrated church in their village.  As players encounter 16 levels filled with corridors, traps, weapons, magical items and demonic creatures, the truth about what evil force decimated their village begins to unravel. <br><br>
Three unique characters types allow gamers to play as a brave Warrior, a cunning Rogue, or a mysterious Sorcerer. As characters venture deeper into the labyrinth, they discover weapons, armor, and magical treasures, and develop their character's skills and abilities. <br><br>
