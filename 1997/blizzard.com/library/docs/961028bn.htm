</center></font></b>
<br><br>

<I>More than 250,000 gamers stay up all night for a chance to be the first to play Blizzard's much anticipated Diablo over the Internet</I><br><br>

<i>IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 28, 1996</i> -- Just like diehard fans who camp out all night to buy the hottest concert tickets, thousands of computer game enthusiasts from around the world recently stayed up most of the night for their chance to be one of 1,000 beta testers to play Blizzard Entertainment's soon-to-be-released <i><a href="../../diablo/diablo.htm">Diablo</a></i> over the Internet.<br><br>

Beta tester registration began at midnight Pacific time via the Internet. Within three minutes, the 1,000 slots for beta testing were full and within just a few hours, more than 250,000 requests poured in over Blizzard's server. Submissions came from around the world including Amsterdam, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.<br><br>

The beta testers, who provide their time and input for free, will be the first to play <i>Diablo</i> over the Internet using Blizzard's new <a href="http://www.battle.net">Battle.net</a> service, which allows gamers to compete in multiplayer games over the Internet for free. The testers will provide performance feedback on Battle.net as well as the multiplayer features in <i>Diablo</i>. <br><br>

"We were shocked by the tremendous response to our beta testing registration, but it reaffirmed our belief that gamers want to share their ideas and experiences with game developers," said Allen Adham, president of Blizzard Entertainment. "Beta testing gives our customers the opportunity to be active participants in the creation of our products, which in turn helps us make better games."<br><br>

Battle.net provides an arena for Blizzard customers to chat, challenge opponents and initiate multiplayer games. To access Battle.net, players simply select the Internet option from the game's main screen, and they are automatically connected to the service. Once logged on, players can compete head-to-head against players from around the world over the Internet. Blizzard charges no hourly or monthly fees to connect to Battle.net. The Battle.net service will be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br><br>

<i>Diablo</i> is a real-time role-playing game in which players descend into a sinister underworld filled with supernatural forces and demonic creatures. In a quest for vengeance, the central character enters a crypt and expansive labyrinth hidden beneath the village. Game play focuses on exploration, conflict and character development as players travel deeper into the underworld's demonic halls. As many as four players can compete head-to-head in multiplayer games.<br><br>

<i>Diablo</i> will be the first Blizzard title to take advantage of Battle.net. <i><a href="../../star/star.htm">Starcraft</a></i> and other future Blizzard titles will also offer access to Battle.net.<br><br>
