Blizzard Entertainment Introduces Battle.net<br>
A New Concept in Gaming Over the Internet</font></b></center><br><br>

<i>LOS ANGELES, May 16, 1996</i> -- At the Electronic Entertainment Expo starting today, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new concept in multiplayer competition over the Internet. Starting with <i><a href="../../diablo/diablo.htm">Diablo</a></i>, Blizzard will provide customers one-click free access to Internet gaming via the company’s <a href="http://www.battle.net">Battle.net</a> service.<br><br>

Battle.net provides an arena for Blizzard customers to chat, challenge opponents and initiate multiplayer games. To access Battle.net, players simply select the Internet option from the game’s main screen, and they are automatically connected to Battle.net. Once logged on, players can compete head-to-head against players from around the world over the Internet. Blizzard charges no hourly or monthly fees to connect to Battle.net. In order to play via Battle.net, access to the Internet is required, and players are responsible for applicable on-line access fees.<br><br>

“Internet gaming is the next level in computer entertainment, and we are dedicated to offering our customers the latest in on-line multiplayer technologies,” said Allen Adham, president and founder of Blizzard Entertainment. “The multiplayer option in our products is an integral part of the gaming experience, so we designed Battle.net to not only provide easy access to on-line competition, but to do so with no extra game charges to our customers.”<br><br>

The Battle.net service will be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Different channels allow players of varying skill levels to match wits with opponents of comparable abilities.<br><br>

<i><a href="../../star/star.htm">Diablo</a></i> will be the first Blizzard title to take advantage of the company’s new Battle.net service. <i><a href="../../star/star.htm">Starcraft</a></i> and other future Blizzard titles will also offer access to Battle.net.<br><br>

<i>Blizzard Entertainment is a premier publisher of next-generation entertainment software. The company’s blockbuster hits Warcraft and Warcraft II have earned top industry honors including Game of the Year and Best Multiplayer Game as well as high ratings and rave reviews from numerous gaming magazines. Blizzard is a division of <a href="http://www.davd.com">Davidson & Associates, Inc.</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="http://www.cuc.com">CUC International Inc.</a> (NYSE: CU).</i>
